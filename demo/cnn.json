    "content": "Fashion may not be the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about papal legacies, but Pope Francis, who died Monday, had an individual sense of style — one that didn’t include a cinched Balenciaga-like white puffer jacket ( ), but instead, for his unfussy cream-colored cassocks and sensible black leather shoes. Francis’ choice in footwear was first noted, just 24 hours after he was elected in 2013, by The New York Times, which that he had “dramatically shifted the tone of the papacy” with his black shoes — reportedly made by a friend in Buenos Aires, his hometown — and ordinary wristwatch. He quickly became known for his simple, often unadorned regalia, in contrast to his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who opted for gem-encrusted pectoral crosses, bright red designer loafers and archaic accessories — among them, a traditional velvet and ermine camauro that caught attention for its resemblance to a Santa hat. Accolades for Francis’ style soon followed: The Cut Francis the world’s “normcore pope” for his “simple, non-frilly” approach to dressing. He also became the first pontiff to land a Rolling Stone cover, and was by Esquire as 2013’s “Best-Dressed Man.” Not long after came the countless memes and unauthorized Etsy merch, with Francis’ likeness featured on a slew of T-shirts, sweatshirts and mugs in faux ‘90s bootleg designs. “While Bradley Cooper, Chris Pine, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt have all had banner years, their sartorial choices begin and end on the proverbial red carpet,” wrote Esquire’s Max Berlinger. “Meanwhile, Pope Francis’s sartorial decisions have subtly signaled a new era (and for many, renewed hope) for the Catholic Church.” The feature was one of Esquire’s best-performing stories for months, according to Berlinger, who was subsequently invited onto several morning news shows to explain his controversial decision (he declined). “I just thought it was cool and worth mentioning,” he told CNN in a phone interview. “The Pope before him wore a lot of really ornate, expensive clothing. (Francis) was going to jails and washing the feet of prisoners. I remember thinking that this was part of a bigger shift, and that his clothes were a visual manifestation.” Before the 2013 papal conclave, Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, wasn’t even considered as one of the top three frontrunners for the job. He appeared modest, humble and largely flew under the radar. But it was partly this understated demeanor, which differed so greatly to that of his predecessor, that sparked interest. “As the archbishop of Buenos Aires, Bergoglio had never been an especially gifted public speaker,” wrote Mark Binelli in the Rolling Stone’s cover story. “But now that he’s Pope Francis, his recognizable humanity comes off as positively revolutionary.” Though Francis’ style was often read as a show of his humility or asceticism, Carol Richardson, an ecclesiastical and art historian at the University of Edinburgh, said that the two popes’ sartorial contrasts represented deeper differences in their views on their roles as head of the Catholic Church. “Benedict XVI was playing with different periods of time through what he was wearing,” she explained in a video call. “As a traditionalist, (he was) asserting the historical continuity of the papacy.” By appearing in early Christian chasubles (a sleeveless outer vestment worn during mass), and Ancient Roman palliums (a cloth band that loops around the neck), he was asserting “an unbroken link” from Jesus to St. Peter, the first pope, and all the way through to Benedict himself, according to Richardson. Francis, being the first Jesuit pope, seemed to have different priorities, Richardson said, observing that Jesuits (originally known as the Society of Jesus) tend to “study languages, philosophy, and theology, history, rhetoric — it’s all about the application, the process of being a priest in the world,” she explained. “So there’s a practical application, which comes above any theoretical or historical interest.” Despite Francis’ minimization of symbolism, his all-white dress did bear meaning. White and red are the primary colors of papal dress, with white representing purity and charity, and red representing compassion and sacrifice. There are no papal requirements for footwear color, though socks have traditionally been white or red, too. (Francis wore black; Benedict, crisp white). Black, the color of his shoes, has no official symbolism, though Richardson pointed out that Franciscan friars, who preach poverty and charity, are known to wear black shoes and sandals. “(They) probably are just the shoes that he would have worn as a priest,” she said. When the AI-generated image of Francis dressed in high-fashion streetwear went viral, the depiction was particularly absurd for a holy leader, let alone one so modest in style. However, Richardson saw a hint of truth as to why the hoax photography resonated with internet users as much as it did. “Although it was fake, it was still a gentle compliment to a pope who follows tradition… but also the fact that they are priests in the world as it is today,” she said. “(It’s) understanding the past and the present to move into the future.”",

    "content": "Known as a tax haven and playground for the rich, Monaco packs a population of around 39,000 — of whom almost are millionaires, according to property firm Knight Frank — into an area smaller than New York’s Central Park. But the world’s second-smallest sovereign state has just grown by 3%. New “eco-district” Mareterra, which has been built into the Mediterranean Sea, expands the microstate’s land mass by almost 15 acres. Inaugurated by Monaco’s Prince Albert II on Wednesday, the €2 billion ($2.1 billion) luxury development features a marina, seaside promenade and swathes of new high-end housing. Announced in 2013, the extensive land reclamation project saw concrete chambers, or caissons, built in the sea before being drained of water and filled with 750,000 metric tons of sand. Around half of the artificial landmass will be publicly accessible, with amenities including a park, cycle paths, a marina and shopping facilities. The district’s various green spaces have been planted with 1,000 trees imported from Tuscany, Italy. New private residences on the site include more than 100 apartments and 10 palatial villas. Several high-profile architects, including Norman Foster and Tadao Ando, were commissioned to create structures in Mareterra. Italian architect Renzo Piano, best known for co-designing the Centre Pompidou, lent his name to the residential development building his firm designed on the site, Le Renzo. While housing prices have not been disclosed, Knight Frank estimates that properties in the district will fetch around 100,000 euros per square meter (or more than $9,750 per square foot, almost twice Monaco’s average). The development was privately funded, though Monaco’s government will benefit from a 20% tax on all property sales. The city state’s conference center, the Grimaldi Forum, was also expanded as part of the project. Land is notoriously scarce in Monaco, which has a long history of building into the sea. Reclaimed land now accounts for more than a quarter of the principality’s territory. The most significant reclamation projects took place in the 1960s and 1970s, when the Larvotto and Fontvieille districts were expanded into the Mediterranean. Earlier land reclamation efforts attracted the ire of environmentalists worried about the impact on Monaco’s marine life, which today includes 60 species of coral. A more recent proposal was abandoned in 2009 due, in part, to ecological concerns raised by Prince Albert II, who is renowned for his work protecting ocean biodiversity. Land reclamation in Monaco is now tightly regulated, and Mareterra’s developers said they took various steps to “minimize the impact on the natural ecosystem as much as possible.” The project’s website says planners consulted marine experts and created new habitats for fish, including artificial seagrass beds. Developers also claim that 80% of heating and cooling in the district will run on renewable energy, including the power generated by more than 1.2 acres of solar panels.",

    "content": "“Reservation Dogs” star D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai made a powerful statement on the red carpet at Sunday’s ceremony, pairing a black tuxedo with what looked like a bloody red handprint smeared across his mouth. The 22-year-old Canadian, who is of Oji-Cree First Nations descent, was the first Indigenous North American to be nominated in the ceremony’s leading actor category, according to . A red hand over the mouth has become the symbol of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women movement, which raises awareness of the Indigenous women missing and murdered across North America whose voices are not heard, . “I did this for those who ain’t here, not 4 me, not 4 y’all,” on his Instagram, sharing a photo from the red carpet. The murder rate for women on reservations in the United States is 10 times higher than the national average, and murder is the third leading cause of death for Native women, . In Canada, the number of Indigenous women and girls who have been killed or vanished is in the thousands. The Canadian government that they are 12 times more likely to go missing or be murdered than non-Indigenous women in the country. In 2016, the government launched a into missing and murdered women and girls. The inquiry found that the situation amounts to a “race-based genocide” of Indigenous peoples that especially targets women. has also said the number of those murdered or missing to amounts to a “genocidal crisis.” “I don’t know what an Emmy Award will really do for stopping issues that we face on a daily basis,” said Woon-A-Tai, news agency days before the ceremony on a call from Curve Lake First Nation reservation in Ontario. “It just gives us hope. It gives hope to a kid on a reservation that they could also be on that stage and do it too, and they can,” he added. Woon-A-Tai was nominated for his role as Bear Smallhill in the FX series “Reservation Dogs,” a comedy-drama that follows the lives of four Native American teenagers living on a reservation in Oklahoma. The show was the first American series written and directed entirely by Indigenous people and had a mostly Indigenous cast and crew. Actresses Kali Reis and Lily Gladstone also made history at this year’s Emmys, becoming the first Indigenous women to be nominated in the acting category, according to Variety.",

    "content": "A New York woman is challenging the longstanding rules of and that disqualify mothers from their beauty pageants. Danielle Hazel said Monday that she’s always dreamed of entering the competitions but was devastated to learn that she’s no longer eligible because she had a son when she was just 19 years old. “When I told Zion, who is now 6 years old, about these rules he had an immediate gut reaction: he said that these rules are stupid,” she said, speaking at the Women’s Rights Pioneers Monument in New York’s Central Park. “His sense of fairness at only 6 years old tells him that this is unjust and makes no sense.” Hazel’s lawyer, Gloria Allred, said a complaint sent Monday to the city’s Commission on Human Rights seeks an end to the requirements because they deny and exclude mothers from an “important business and cultural opportunity” simply because of their status as parents. “As we stated in Danielle‘s filed complaint, this exclusion is degrading to Danielle as it is based upon the antiquated stereotype that women cannot be both a mother and be beautiful, poised, passionate, talented and philanthropic,” Allred said. Spokespersons for the Miss America and Miss World pageant organizations didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment Monday. A spokesperson for the human rights commission said the agency does not comment on open investigations. Allred noted that she previously had success challenging a similar rule for a California mother denied eligibility to compete in the Miss California pageant, which is part of the and organizations. The discrimination complaint filed by Andrea Quiroga with the California Civil Rights Department prompted Miss Universe to eliminate its 70-year-old rule, which was imposed worldwide through its affiliated organizations, Allred said. “Being pregnant or being a parent is not a crime and should not exclude an individual from employment or business opportunities,” Allred said. “An individual’s status as a parent should not carry a stigma and no person should have to feel embarrassed, humiliated, or degraded because they have become a parent.” The two women were joined Monday by Veronika Didusenko, who was crowned Miss Ukraine 2018 only to have the when the Miss World organization learned that she had a child. Didusenko, who has since created an organization advocating for an end to beauty pageant bans on mothers, said she lost her legal challenge in Ukraine but is seeking relief from the European Court of Human Rights.",

    "content": "Applying makeup is a powerful ritual, deeply ingrained into our souls. Many little girls (or boys) have a story about the first time they dared to swipe their mother’s red lipstick across their lips or brush blue eyeshadow onto their eyelids. In Ancient Egypt, makeup was believed to appeal to the Gods; they used malachite eyeshadows, rouge, to signify their wealth and transform themselves into living works of art. Today, makeup is part of everyday life, part of how we see ourselves and how others see us. Growing up, I loved to gaze at models on the covers of magazines with their flawless skin, glossy lips, and perfectly applied eyeliner. I yearned to learn their magic. I used to think my older sister was a witch and her brushes her wands. I relished going into her room and asking her to paint my nails bright pink or apply my eyeshadow. She always worked with such precision — something I could never replicate, because my eyesight was slowly deteriorating. I was diagnosed with j (JIA) at the age of two, an autoimmune condition in which the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissues, causing widespread inflammation throughout the body. JIA affects approximately every 1 in 1,000 children in the UK under the age of 16, primarily targeting the joints but sometimes leading to complications in the eyes and other organs. In my case, the condition impacted my eyes, resulting in the development of chronic uveitis — a condition characterized by persistent eye inflammation, eventually leading to vision loss. Although surgery and treatment helped manage the inflammation, the damage was irreversible and triggered the onset of glaucoma, which increases pressure inside the eye, permanently damaging the nerve that links our brain to our eyes and enables us to see. As I grew up and my vision became more impaired, my relationship with makeup, and myself, started to crumble. I would often show up to school with patches of unblended foundation or uneven lip liner. I craved a sense of control over my life, and I was now too stubborn to let my sister or mom help me with my beauty routine despite my loss of vision. It was embarrassing, feeling as though I didn’t function like a real woman. I felt an equal mix of frustration and fear, knowing that my ability to express myself through makeup, to create art the way others could, was slipping away before I even had a chance to grasp it. To be able to accept my changing reality, I had to learn to accept myself. To accept that I would never see the world the same as my peers — and that this was OK. Once I began to make peace with this, I formed a new relationship with my beauty routine and eventually discovered what works for me. Aged 22, I am now registered blind. Contrary to what many people believe, blindness isn’t total darkness but exists on a spectrum. Some people may see only colors and light, while others might have parts of their vision obscured or their peripheral vision. Most of my vision is gone in my left eye, and I have no peripheral vision in my right, which has gotten progressively worse over the years. As of right now, my condition is stable, although this could change at any moment. As I grew up and my vision became more impaired, my relationship with makeup, and myself, started to crumble. Despite the obstacles I have faced, I haven’t let my disability stifle my determination and drive for success. From fundraising for charities to graduating from university and pursuing a career as a writer, I want to show that no matter what life throws at you, each of us has the power to decide who we want to be. Now, I enjoy my beauty rituals as much as anyone else. I have learnt the structure and shape of my face, from the width of my cheekbones to the length of my brows. I stay away from beauty blending tools instead sticking to using my fingers or brushes for blending and have fully embraced my sense of touch, to the point where I can now (quite literally) apply my makeup with my eyes closed. So adept have I become at the art of applying makeup, my sighted friends ask me for tips. Here are the main things I have learnt that work for me. Perhaps they’ll work for you too. My skin has always been relatively clear and free from texture, so I don’t invest in products that provide a lot of coverage. But before I understood foundation, I used to buy bottle after bottle of anything labeled “full coverage,” which only made any places I missed painfully obvious. Now, when I wear foundation, I opt for sheer or buildable coverage products. My current favorites are Charlotte Tilbury’s Hollywood Flawless Filter and Dior’s new Forever Skin Perfect stick. I used to avoid eye makeup because precision was never my strong suit. But experimenting with a smoky eye gave me the freedom to play with different looks without the pressure of nailing a perfect cut crease or winged liner. I love how a softly smudged smoky eye subtly enhances my eyes without overpowering them. Since I have two different colored eyes — one green and one blue — using a plum kohl liner and gently smudging it along my lash line brings out the color in both. Gone are my powder blushes, highlighters, and bronzers in favor of cream-based products which offer me a better sense of where and how much product I’ve applied. With powders, I would often go overboard because I couldn’t feel or see how much I was applying. Now, I achieve a subtle, natural look by feeling the amount of product on my face. And if I do apply too much, I find creams are easier to blend out. My relationship with makeup has taught me many things, but the most important lesson is that it’s okay to embrace your face. In a world saturated with perfect faces and rigid beauty standards, it’s easy to fall into the trap of comparison. But it’s important to remember that you are unique, and there’s nobody else with your essence. Though my sister and I no longer live together, we still bond over our shared love of makeup. I’ve memorized the contours of her face and occasionally apply her makeup too. We chat about the latest products and I still ask for her opinion on new looks I’m trying out. The difference now is that I no longer feel disappointed when I don’t get things exactly right. We’re all human, and beauty is often found in what we think are our flaws. So embrace your features — they are what make you, you.",

    "title": "\n      Meet the 80-year-old Miss Universe Korea contestant proving age is just a number\n    ",

    "content": "Born almost a decade before the first Miss Universe contest was held in 1952, 80-year-old Choi Soon-hwa could now make history as the pageant’s oldest ever participant. Earlier this month, she was unveiled as a finalist in the annual Miss Universe Korea competition. On Monday, Choi will go head-to-head with 31 other contestants for the tiara — and a chance to represent South Korea at the Miss Universe final in Mexico this November. “I want to stun the world, like, ‘How is an 80-year-old lady so healthy? How did she maintain that body? What’s your diet?’” she told CNN on the phone ahead of the pageant. “When you get old, you gain weight… So, I want to show that we can live healthily even when we get old.” For decades, the Miss Universe Organization enforced strict age restrictions limiting participation to women aged 18 to 28. But from 2024, amid growing calls to modernize, the upper age limit has been lifted. Last year, the organization also updated eligibility criteria to remove a longstanding ban on pregnant women or mothers, and women who were — or ever had been — married. National-level Miss Universe pageants, although not all directly administered by the Miss Universe Organization, were obliged to follow suit. This year, 58-year-old Lorraine Peters and 60-year-old Alejandra Marisa Rodríguez took part in Miss Universe Canada and Miss Universe Argentina, respectively, though neither advanced to November’s final. “Now that the age restriction has been lifted, I said, ‘I should give it a try,’” Choi said, adding: “Whether I get through or not, I was determined to try and get this opportunity.” Set to be the oldest person ever to participate in a national Miss Universe pageant, Choi — should she take the title and advance to Mexico — would be more than twice the age of the next oldest finalist ( of Malta is currently the oldest confirmed participant, and the mother of three children, although a handful of countries are yet to select their entrant). Organizers of Miss Universe Korea announced this year’s competition by claiming in promotional materials that “age doesn’t matter when it comes to dreaming.” They also removed its swimsuit segment. Monday’s pageant will see Choi take part in a singing contest, with other finalists performing dances or walking in traditional Korean clothing known as “hanbok.” The winner of Miss Universe Korea will be decided through a scoring system that considers online voting and judges’ assessments, which Choi said valued both “outer and inner beauty.” “Looking beautiful on the outside is important, but I think you need to be at ease in your mind as well, and know how to respect others,” she said, adding: “Also, you need to be a positive thinker. So many people are negative these days.” Korean pageants have been criticized in recent years for promoting a singular idea of beauty — one that detractors say is reinforced by some participants’ use of cosmetic surgery, which is typically not restricted by organizers. But Choi is unfazed by the development. “It’s hard to find people who haven’t done any touch-ups or plastic surgery, and I think it’s time we just embrace it,” she said. “A lot of people do their eyes or raise their nose… Back in the day, it used to be something others spoke ill of, but it’s not like that now. It’s not just Koreans — a lot of women around the world are undergoing plastic surgery.” While Monday’s contest marks Choi’s pageant debut, she has already made a name for herself in the Korean fashion world. After leaving retirement amid financial difficulties to work as a hospital carer in her 50s, Choi began modeling aged 72 to help pay off debts. “One of my patients told me to try modeling,” recalled Choi, adding: “I thought it was nonsense… but at the same time, it awoke my old dream of becoming a model, wearing pretty clothes and doing photo shoots. So, I said, ‘Yes, I used to dream of that before, I should try it.’” Choi took weekly classes at a modeling academy, practicing her runway walks down the hospital hallways during shifts. She signed to her teacher’s agency in 2017 before making her Seoul Fashion Week debut, aged 74, the next year. She has since appeared in the Korean editions of magazines including and , as well shooting commercial campaigns for brands including the popular South Korean beer, “Becoming a model was like opening a door to a new path for me, so I planned in my mind. I said, ‘I will be successful and work hard’…  When my dream came true, I thanked God and kept working hard. It’s so fun and I love it.” With a rapidly declining birth rate, South Korea is among the world’s fastest-aging countries. Earlier this year, the number of South Koreans aged 65 or above exceeded 10 million for the first time, representing almost 20% of the population. This figure is predicted to rise to 36.7% — higher than any other country — by 2044, according to . In turn, the opportunities for — and attitudes towards — older models are improving, according to Choi. “There are a lot of senior models these days,” she said. “But maybe (only a fraction of them) get to work and get paid. It is different for sure, compared to 10, 20 years ago though. Ten years ago, no one really looked for senior models. Elder models were just working as a hobby for fun, not as a paid job.” Choi believes her modeling experience will prove useful in the pageant world: “Walking a runway is a collaboration of shoulders, knees and hips. All the Miss Universe contestants are really good at walking like models. Some are even better than actual models.” The grandmother of three, who turns 81 next month, told CNN that she is excited by the prospect of representing her country overseas: “I always dreamed of going on stage abroad, so my mindset is prepared. Japan is the only other country I’ve been to, and I believe (pageant organizers) would teach the winner everything, so I’m ready!” She has the support, too, of her children and grandchildren. “They say they’re really proud of me like, ‘My granny is amazing!’… My son said he’s proud of me, and to enjoy it regardless of the outcome.”",

    "content": "We’d been on the road by 2 a.m., and after a missed flight and a seven-hour drive from upstate New York, I was finally in the city. I was with my girlfriend, one of the few people — alongside my parents and a handful of friends — who knew what I was about to do. I wasn’t scheduled to work at my job at a fishing store (where I sell bait and tackle, and keep moored boats topped up with gas) this weekend. For that I’m grateful, because I’m not sure how I’d have explained the situation to my boss otherwise. How do I ask for time off to enter a Timothée Chalamet lookalike contest? I saw the competition flier on the internet a few weeks ago and thought it could be fun. My girlfriend is a huge Chalamet fan, and was excited by the whole idea. So, I registered as a contestant and posted a selfie to the organizers — all that was needed to enter — just as a joke. I wasn’t sure if the Manhattan event was even real or not. But as it became apparent that it was legit, I bought a plane ticket. It didn’t cost much, with transport and a couple of nights stay coming to around $400. After all, this may be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I wasn’t nervous. If anything, I was pumped. I’ve been thinking of moving to New York City for a while — hopefully once I finish studying graphics and multimedia marketing at the State University of New York Canton (SUNY) — so this felt like a good opportunity. I want to do something creative, like making clothes, shooting videos or modeling, so I reasoned that the event could be a good networking opportunity. That’s how people get jobs isn’t it? Through connections? The Chalamet comparisons began earlier this year when I grew out my dark, curly hair. People have joked under Instagram posts that they liked me in “Dune 2.” I get looks from passersby on the street and a work colleague calls me Willy Wonka. Friends make jokes about the likeness, too. But the weirdest moment happened last winter, when I went to Toronto with my girlfriend during the holidays. We were in a mall and saw a “Wonka” pop-up with giant posters and a huge pink “chocolate” tree, just like the one from the movie. I wasn’t standing there long when a guy working at the pop-up ran over to me. “I’ve seen so many people come through here, and you’re the only one who looks like Timothée. You should sign your name next to his!” he said, pointing to Chalamet’s signature on one of the posters. I immediately felt like an imposter. “I can’t sign that,” I told him. Disappointed, he insisted I take a picture in the photo shoot area. Before I could say no, he and his colleagues rushed over holding a Wonka-style coat and snapped a picture. I still have that photo. It’s funny to think I felt awkward posing for that picture, and yet I was traveling to an event where people take hundreds or even thousands more like it. When I got to Washington Square Park in Manhattan on Sunday, half an hour before the contest was due to begin, there were already at least 1,000 people in the crowd. For a while, all I could see were phone screens — people recording me, taking my picture and asking to speak to me. At first it was overwhelming. I felt hounded by the TV cameras and journalists, as if I were an animal in the zoo or a circus. I was scared that contestants would be asked to perform or walk in front of all these people. I heard some boos and cheers at the other end of the park (I later saw online that it was the crowd judging other contestants), but I stayed under the Washington Square Arch. I met a few other lookalikes and we stuck together amid the pandemonium. The NYPD issued a dispersal order and, at one point, an officer approached me and screamed that I needed to leave the park. I ignored him and moved away, but I saw another contestant get handcuffed and dragged out of the area. (The NYPD has since confirmed that it fined organizers $500 for an “unpermitted costume contest,” and at least one contestant was taken away in handcuffs, though a police spokesperson told the Associated Press that charges are pending.) When , the energy intensified. He was gone in a flash, however, disappearing through the crowd and heading back to a car on the outskirts of the park. I think he knew things would have escalated if he’d stayed too long. I had planned my outfit earlier in the week: A gray T-shirt, black leather jacket, ankle boots and straight-leg jeans to make me look skinnier. I was trying to recreate Chalamet’s look from the Chanel perfume campaign he starred in this summer. Some of the other Timothée’s, including the winner, dressed up as Willy Wonka. I didn’t get a good look at him, but I think they gave him the $50 prize (and a trophy) because he committed to the bit by giving out chocolate. I didn’t care about winning, but it was flattering when people later told me I should have taken first place. This will be my one and only lookalike competition. While I loved my three hours of fame (I have to admit, I felt a buzz from being “recognized”) it had its downsides. The stares, people pulling and touching you, photographing you. Luckily for me, as soon as it was over I could go and eat tacos with my girlfriend — no fans crowding the table, no disguises, no sneaky pictures being snapped from across the restaurant. Next week, I’ll go back to school and my job at the fishing store like nothing happened. And as much fun as it was to be Timothée Chalamet for an afternoon, I’m truly glad I’m Reed Putman. “Wonka” is distributed by Warner Bros., which is owned by CNN’s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery.",

    "content": "Is it a bird? Is it a winged goddess? Is it an ode to the history of traditional Dutch ceramics? At Miss Universe 2024, it was all those things — and much more — as the annual pageant kicked off with its flamboyant national costume competition Thursday evening. Tasked with modeling looks that represent their homelands, 126 contestants took the stage at the Arena CDMX in Mexico City ahead of Saturday’s grand finale. And while many looked to folk arts, deities or their nations’ flags for inspiration, others took more outlandish approaches. Miss Nicaragua, Geyssell García, came dressed as her country’s famous León Cathedral. Kenyan beauty queen Irene Mukii’s costume meanwhile featured the faces of several notable athletes, a nod to her in long-distance running. And Miss Chile, Emilia Dides, stepped out wearing a huge roulette wheel as a tribute to popular Chilean TV variety show “Sábado Gigante.” Elsewhere, contestants turned to national flora and fauna, from Miss Bangladesh Aniqa Alam’s tiger-themed costume to the red-eyed elephant protruding from Miss Ivory Coast Marie-Emmanuelle Diamala’s outfit. Miss Myanmar, Thet San Andersen, burst out of a golden owl costume to reveal a pair of sparkling wings, while Great Britain’s Christina Chalk arrived on stage in a foliage-covered outfit inspired by the found in the United Kingdom. Part of the glitzy pageant’s preliminary round, the costume segment was immediately followed by a swimwear contest. The winners of both will be announced on Saturday before the finalists are narrowed down to a shortlist of 30, who will then compete to inherit the Miss Universe crown from reigning titleholder of Nicaragua.",

    "content": "Victoria Kjær Theilvig of Denmark has been crowned Miss Universe 2024, becoming the first Dane to ever win the competition. The 21-year-old, a competitive dancer, entrepreneur, and aspiring lawyer, beat more than 120 other contestants to win the annual beauty pageant in Mexico City on Saturday night. She was applauded by other contestants on stage as she accepted the tiara from reigning titleholder of Nicaragua. This year’s finale featured a performance by singer Robin Thicke and was hosted by “Saved by the Bell” star Mario Lopez and former Miss Universe Olivia Culpo. The glitzy pageant began with contestants being narrowed down to a shortlist of 30, based on the results of Thursday’s preliminary event, which included a . The semi-finalists then paraded in swimwear, before 12 of them advanced to an evening gown contest. The final five contestants later faced questions on a range of topics, including leadership and resilience. When asked how she would live differently if nobody would judge her, Theilvig told the judges she wouldn’t change anything, saying, “I live by each day.” When later asked what she would say to those watching, Theilvig urged viewers to “keep fighting … no matter where you come from.” “I stand here today because I want a change, I want to make history, and that’s what I’m doing tonight,” she said. Chidimma Adetshina of Nigeria finished as first runner-up and Maria Fernanda Beltran of Mexico was named second runner-up. Suchata Chuangsri of Thailand and Ileana Marquez Pedroza of Venezuela followed – with Pedroza, a 28-year-old mother, making history in the top five after the competition removed several restrictions in recent years. This year marked the first time in Miss Universe’s 72-year history that women aged over 28 were permitted to enter. More than two dozen of the finalists were older than would have been allowed in previous years, with Malta’s Beatrice Njoya becoming the first and only woman in her 40s to reach the grand finale. The age limit’s removal came amid growing calls for the pageant to modernize. Ahead of 2023’s contest, the Miss Universe Organization also lifted a longstanding ban on pregnant women or mothers, and women who are — or ever have been — married. Delegates for each country were selected via local pageants that license local rights from the Miss Universe Organization. This year’s contest saw Cuba, represented by Marianela Ancheta, take part in Miss Universe for the first time since 1967. Several countries, including Belarus, Eritrea and the United Arab Emirates, sent contestants for the first time, though in April the Miss Universe Organization moved to a flurry of what it called “false and misleading” reports that Saudi Arabia was due to make its debut in the 2024 pageant. Some national-level contests were marred by controversies in the build-up to this year’s final — including Miss Universe South Africa, which saw Adetshina quit the competition (and later be to represent Nigeria) after questions around her nationality sparked a wave of xenophobic hostility. Last December, the director of the Miss Universe Nicaragua contest, Karen Celebertti, just weeks after Palacios took the crown, amid charges of conspiracy and treason. She, along with her husband and son, were accused of involvement in a plot to overthrow the government. Neither Celebertti nor the Nicaraguan government responded to CNN’s request for comment.",

    "content": "“Demure,” a word that went viral over the summer, has been named Dictionary.com’s 2024 word of the year — beating out other contenders like “brainrot,” “brat,” and “weird.” In an announcement Monday, the site said that the word experienced a “ ” in 2024 — up 1,200% between January and August — a spike that was largely attributed to TikToker and beauty influencer Jools Lebron’s popularization of the phrase “very demure, very mindful” in a series of satirical videos that shook the internet. “You see how I do my makeup for work? Very demure. Very Lebron says in one of her TikToks, donning a slightly pared-down version of her usual makeup of black, winged eyeliner and fake eyelashes. “The way I came to the interview is the way I go to the job. A lot of you girls go to the interview looking like Marge Simpson and go to the job looking like (her sisters) Patty and Selma. Not demure,” she adds, using characters from “The Simpsons” TV show to make her point. “Demure” has historically been used to describe discrete and reserved behavior, but “a new usage has spread through social media,” Dictionary.com said, highlighting the word’s recent associations with a person’s appearance and the way they act at work or in public places. “Every video is me just referencing me,” Lebron says with the playful caption “obscurity of demurity,” where she explains the joke after users wondered if people should be judged on their appearances at work. “That’s the joke!” The satire is clearest in a in which the TikTok star asserts that she’s going to behave in a demure, mindful way while going out on the Las Vegas Strip. Her sober assertions that she’ll be back in bed by 10 p.m. are intercut with scenes of Lebron from later that night, giggling at a club and struggling to find her hotel room. Notable figures like Kim Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez, and “Drag Race” host RuPaul have all taken advantage of the trend to promote their brands. In photos from a recent campaign for her shapewear brand Skims, Kardashian used the phrase in the : “See how I take my bts pictures…very cutsie (sic), very mindful, very demure…not like the other girls” Taking to Instagram, Jennifer Lopez captioned a post Delola with the caption “very demure…very mindful,” along with a video of her elegantly sipping. “See how I’m reading this book? Very demure. I don’t dog-ear pages, I put in a bookmark,” RuPaul said in a promoting online bookstore Allstora. “And I don’t divulge the ending to my friends. Very considerate. And also, my cell phone is on do-not-disturb. Very demure. Very mindful.” Lebron also appeared in a with makeup artist Patrick Ta, who was promoting a new skin foundation from his beauty line. Lebron, who is transgender, said that the fame from her “demure” videos has helped her . “I used to be crazy and out of control and then I found some demurity, and along with that came success,” she said, on . She has now amassed more than 2.3 million followers on TikTok. Dictionary.com said that its decision to choose “demure” this year was informed by a deep analysis of social media trends, news headlines and words that transcended conversations online, seeping into everyday dialogue. The site’s word of the year in 2023 was “ ” — a reference to the rise of chatbots and artificial intelligence that can often spur misinformation. “Brat,” another word that has taken on new meaning in 2024, was named Collins Dictionary’s word of 2024 for being one of the most .",

    "content": "In German folklore, doppelgängers are considered to be a bad omen whose presence brings about misfortune. It feels all the more fitting then, that amid today’s geopolitical conflicts, increasing climate catastrophes and economic uncertainties, we’re seemingly hooked on celebrity lookalike contests. It began with actor Timothée Chalamet. In October, hundreds of onlookers turned up at Washington Square Park to watch more than a dozen chocolate-haired 20-somethings jostle for the title of Chalamet’s unofficial doppelgänger. The event, organized by YouTuber Anthony Po, ended in a handful of arrests, a $500 fine and an appearance from the Oscar-nominated actor himself. “It was insane,” Reed Putman, a Chalamet lookalike contestant, . “People were flooding (around you) recording you and taking photos or asking quick questions.” After that, things moved quickly. In Ireland, mulleted men , hoping to have their likeness to Paul Mescal verified by a jumbo cheque for €20 ($21) (a second contest took place at a pub in London, apparently making Mescal the first actor to inspire two competitions). Days later, more young men, this time dressed in pussy-bow blouses and three-strand pearls, piled into London’s Soho Square looking to be crowned the best Harry Styles lookalike. Then there was the search for actor Dev Patel’s doppelgänger in San Francisco, and singer Zayn Malik’s in New York. And not since the taping of a “Top Chef” episode has so many apron-wearing men gathered in one place for the Jeremy Allen White competition in Chicago earlier this month. There were cigarettes, and yards of fake tattoos — all in reference to paparazzi shots of White as well as his character Carmy Berzatto in “The Bear.” Just this past week, Zendaya — because who else? — became what appears to be the first female celebrity to have her own viral lookalike contest in Oakland, California while one for actor Glen Powell was held over the weekend in Austin, Texas. Thanks to social media a new competition poster seems to go viral each week, with many awarding a small cash prize and an item associated with the celebrity or celebrity’s character (White’s lookalike took home a pack of Marlboro Reds, while the organizers of Zendaya’s contest threw in a bottle of shampoo and conditioner of a brand that the actor reportedly uses). Like a dog whistle for a particular type of online Gen Z or Millennial, these contests spread like wildfire. But the idea of a lookalike contest is in fact a time-honored form of entertainment. In his memoir, Charlie Chaplin Jr. wrote that his famous father had not only entered but came third in his own lookalike competition — held at Grauman’s Chinese Theater in Hollywood sometime between 1915 and 1921. (Dolly Parton said she also participated in one held of her, at a gay bar in Santa Monica decades later. She lost). There were Shirley Temple contests in the 1930s — including one in Sydney, Australia in 1934 and one in 1935 at the Cleveland Food Show, where more than 900 children entered. The event was so popular, the Cleveland organizers reportedly staged three more — one for femme fatale Myrna Loy, one for singer Alice Faye and one for actor Katharine Hepburn. For the last 40 years, a bar in Key West, Florida has been staging an annual Ernest Hemmingway lookalike competition. But British sociologist and celebrity cultural critic Ellis Cashmore believes there’s a reason we’re seeing a resurgence of these types of contests now. “I don’t think this is a vestige of the Golden Age of Hollywood,” he told CNN over the phone. “I think (the most recent ones) capture something that we believe in the 21st century… That biology isn’t destiny.” To Cashmore, our current society is defined by the idea that “you can potentially do anything and be anything you want to be.” “What (the audience) is looking at is a transition in process,” he said. “They know this isn’t really Harry Styles on stage, but if someone who looks so much like him, could even be him, you’re giving someone an indication of just how malleable and changeable we are as human beings. Humanity isn’t fixed.” There’s a chance to build a real community, too, he says. “These lookalike contests provide us with an opportunity to relate and form new relationships with people we might hitherto not know and would never cross paths with and wouldn’t even say hello to them in a gym, in a club, in a bar, in a supermarket or anywhere,” Cashmore added. “But the fact is, they share a common interest, and that is celebrity.” Andy Harmer, professional David Beckham tribute act and founder of Lookalikes, one of the UK’s top celebrity impersonator agencies, believes it’s more to do with the fact that “humans are interested in all kinds of symmetry.” Harmer, who is writing a book on the history of his unique industry, recounts examples of lookalikes in nature: “Stick insects use (similarity) to survive. And some flowers look like bees,” he told CNN in a phone interview, referring to the bee orchid which mimics the appearance of a female bee to encourage pollination. “It’s a natural thing,” he said. His career as Beckham’s double hasn’t always been smooth sailing, however. “When he (Beckham) got sent off against Argentina (during the 1998 World Cup) everybody knew him, but everybody hated him,” Harmer said. “Me and Victoria used to get so much abuse, death threats and stuff,” he said, referring to a friend of his who looked like Victoria Beckham. “It was crazy.” According to the 2020 Channel 4 documentary, “The World’s Most Identical Strangers.” it’s estimated that one face will have at least seven doppelgänger matches. But Dr. Manel Esteller, the chairman of genetics at the University of Barcelona’s School of Medicine, points out that doppelgänger is a relative term. “The perfect ones are the real ones, the monozygotic twins (split from the same embryo) with over 90% similarity,” he said over email. “From that point on you can look 85%, 80%, 75% similar to someone. The cut-off point (75% similarity) determines the number of so-called “virtual twins” in the world.” In 2022, in the scientific journal Cell Reports found that lookalikes with no family connection shared genetic variants. If you are genetically blessed with a striking celebrity resemblance, Harmer assures it can become a lucrative career. He has supported himself as Beckham’s dead-ringer for 20 years, working with the man himself on ads and even appearing in the 2002 film “Bend it like Beckham.” The star of his agency is Denise Ohnona, a Lancashire-born Kate Moss lookalike who has walked the runway for Marine Serre and Vetements at Paris Fashion Week. “She’s been very popular this year,” he said. “A lot of brands are realizing that lookalikes are actually great… It’s quite cost effective. You’re not paying for the amount you would pay for the real one.” But is there a psychological impact of having your identity so tightly bound to someone else? There doesn’t have to be, Harmer says. “Treat it like fancy dress,” he advises. “And don’t get too wrapped up in it.” And for the latest cohort of victorious lookalikes, Harmer does have one more piece of wisdom: “Contact me, because I can turn your looks into money.”",

    "content": "The internet isn’t as nice a place as it used to be. On social media, , and algorithm-enhanced maleficence are increasingly commonplace. Like many people who once looked to Twitter for community, my online circles have been depleted and my feeds hijacked by the self-indulgent thread-makers and self-appointed blue-tick influencers of Elon Musk-era X. Yet, there are still friendly, welcoming corners of the internet. And I have found mine. Reddit’s is a 143,000-strong community (comprised mostly of, presumably, bald men) offering advice, support and encouragement to those who’ve taken, or are considering taking, “the plunge” by shaving off their thinning hair. With the strapline “lose your hair, not your head,” it is the antithesis of toxic masculinity — a place where men share their vulnerabilities and are actively nice to one another. Founded in 2011, this refuge for the follicly challenged is now among Reddit’s 2% most popular forums (or “subreddits”) and attracts upwards of a dozen posts a day. There are two ways in which these typically unfold. The first sees men uploading photos of their desperate hairlines and receiving a friendly but necessary reality check. “Is it over for me?” reads one recent entry. “Is it time, brothers?” “Should I bite the bullet?” “Time to let go?” others ask. The answer is, almost invariably, yes. But the bad news is delivered with warmth and empathy by those — — who also clung on longer than they should have. The second type of post sees people unveiling their freshly shaved bald heads, sometimes preceded by photos of their erstwhile hairlines or conspicuous comb-overs. What follows is a flood of whatever the opposite of cyber-bullying is (cyber-camaraderie?), whereby users say which handsome celebrity the original poster — or OP, in Reddit-speak — resembles and how much better they look. And guess what? They, almost invariably, do. As late fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld famously observed: “Nothing makes you look older than attempting to look young.” The most-liked in r/bald’s 13-year history is a case in point. Titled “I gave in today,” it is accompanied by a series of correspondingly despondent “before” photos. The final slide, however, reveals a man transformed. “If there was a top 10 of bald glow ups, you’d be in there somewhere,” reads one of the 13,000 replies. “Bro you look utterly reborn,” wrote another user. While I can’t speak for the subreddit’s thousands of commenters, I’m sure many are motivated by their own experience of male pattern baldness. I certainly wish I’d known about r/bald as I clung to the last remnants of my own hair. Balding can be a strangely isolating process. It is a glaring reminder of our mortality coupled with more prosaic concerns about becoming less attractive, having a weird-shaped head and looking like every other hairless guy. Friends and loved ones may tell us how great we’d look bald but, sadly, we often care more about what strangers (rather than people whose opinions really matter) think of us. And what better balm for your insecurities than having thousands of anonymous internet users call you a hunk? There is, of course, lots of other head-related chatter on r/bald. Do you wear a hat in bed? Should you moisturize your scalp? Beard or no beard? Occasionally, someone with a few years’ worth of remaining hair posts a photo, and users recommend a shorter trim as a — albeit short-term — solution. More rarely still, someone whose anxiety has clearly got the better of them posts a photo showing, to all intents and purposes, a full head of hair. Yet, rather than decry their delusion, r/bald’s envious users will remind OP of his luck, tell him how glorious his mane is and send him on his way. After all, as one of the forum’s rules reads: “Treat the hair-headed ones with kindness too.” The forum’s other directives speak to a culture of understanding. “No bald-bashing,” reads one. Also outlawed: advocating hair-restoration methods (we leave that to the folk over at r/HairTransplants and r/HairlossProgressPics) and trash-talking, which includes, moderators write, referring to someone with a full head of hair as having “superior genetics.” And it’s not just r/bald. Many of Reddit’s other personal style forums serve up a healthy mix of positive validation and constructive criticism. On the 271,000-member , users praise or politely critique one another’s “fit checks”; the 6.5-million-strong rates users’ beauty regimes and hosts weekly makeup contests. These communities, like all subreddits, are largely self-policed by user-moderators who are invested in the topic at hand. The community’s opinion matters, too: “Upvoted” comments rise to the top of the discussion, while responses that are widely “downvoted,” either for being mean-spirited or inaccurate, sink from view. There are other ways in which the platform’s design encourages courteous behavior among bald men and beyond. Users achieve good “karma” scores by being consistently upvoted, meaning that status is acquired by making valuable contributions, not by provoking outrage. Tiny profile pictures meanwhile deflate egos, as does the difficulty of going “viral” beyond a circle of people interested in a particular subject. There are no Reddit celebrities here. The result is, often, more informed and informative conversation than is found on other social media platforms. While X continues to hemorrhage users (and ) following the Musk takeover, Reddit — long a minnow among social media behemoths — appears to be flourishing. The platform averaged 97.2 million daily active users in the last quarter, a year-on-year . In fact, switching X for Reddit in my online diet was perhaps the best decision I’ve made this year — not just for the stream of body-positivity that now fills my feed each day, but for my renewed faith in human civility. And yes, you would probably look better bald.",

    "title": "\n      Why Nefertiti still inspires, 3,300 years after she reigned\n    ",
    "author": "CNN",
    "publication_date": "2024-12-27T00:52:21.263Z",
    "cate": "style",
    "content": "One hundred years ago, in a courtyard at the Neues Museum in Berlin, the world came face to face for the first time with one of its most enduring beauty icons: Queen Nefertiti. Discovered in Egypt in 1912 by German archaeologists, her 3,300-year-old stucco-coated limestone bust went on display in 1924. Its unveiling stunned audiences from Cairo to London and sparked a century-long fascination with her aesthetic. The artifact’s sharply defined features — her chiseled jawline, high cheekbones, ‘swan-like’ neck, and kohl-rimmed eyes — have, for decades, served as a reference point across fashion and the arts. In the bust, Nefertiti is seen wearing a wide collar and a flat-topped crown with a golden band and uraeus (a headdress featuring a sacred serpent), decorated in greens, yellows, browns and blues. Research indicates that she was a royal and noblewoman who reportedly bore six daughters, one of whom is said to have married Tutankhamun, but little else is known about Nefertiti’s life and origins. Egypt in the 14th century BC was not ethnically or racially homogeneous, and many scholars surmise that, based on her depictions and the region’s population, Nefertiti would be considered a woman of color in today’s terms. “Nefertiti’s bust is so perfect; she’s so self-possessed,” Dr. Cheryl Finley, a professor of art history at Spelman College in Atlanta, told CNN “That’s what really grabs the attention and imagination. It’s her confidence, and her gaze, of course. It’s something that attracts us all.” Following the bust’s discovery in the 1920s, Nefertiti quickly became an “it” girl. The meaning of her name, ‘the beautiful one has arrived,’ proved particularly apt, as her face was plastered across advertisements for kohl, and her likeness appeared in beauty columns. Designers of the time, such as the French couturier Paul Poiret, incorporated Egyptian motifs into their work. In 1945, American milliner Lilly Daché designed hats with a distinct Nefertiti flair. By 1961, Vogue had published an article exploring the world’s ongoing “fascination” with the queen. Elizabeth Taylor’s portrayal of Cleopatra in 1963 further cemented this obsession, making the “Egyptian look” a staple in fashion circles. Nefertiti’s style continued to influence fashion decades after the bust’s discovery. In Dior’s Spring 2004 show, John Galliano showcased looks that included tall Nefertiti hats. In 2015, Christian Louboutin launched a lipstick collection that drew inspiration from the royal wife, featuring gold-and-black vials adorned with crowns. (Nefertiti likely used the natural clay earth pigment red ochre for her lips). Jewelry designers like Azza Fahmy have evoked her in their pieces, while Azzedine Alaïa’s Fall 2017 line paid tribute with black turbans, one of which was famously worn by supermodel Naomi Campbell. In the modern day, Nefertiti’s significance as a cultural icon remains strong. On TikTok and Instagram, influencers recreate the queen’s looks in tutorials. Her likeness inspires items as varied as mass-produced T-shirts and mugs to and high-end perfumes. In the beauty industry, Black and brown-owned brands like Juvia’s Place and UOMA Beauty have marketed makeup that pays homage to Nefertiti. Even plastic surgeons name-drop her with the “Nefertiti Lift”— a non-invasive cosmetic technique that uses Botox to enhance the jawline. “Nefertiti’s bust… transcends time,” explained Finley. “It also enables people to draw their own power from it.” But the story of how the bust of Nefertiti found its way to Berlin in the first place is mired in controversy. After being transported to Europe in 1913, one year after its discovery in Egypt, the piece was hidden from public view for over a decade. In 1924, to much fanfare, it was put on display at the Neues Museum, where it still remains, spurring an ongoing debate about its rightful resting place (a led by Egyptologist Zahi Hawass has reignited calls for its repatriation, saying that its removal from the country was “unjustified” and against “the spirit of Egyptian laws”.) When the bust was first unveiled, White Western women sought to emulate Nefertiti’s look. A 1933 New York Times article encouraged women to recreate her angular features — albeit without darkening the skin, echoing structural imbalances in the beauty industry, which fetishized non-European aesthetics yet discouraged and discriminated against darker skin tones. Women began to fashion their looks after Nefertiti’s style, lining their eyes like her cat-eye, wearing tops that imitated the era’s collars, and donning tall hats or styling their hair high to resemble her crown. Replicas of the bust even appeared in American hair salons, promising the allure of her ‘exotic’ beauty. “And why wouldn’t you want to look like her?” said Dr. Elka Stevens, an associate professor of visual culture and studio art at Howard University in Washington, D.C. “Take the crown off, drop her in any society, and she can fit in. ” Nefertiti may have been more palatable to European audiences as some of the bust’s features align well with Western aesthetic preferences, explained Professor Charmaine A. Nelson of the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The queen, she noted, defied “so much of the history of the Western perception of Black women and women of color, (which) is as ‘other,’ as ‘grotesque,’ as ‘unaesthetic body,’” said Nelson, who teaches Black diasporic art and art history. “It’s really striking and probably works in the favor of the White gaze that her hair is covered,” she added, suggesting that textured hair, particularly Afro-textured styles, have historically challenged Eurocentric beauty standards. In some ways, Nefertiti tells us more about ourselves than she does about her. Although she is one of ancient history’s most recognizable figures, much of her life remains a mystery — a gap that allows her persona to be molded into whatever icon society needs at any given time. As the wife of Pharaoh Akhenaten, Nefertiti played a major role in Egyptian politics. Together, the pair led a religious revolution by abandoning polytheism and promoting worship of the sun god Aten. Nefertiti was often portrayed with her husband in elaborate attire, suggesting her fashion was tied to her political grativas. But into Akhenaten’s reign, she vanished from historical records, leading to endless theories about her fate — was she forced into exile, did she fall ill, or was she murdered? Some speculate that she may have even assumed a new identity as a . Nefertiti’s legacy has been whitewashed in various ways; a 2018 3D reconstruction, for example, sparked backlash for its lighter skin tone. Such efforts reflect attempts to whiten Egypt and to “make claim to it as closer to Europe than to (Black) Africa,” Nelson notes. Meanwhile, in Black culture, Nefertiti has been embraced as a symbol of power, with contemporary figures like Beyoncé and Rihanna drawing from her image. Rihanna, who has a tattoo of Nefertiti’s bust on her ribcage, paid homage to her in a Beyoncé channeled Nefertiti in her 2016 “Sorry” music video, styling her hair to mimic the crown and posing like the artwork. The singer’s Coachella performance in 2018 featured a Balmain-designed cape adorned with Nefertiti’s resemblance. At the height of her career, Erykah Badu wrapped her locs in the shape of the queen’s headdress; Aretha Franklin also wore “Nefertiti head wraps”. More recently, English singer FKA Twigs flaunted a half-shaved head and faux locs, mirroring Nefertiti’s crown and, at the 2024 Met Gala, Imaan Hammam’s makeup artist gave the Dutch supermodel exaggerated eyeliner, also honoring the ancient queen. The royal consort’s memory goes far beyond trends — it helps shape how people see themselves, said Stevens. “It changes the way we engage with one another when we know there’s this shared history.” Perhaps most important is that for many, Nefertiti’s image is deeply personal. “I see my family when I look at her, and I can see your family,” says Stevens. For this reason, “we’re going to be regaled with tales of her beauty until the end of time. She’s not going anywhere — she’s going to live through each of us, and that’s the most exciting thing.”",

It states: “After years of history full of glamor, talent and inspiration, Miss Netherlands is saying goodbye to the name that found itself in many people’s hearts. But this is not the end; it is a new beginning. The world is changing, and we are changing with it. “Miss Netherlands is transforming into : a platform that revolves around mental health, social media, diversity, self-expression and much more. No more crowns, but stories that connect. No dresses, but dreams that come to life. “Here we inspire young people to be themselves in a world that is constantly changing.” In a statement sent to CNN, Monica van Ee, director of Miss Netherlands and founder of the new platform, said: “Women are insecure due to, among other things, the rise of social media and its unreal images of beauty.” Defending the contest’s record to date, she said her team had “worked intensively with participants” over the years, and that the e﻿mpowerment of women was not just “empty words but a movement.” The viewer feedback has become increasingly difficult to manage, however. Van Ee said the reason for dropping the “castings and finals” initially arose from “the obstinacy of the spectator” and criticisms like “she is too White” or “she is too Black.” “This leads to negative energy every year,” she said. “Secondly, we would like to use our positive energy instead of always having to get defensive. Now we can reach everyone and provide the right solidarity. We believe in our platform and perhaps a sash and a crown are outdated. But women who support each other and help each other, that has always been important to us!” Kollé, who was one of two trans women who went on to compete in Miss Universe 2023, used her influence to promote a more inclusive vision of the pageant world. In a video posted to Instagram last year, she said: “Miss Universe asked us to describe ourselves in one word. “The word I’m choosing is ‘victory,’ because as a little boy I conquered all the things that came through my path — and look at me now, standing here as a strong, empowering and confident trans woman.” The beauty pageant world has been forced to modernize in recent years, as the values the shows traditionally embraced do not chime with younger generations. This year’s Miss Universe, held in Mexico City last month, admitted women aged over 28 for the first time ever. It followed moves last year to lift the ban on including pregnant women or mothers, and women who are — or have ever been — married. That rule still stands in some pageants, however. Back in September, a New York woman submitted a complaint to the city’s Commission on Human Rights seeking an end to the exclusion of mothers. The Miss Universe organization came under scrutiny earlier this year as the  parent company of Miss USA. In May, Miss USA and Miss Teen USA resigned within days of one another amid allegations of mismanagement, toxicity and conditions that impacted their mental health.

    "content": "A new Miss America has been crowned: Abbie Stockard, a 22-year-old Auburn University nursing student and cheerleader who was named Miss Alabama last June ahead of her senior year. Stockard triumphed over 51 other hopefuls — one from each US state, as well as Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico — at the annual pageant in Orlando, Florida on Sunday. Annette Addo-Yobo, the first foreign-born delegate to win Miss Texas, was named runner up, with representatives from Tennessee, Florida and Ohio completing the top five. The pageant began with contestants taking the stage in glittering gold mini dresses and black sashes before they were swiftly narrowed down to 11 finalists based on the results of preliminary events earlier in the week. Over the course of the evening, finalists vying for the crown (and a $50,000 prize) came together for choreographed dance performances and competed in several live segments judged by former Olympic athlete Carl Lewis and cheerleader Gabi Butler of Netflix’s “Cheer,” among others. The event included a fitness portion, which replaced swimwear in 2023, and saw contestants parade in red-and-gold athleisure two-pieces, as well as talent, eveningwear and interview rounds. Talent performances included slam poetry (Miss Texas), clogging (Miss Oklahoma) and a jazz dance routine to Lesley Gore’s 1963 hit “You Don’t Own Me” (Miss Wisconsin). Stockard performed a contemporary dance to a song by Christian musician Lauren Daigle, then took the stage in a backless, glittering silver and white gown for her eveningwear look. Elsewhere in the pageant, delegates answered questions on randomly assigned topics such as housing, censorship and the national debt. Stockard, when asked to comment on unemployment, spoke to the declining labor force participation rate among 25-to-54-year-olds following the Covid-19 pandemic (though the employment rate for that demographic has ). “I believe we need to encourage those (people) to join the workforce, adapt to new skills and learn to grow in our current workforce and industries we have today,” she said. Addo-Yobo, meanwhile, was asked about the topic of immigration. She spoke to her personal experiences of becoming a US citizen two years prior, telling the judges that her parents arrived in the country with “two suitcases, a few hundred dollars and a little girl, which was me, in a fur coat.” In a video broadcast during the pageant, Stockard said she had been inspired by her mother, who she said worked multiple jobs, and her best friend, who has cystic fibrosis and was in attendance Sunday night (Stockard’s charity initiative for the pageant raised money for cystic fibrosis research). A video posted to Miss America’s official Instagram account on Sunday evening showed Stockard reacting to her victory, saying: “This is insane. I don’t know what I did to deserve this.” Founded in 1921, Miss America began in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and enjoyed a decades-long heyday as a televised event on major networks NBC and ABC before its . NBC’s streaming service Peacock aired the competition in 2022, but since then it has only been available on pageant-specific streaming platforms. Last year’s crown went to , a 22-year-old second lieutenant in the US Air Force, who made history as the first active-duty military member to win the national title. Following her win, Marsh she felt like she “broke stereotypes in pageants and in the military for women all across the globe.” She has served as an ambassador for the Miss America Organization for the past year, before passing on the torch. The pageant also features a teen competition, with Peyton Bolling of Arkansas crowned Miss America Teen on Saturday night. Contestants for Miss America Teen must be aged between 14 and 18 years old, while Miss America ranges from 18 to 28 years old. Miss America increased its maximum age from 25 to 28 in 2023, though other pageant organizations have more significantly loosened their eligibility criteria in recent years. The Miss Universe Organization, which runs Miss USA (a separate pageant from Miss America), eliminated its upper age limit altogether last year, leading to the likes of 80-year-old and 71-year-old competing in Miss Universe Korea and Miss Texas USA, respectively. In September, a New York mom against the Miss America Organization and Miss World Organization for their respective rules disqualifying mothers from their competitions. Miss America has also been at the center of an ongoing ownership dispute between estranged business partners Robin Fleming and Glenn Straub, according to .",

    "content": "In idyllic settings around India’s coastal southwestern state of Kerala, photographer Keerthana Kunnath has been capturing images of muscular women flexing their heroic forms. Amid foaming waves, palm fronds or rocky outcrops the women curl biceps, tense quads or exaggerate shoulders, exchanging gym clothes for a gauzy olive dress or feminine checkered bikini top and skirt. But in Kerala, where the London-based photographer is from, bodybuilding is still taboo for women, who are typically expected to adhere to traditional, feminine norms. After stumbling upon one competitor’s Instagram account, Kunnath became fascinated by the female bodybuilders who have dedicated their time to the sport and defied societal conventions — and often their family’s wishes, too. “Where we are, it’s not a very common thing,” she explained in a phone call to CNN. “I would barely call it a ‘community’ because it’s still fairly new, and there’s only a very handful of girls who are into it.” Across India, a growing number of female competitors in the sport have achieved professional status with its governing body, the International Fitness and Bodybuilding Federation — but only in recent years. Deepika Chowdury, a former molecular biologist, became the first Indian woman to do so in 2016. Initially interested in researching the gender-neutral martial art Kalaripayattu, which originated in Kerala, Kunnath shifted her focus after finding that the women focused on bulking instead. The bodybuilders she photographed — part of her series “Not What You Saw” — didn’t know each other well, but were aware of one another through social media and competitions. “Every time I connected with each person, and I told them I’m going to photograph that person before you, they would be like, ‘Oh my god, I know her — her body is stunning. Her thighs are crazy,’” she said with a laugh. “It felt like mutual admiration between all of them.” For Bhumika Kumar, who is 22 years old and lives in the Kerala city of Kochi, training for bodybuilding competitions has fulfilled a lifelong desire to become an athlete — a dream she hadn’t been allowed to pursue as a child, she told CNN via WhatsApp. Now a gold-medalist in local competitions like Miss Kerala and Miss Ernakulam, she has transformed herself following what she described as an inactive childhood. “My parents wouldn’t let me go out and play with other kids. Hence, I was not a very physically active kid during my school days. I was always low in stamina and strength,” she wrote. As an adult, she found her gateway to exercise through workout videos on YouTube and joined a gym “after lots of fights with family,” she said. She felt drawn to competing professionally but also divided on whether to pursue it until a year ago. “I couldn’t stop thinking about stepping onstage,” she said. “Then I finally decided to go for it and met my coach.” Kumar isn’t the only woman in the series whose relatives felt entitled to get involved with their personal choices. Kunnath spoke extensively with each of her subjects by phone before meeting them in person to better understand their journeys. “A lot of them had pressure from their family and extended relatives: ‘How are you letting your daughter go into this space where they’re working on their muscles? They’re showing off their bodies,’” she said, recalling the kinds of comments her subjects had heard. Kerala’s female bodybuilders are entering a high-pressure, male-dominated sport requiring daily commitment under coaches primarily used to training men. One of Kunnath’s subjects, 25-year-old Sandra A S, has been training for four years and now coaches aspiring bodybuilders, too. She hopes to break barriers for women competitors by winning a qualification card to compete professionally on the international stage. As Kunnath visualized the series, she turned to the iconography of Indian goddesses that she encountered during childhood. “I still remember having these posters of goddesses in front of these serene backgrounds,” she recalled. Working with a local stylist, , Kunnath pursued non-sexualized, heroic portraits with muted pastels and flowing fabrics, departing from gym clothes or the punchy, colorful bathing suits and direct lighting of the bodybuilding stage. “They are these extremely muscular, strong, confident girls… but still, they still have this softness to them,” Kunnath said. The photographer found the more a bodybuilder bulks, the more she is treated as a “really strong, intimidating character,” but that’s not always the case. Since beginning the series, Kunnath has also made a point of supporting her subjects by attending their competitions and taking their professional headshots to a “thank you” for being part of the work. “They had to carve this space for themselves,” she said. “I feel like those stories should be celebrated.”",

    "content": "Hollywood star has revealed that the prosthetics she wore in the critically-acclaimed horror movie caused so much damage to her skin that it took about a year to recover. “At the end, when they’re shooting up my skirt in the beginning credits, when it’s like the palm trees all around and they have all these long lenses from the bottom, that’s just because my face was so f**ked up by that time,” told Josh Horowitz on the podcast “Happy Sad Confused.” “They couldn’t shoot my face anymore,” she said in the episode, released Monday. Qualley added that the prosthetics caused acne which lasted even as she was shooting her next movie “Kinds of Kindness.” “So, you know the character that has all that acne? That was just my acne from the prosthetics,” Qualley said. “And I was like, ‘Oh this is actually kind of perfect. I’m playing all these different characters. For one of them, we’ll use all my crazy prosthetic acne.’ Yeah, it took me probably a year to recover physically from all of it.” By making extensive use of prosthetics and other practical effects, “The Substance” depicts the story of celebrated actress and fitness guru Elisabeth Sparkle, played by Demi Moore, who is fired by her boss on her 50th birthday. She learns of a black market drug known as the Substance, which promises to deliver her a younger version of herself named Sue, played by Qualley, with certain caveats. The movie falls into the body-horror genre so Sue gruesomely emerges out of a slit in Elisabeth’s spine and, as their relationship becomes more and more destructive, both their bodies decay in a parable about the pitfalls of chasing eternal youth. Without giving too much away, it all culminates in a final act that brings new meaning to the term “bloodbath.” Towards the end of the movie, Qualley donned a prosthetic suit that she described as “a torture chamber” “We would just go until I had a panic attack,” she said. “And the tempting thing is you want to peel it off, but of course you can’t do that, because you’ll bring your skin with you.” The prosthetics could take “anywhere from six to nine and a half hours,” Moore told Access Hollywood at the Golden Globe Awards. She added that it took “at least an hour and a half to get it all off.” The movie, which is the second feature from French writer-director Coralie Fargeat, has become a critical and commercial success, and entered the cultural zeitgeist. Moore and Qualley’s performances in particular are receiving much awards buzz, with Moore picking up a Golden Globe for best performance by a female actor in a musical or comedy motion picture.",

    "content": "“You don’t need Botox, you don’t!” stated Kirti Tewani in a video posted on TikTok, where she has over 475,400 followers. One might have expected words of empowerment and self-acceptance to follow, but instead, the Ayuverdic therapist and makeup artist started rubbing the inside of a banana peel across her face. “It’s a wrinkle reducer,” Tewani continued to explain, noting that the peels contain lutein, an antioxidant that “can brighten, hydrate and soothe your skin.” When selecting bananas, “the riper, the better,” she advised. To date, has amassed over 2.2 million views and more than 61,200 likes. Tewani, who is based in New York, dislikes the taste of bananas, although her children enjoy and eat them frequently, she told CNN over a phone call. “I was reading about bananas and how they’re rich in potassium and the peel has many nutrients inside. I wondered if it could help to hydrate the skin,” she explained. “When I looked it up online, I saw that a few people were already doing it, so I started experimenting on my face every time my kids ate a banana,” said Tewani. After a month of trials, she noticed that her “smile lines were a little bit more plump and fuller, even though I hadn’t changed too much in my skincare routine. That was really amazing to see.” Tewani is not alone in finding alternative methods to improve the appearance of her skin. Many other beauty enthusiasts have also recently turned to ingredients you’d usually find in the food aisle, such as yogurt, flaxseed and even beef tallow, as a way to hydrate the skin and reduce acne. Rather than ingest the items, they’re rubbing them directly onto their faces — marking a trend that has since been coined on social media as “nature’s Botox.” It’s a surprising development following the pandemic-induced skincare boom, where people spent heavily on science-backed moisturizers, toners and serums from high-end brands including Augustinus Bader, Dr. Barbara Sturm and La Mer, and the rise of tween girls (typically between 8 and 12 years old) such as Sephora, as they shop for buzzy skincare labels like Drunk Elephant, Sol de Janeiro and Glow Recipe. It’s also a trend that’s expected to continue picking up steam: a spokesperson from TikTok told CNN that, as of February, there are over 5,000 videos on the platform with the accompanying hashtag #NaturesBotox, a majority of which were shared over the past two months. So prevalent is the trend that common pantry foods, such as rice, have become in beauty brands’ products. Clare Hennigan, principal analyst for beauty and personal care at global research firm Mintel, believes the shift is indicative of a growing interest in do-it-yourself (DIY) treatments over professional beauty services. Part of that is driven by cost — 77% of US individuals aged 12 to 17 said they enjoyed experimenting with new beauty or skincare trends, but 33% noted that their parents or guardians stopped them from buying something they wanted because it was too expensive, according to 2024 data from Mintel. “A large part of what fuels this is social media,” Hennigan explained to CNN over a call. “With DIY alternatives, there’s this fun that can be had with a community-driven discovery.” For others, it’s less to do with financing and is simply “a lower perceived health and safety risk,” said Hennigan, pointing to facial taping — a non-invasive technique that involves applying a special adhesive tape to the face to tighten skin — as another DIY beauty hack gaining traction. Such treatments are no longer limited to the privacy of at-home routines, either. Doechii wore visible face tape for her performance at the 2025 Grammys, where she was awarded for Best Rap Album. For Tewani, growing up with a holistic approach to beauty, as part of her Indian heritage, meant that using foods beyond simply sustenance was already part of the norm. “A lot of Indians growing up would eat a papaya or cucumber and rub the last piece on their face. Avocados and yogurt are popular as face masks. I’m not scared to use these raw ingredients on my face because I grew up doing that,” she said. Daniela Martinez, a copywriter based in West Palm Beach, Florida, was also influenced by her upbringing. “I grew up with my mom, who is a beauty guru and loves natural remedies,” she said. It led Martinez to look for “simple and natural ways” to improve her skin’s hydration and texture — a journey that she now shares on with her 13,300 followers. Martinez began incorporating flaxseed into her skincare routine after seeing videos from other young women praising the benefits of the seeds. Once or twice a week, she measures two cups of flaxseeds and boils them in water for about five minutes. Some people prefer to set the boiled seeds aside to cool down, Martinez noted, but she prefers to strain them immediately, using a cheesecloth. She’d then apply the seeds to her face and leave it on for about half an hour before rinsing it off. The results, Martinez found, were impressive. “The tightening effect of the mask is absolutely insane,” she said. “My skin was more radiant and felt softer and smoother.” Some skin experts are unconvinced, however, warning that the efficacy and long-term benefits of many natural-based DIY skincare routines are unsubstantiated. “Flaxseed is a great digestive, high-fiber product that people can consume. People take that and think ‘well, if this is good to eat, then it can be good for the face.’ But there is low scientific evidence that flaxseed, beef fat or any of (these foods) are great moisturizers,” Muneeb Shah, a US-based dermatologist, who is certified in dermatology and micrographic surgery by the American Board of Dermatology, told CNN. Much to Shah’s chagrin, Botox has become overused as a descriptor in beauty, because of the recognition it commands. “Every few months I see a new trend online where people are claiming that something is like Botox, but it’s often unproven. Botox is a well understood product and I think people like to use it like an anchor,” he said. With the exception of retinol or argireline, chemical compounds that now commonly appear in skincare, “there really is no topical product that’s going to get a result anywhere close to what Botox can do,” he said. Dija Ayodele, a UK-based aesthetician and the founder of West Room Aesthetics, a skincare destination for women of color, believes there are hidden dangers to DIY natural remedies. Fruits contain varying levels of acids which could cause issues, such as chemical burns, depending on the sensitivity of a person’s skin, she warned. “If you’re using lemon to lighten the dark marks on your skin and you don’t use sunscreen, you’re opening yourself up to photosensitivity. With all things on social media, a lot of people will be fine, but there’s usually someone who’s more vulnerable and it will cause them a lot of problems.” Los Angeles-based content creator Grace May has also come to a similar conclusion. Driven by a desire for clearer skin, she recently experimented with , though it didn’t yield the results she had hoped for. On the evenings May applied the beef fat to her face, she would eschew her usual moisturizer. “The first time I tried it, I found it really greasy,” she said. “If I didn’t let it sit on my face (for long enough before going to bed), I would also get greasy hair, because my hair sometimes goes into my face.” “I’m not the biggest DIY skincare person but I recently got acne, so if there is a product that is getting popular, I wanted to give it a try,” explained May. Though, ultimately, she has stopped using beef tallow altogether. “It seemed that my pores were just clogged by it, and I got even more pimples, so I did not want to continue after that,” she said. Shah, who has undertaken several studies examining various natural oils, including sunflower, olive and coconut, and their effectiveness in repairing or moisturizing the skin barrier, has an explanation: oils with higher oleic levels, such as those from beef tallow, tend to have a higher possibility of causing skin irritation, he warned. But, as with all routines, what works for one person might not necessarily for another, caveats May, noting that she wasn’t too disappointed by her beef tallow facials. “I was already prepared it might not work because I have hormonal acne, which is different from regular acne.” Still on a mission to reduce her acne, May’s new priority is gut health. “I’m eating cleaner now and using gentler products for my face,” she said.",

    "content": ", the treasured Gothic gem in Paris that went up in flames in 2019, will officially reopen Saturday. Immediately after the fire, French President Emmanuel Macron made the ambitious pledge to restore the church within five years. On Friday, he praised hundreds of artisans, carpenters and other specialists for helping him “keep this promise” during his final site visit. “You did it. And it’s an immense source of pride for the entire nation. I’m infinitely grateful to you, France is infinitely grateful to you,” Macron said. Here’s everything you need to know about the days ahead. On April 15, 2019, Notre Dame was engulfed in flames. The cause of the blaze remains a mystery. Investigators say it was likely an accident – perhaps a burning cigarette or an electrical malfunction. France – and much of the world – despaired as the 860-year-old cathedral’s roof caved in, strewing the stone floor below with soot. Macron called it a “terrible tragedy,” and pledged to rebuild the landmark church “because it is what our history deserves.” Some of the country’s richest businessmen pledged hundreds of millions of euros towards the restoration. After more than 2,000 days’ work – involving 2,000 people, 2,000 oak trees and 2,000 features restored or rebuilt – the world got its first glimpse of “Our Lady of Paris” last week, as the French president toured the restored landmark with his wife, Brigitte, and a cluster of clergymen. The official reopening begins with a ceremony on Saturday, followed by eight days of special masses and prayers. The guest list will be long and illustrious, but the most notable attendee will be Donald Trump. The US president-elect he will travel to Paris – his first overseas trip since last month’s election – for what will be “a very special day for all.” The ceremony is expected to draw some 50 heads of state and government. One noteworthy absentee, however, will be Pope Francis. The pontiff will travel to the French Mediterranean island of Corsica on December 15, just days after the reopening, but is skipping a visit to the capital. A leading French archbishop said the “star” of the ceremony ought to be Notre Dame itself, and that the pope did not want to distract from the occasion. Some 170 bishops from France and around the world will also be involved in the ceremony, along with one priest from each of the 106 parishes in the Paris diocese. Macron will give a speech in front of the cathedral at around 6 p.m. (12 p.m. ET). The Archbishop of Paris Laurent Ulrich will then strike the closed cathedral doors with his crozier, an ornate staff. Once the doors open, the cathedral “responds” to the knock by singing Psalm 121 – which begins “I will lift mine eyes unto the hills” – three times. After this, the doors will open. The ceremony then proceeds in three parts. First, the “awakening” of the great organ – the largest in France, comprising 8,000 pipes and 115 stops. Second, the “chanting of the office” – a series of psalms and prayers, including the Lord’s Prayer. Then, the archbishop will give a final blessing and the choir will sing Te Deum, a Latin hymn. The service will be followed by a broadcast by France TV, chronicling the cathedral’s rebuilding. The inaugural mass will be held Sunday morning at around 10.30 a.m. (4.30 a.m. ET), with Macron in attendance. After blessing the holy water, the archbishop will sprinkle it over the congregation and then the altar. The biblical readings given at mass will be the same the world over, marking the second Sunday of Advent. A second mass will be held on Sunday evening, which will be open to the public. For the eight days after the reopening, masses will be held twice daily, along with special evening ceremonies. Many of these services will be open to the public. On December 17 and 18, the cathedral will host concerts of Johann Sebastian Bach’s “Magnificat.” The cathedral expects to welcome up to 15 million visitors each year. For now, visiting remains free. Guests will be able to book a free ticket online and access the building either on the same day or one or two days after booking.",

It has taken months of painstaking cleaning and decontaminating of 8,000 pipes, 115 organ stops and numerous other musical components, but the majestic tones of the Grand Organ of will ring out once more. It will be the first time the revived instrument has been played in front of an audience since the Parisian landmark went up in flames more than five years ago. Like the Virgin Mary statue that emerged from the blaze miraculously unscathed, the organ somehow managed to avoid significant damage in the April 2019 fire. It was structurally intact, but remnants of the collapsed lead roof filled its cavernous pipes and the cracks between its keys. That thick, yellow powder posed no threat to the instrument’s machinery, but the dust needed to be removed for another reason: it was toxic to humans. So, as with countless other centuries-old relics and architectural elements inside the cathedral, highly specialized craftspeople were required to get the organ back to its pre-fire form, or as close to it as possible. Veteran organ builder Laurent Mesme’s company, Orgues Quoirin, was one of three workshops chosen from across France to restore the Grand Organ. Mesme described the process as “incredible.” “It was an exceptional worksite. Usually, the organ builder starts to work when everything is done,” he said. “Here, we had to work with the masons, the painters and all the other professionals on site.” The restoration process involved more than 30 artisans who spent months dismantling the organ and restoring its electrical and mechanical components before the deep-clean. They were among more than 2,000 craftspeople in total to be involved in the cathedral’s restoration, many using traditional methods from generations ago, according to ’s office. Tuning the organ took another six months. “This kind of maintenance, where you dismantle the entire organ, usually happens every 50 or 100 years,” Mesme said. “The next restoration isn’t going to happen any time soon.” To tune an organ, one needs a perfect ear and, typically, complete silence, the latter of which proved nearly impossible to find on the highly specialized construction site. To accommodate this, one team started tuning the pipes by day, while another team perfected the work through the night after construction teams had left. These nocturnal artisans were assisted by the four organists of Notre Dame, each of whom was intimately acquainted with the unique character of the organ’s sound from years spent playing the instrument. “It wasn’t possible any other way,” said organist Olivier Latry. “During the day it was impossible to do anything (with the noise).” Latry had, in his words, lived with the organ “day and night” since joining the cathedral in 1985. He said it felt strange to spend so much time away from it after the fire. “It’s really a very intimate bond that’s been established. And it’s funny, the fact that the organ has been out of commission for five years and we find it again, it’s a bit like finding an old friend we haven’t seen for a few years,” he told CNN. Thanks to this collaboration between artisan and musician, the sound of the organ has been restored to exactly as it was before the fire, though it remains to be seen if the acoustics of the cathedral will match once the new furniture is added. Latry and Notre Dame’s three other organists are set to play when the cathedral hosts its reopening ceremony on Saturday. The music for what organizers have dubbed the “grand awakening” of the organ will be improvised by the musician based on the emotion of the historic moment, according to Latry. When they finally play, the artisans who restored the organ will have etched their own unique mark onto a piece of French history. “Every time there has been a restoration, the organ builders have preserved what the previous organ builders have done. As a result, the organ is not the work of a single builder. It’s really a shared work that unfolds over three or four centuries,” Latry said. “It’s a bit like this organ is the history of France,” he added.",

    "content": "Five years after it was nearly destroyed in a devastating fire, Notre Dame de Paris formally reopened on Saturday with a two-hour ceremony inside the famed cathedral’s gleaming, newly renovated interior. Global leaders and dignitaries , current US first lady Jill Biden, Elon Musk — the world’s richest man —  and Britain’s Prince William joined French President Emmanuel Macron in a celebration that fused Catholic tradition with a dash of history and politics. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who attended last-minute and met with Trump and Macron at the Elysee palace earlier in the day, was welcomed to the church with a standing ovation. Some 170 bishops from around the world and priests from each of the 106 parishes in the Paris diocese were involved in the festivities, but Pope Francis did not attend. The pontiff instead sent a message, describing the cathedral’s reopening as a moment of “joy, celebration, and praise.” Inclement weather forced organizers to move the beginning of the service, which was supposed to take place on the redesigned forecourt in front of the cathedral, inside, where it was sheltered from the rain and the howls of nearly 40 mile-per-hour winds whipping against the building’s exterior. For the hundreds in attendance, the main show was not just in front of them, but all around. It was their first look inside the cherished UNESCO world heritage site following an estimated €700 million ($739 million) restoration. Centuries of grime has been wiped away to reveal an immaculate but aesthetically dissonant house of worship a Gothic church that glistens. “The world will find again this cathedral rebuilt and embellished,” Macron said. “Tonight, together, we can share joy and pride.” The French president, who is mired in a political crisis , attempted to use the global spotlight on his country to showcase French soft power while also stoking pride and patriotism at home, as he did during the Paris Olympics. “We rediscovered what great nations can do: accomplish the impossible,” Macron told the more than 2,000-strong congregation. “The cathedral became a beautiful metaphor for what a nation is, and what the world should be,” he added. And like the Summer Games’ opening ceremony, a wet and windy central Paris felt once again as if it was on lockdown. French authorities brought in an extra 6,000 security officers for the event and closed Ile de la Cite, the island in the Seine River where Notre Dame is located, to everyone except residents, law enforcement and attendees. Saturday’s ceremony kicked off with the tolling of Notre Dame’s bells, located in the cathedral’s tower where Victor Hugo’s hunchbacked bell ringer Quasimodo lived in 1831 novel. Dozens of bishops gathered outside, their white robes whipping in the wind as Archbishop of Paris Laurent Ulrich struck the closed cathedral doors with his crozier, an ornate staff, to officially mark the cathedral’s reopening. Through the doorframe, onlookers saw floodlights beam onto the downpour, providing a cinematic backdrop for Notre Dame’s spiritual leader as he led his clergy in from the cold for the first time since the blaze on April 15, 2019, after what investigators believe was an accident. By the time some 600 firefighters had doused the fire’s final flames, much of Notre Dame, a jewel of Gothic architecture, lay in ruins. The 315-foot spire that had graced the Parisian skyline collapsed through the lead roof. “The forest,” an intricate, wooden lattice structure under the lead roof dating back to the 13th century, was completely destroyed. Centuries-old murals and priceless artifacts were covered in soot and lead. Macron had pledged to rebuild, asking that it be done in five years – an ambitious deadline that some experts panned as unrealistic. Yet after a herculean, 2,000-plus day effort involving more than 2,000 workers, “Our Lady of Paris” was ready to welcome visitors before the close of 2024. The world got its first glimpse inside , when cameras followed Macron on his seventh and final visit to the construction site. There he met with various artisans and expressed his gratitude to the 1,000-plus craftspeople in attendance who helped him keep his promise. Organizers used Saturday’s ceremony to honor many of the firefighters who responded to the blaze. Dozens were paraded through the nave as guests applauded. Later, the – France’s largest instrument complete with its 8,000 pipes and five keyboards – was played once more. Following the ceremony, Macron hosted a dinner at the Elysee palace for the 50 or so heads of state and government in attendance. While Saturday’s events marked Notre Dame’s official reopening, the inaugural mass will take place Sunday morning. Masses will be held twice daily for eight days, along with special evening ceremonies. Many of these events will be open to the public but may require reservations in advance. CNN’s Saskya Vandoorne, Sérène Nourrison, Joseph Ataman, Christopher Lamb, Christian Edwards and Lauren Said-Moorhouse contributed to this report.",

    "content": "In their Upper East Side townhouse, TV power couple Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos have recreated a slice of Paris in New York. The glamorous five-story home has seen their three children grow up, but has largely remained unchanged since interior designers William Sofield and Emma O’Neill of Studio Sofield transformed the property into an Art Deco paradise more than a decade ago. Now, the co-hosts of “Live With Kelly and Mark” are opening the doors to the pristine space in the , giving a full tour that goes beyond the hints of chandeliers and holiday decor seen in the background of Ripa’s social media posts. While celebrity homes often have a short lifespan before being rotated out of their owners’ portfolios, Ripa told the magazine she has no desire to leave — ever. “I don’t want to sound morbid, but they’ll have to carry me out of here feet-first because I have gotten good and comfortable in this house,” she said. Ripa and Consuelos met on the set of soap opera “All My Children” in the 1990s and became co-stars once again last year, when Consuelos joined the long-running morning talk show, “Live,” which Ripa has co-hosted since 2001 alongside Regis Philbin, Michael Strahan and, most recently, Ryan Seacrest. In May, the couple celebrated 28 years of marriage. When they first purchased their home in 2013, Ripa was ready to move in at first sight. “I was like, ‘It’s perfect, just hand me my toothbrush,” she recalled to Architectural Digest. But Consuelos wanted to customize the property to both their personal tastes and practical needs. The result  mixed Sofield’s version of early 20th-century French glamour with functional touches, like dual Art Deco-style armoires that keep scooters and sporting equipment hidden from view. Treasures can be spotted throughout the townhouse: 1940s dining room chairs attributed to the artist and furniture designer Maurice Jallot; a Napoleon-style secretary desk, from around 1870, in the entryway; and the bedroom sconces taken from a decommissioned ocean liner. Some rooms diverge from the Parisian theme, including the kids’ rooms (which have been kept unchanged, even though they’ve now left the nest), and Consuelos’ cigar room, which boasts black leather couches, dark walls and a backlit bar with velvet curtains. But Ripa said, when it comes to interiors, she is drawn to theatrics. “I’ve spent my life growing up on sets,” Ripa said. “So I like a bit of dazzle. Give me a show.” Nowhere is this more true than in the main bathroom, where Ripa recreated some movie magic in the form of a white chaise lounge, inspired by the 1981 film “Mommie Dearest”. “There’s an amazing scene where Faye Dunaway, playing Joan Crawford, is lying on a white satin chaise in her dressing room, putting lotion on her elbow,” she told Architectural Digest, complete with a dramatic demonstration. “I had Bill (Sofield) make me an identical replica of it!” Ripa insisted on hammered satin for the piece, and Sofield’s warning against the decision soon proved to be sage. “I sat down on the chaise to apply some lotion, kind of as a joke, but when I put my leg down I basically destroyed the entire surface,” she recalled. She later had it reupholstered in cotton silk, to which Ripa said: “I learned my lesson.”",

    "content": "The City of London financial district has approved plans for a 73-floor skyscraper that will match in height Western Europe’s a mile to the south, in a sign that city planners are still betting on the office market despite the current downturn. The proposed 309.6-meter (1,015.75-foot) tower, which will be exactly the same height as London’s Shard, was given the go-ahead after a previously approved plan was revised “to better respond to post-pandemic office needs,” the City of London local authority said on Friday. Officially called 1 Undershaft, the tower was initially granted approval at a slightly smaller height in 2016 but never started. The proposed building, which investor Aroland has been trying to get off the ground for years, will require the demolition of an existing smaller tower and has attracted criticism from conservation groups. Historic England said in a consultation response to City planners in February that the alterations had not altered its impact and said it would “seriously degrade” the public realm around it. The tower, if built, would provide 154,156 square meters (around 1.66 million square feet) of office space, areas for children’s education on the 72nd and 73rd floors and a publicly accessible garden. London’s office market has been hit hard by higher borrowing costs and more home working post-pandemic, although premium space has remained in demand. Very few major London office properties have been sold this year. Investors Nuveen and Brookfield are currently trying to sell London office towers, in a major test for investor appetite. The supply of new space to let in London has slowed since the pandemic. However, office construction in the City has recently bucked the trend, with new starts up 7% between April and September this year, compared to falls in every other central London market surveyed by Deloitte. Critics say London’s skyline has become increasingly cluttered by generic glass-and-metal towers that dwarf historic landmarks, especially in the City of London, home to St. Paul’s Cathedral. “As another, much needed office development gets approved in the City of London, it speaks to the confidence that global investors have in the London real estate market and the UK economy more widely,” said Shravan Joshi, chairman of the City of London Corporation’s Planning and Transportation Committee. The Shard, currently the tallest skyscraper in Western Europe, was completed in 2012.",

    "content": "The past year has seen the opening of the world’s , the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral and the announcement of countless futuristic urban mega-projects. Yet, the architecture world has, increasingly, recognized the value of altogether humbler pursuits. In March, the industry’s most prestigious accolade, the Pritzker Prize, was unexpectedly awarded to Japanese housing pioneer while a in suburban Australia was later named the best new building at the World Architecture Festival. So, while 2025 will, as ever, be one that celebrates grand infrastructure projects and feats of engineering, smaller-scale designs — and those with genuine environmental credentials — may also find themselves in the global spotlight. From innovative timber buildings to one of Asia’s largest new airports, here are 11 projects opening in the next 12 months. The world’s third largest fish market is getting even bigger. More than eight years after the New South Wales government announced the relocation of Sydney’s historic fish market — which dates to the 1870s but has been on its current site since 1966 — the gleaming new four-floor building is opening on an adjacent 3.6-hectare site. Designed by 3XN Architects and Australian firm BVN (which visitors a “multi-sensory fish market experience”), the reimagined facility balances tourist infrastructure with the functional realities of a working wholesale market. Logistics and operations are hidden away in the basement, while the upper floors contain a market hall for visitors and an auction hall where restaurateurs and retailers bid on fresh catches as they arrive via pontoons. The project will also help rejuvenate an industrial part of the harbor with shops, restaurants, a promenade and an urban park, while the distinctive undulating roof is topped with 350 triangular solar panels. From April to October, Japan’s second city Osaka plans to welcome an estimated 28 million visitors to Expo 2025, which will see around 40 countries build custom pavilions on site. The centerpiece, however, is the venue itself: The Grand Ring, a continuous circular wooden structure, more than 1.2 miles in circumference, that will take visitors around the vast site. Expo venues can serve as an expression of their host’s design ethos. When Osaka first hosted the Expo, in 1970, it erected a huge space-frame roof by the most of the time. So, in an age where timber buildings offer an alternative to carbon-intensive concrete, it seems fitting that the Grand Ring’s creator Sou Fujimoto is presenting a distinctly Japanese take on the global trend. Using local cedar and cypress wood (as well as Scottish pine), the architect’s vision combines modern construction methods with the wooden joints traditionally used in Japanese temples and shrines. At almost 646,000 square feet, it will be among the world’s largest wooden buildings. Although intended to be temporary, there is ongoing debate about whether — or how — the structure might be preserved. The UK’s University of Oxford may be closely associated with grand gothic architecture, but it also operates in an ever-evolving portfolio of contemporary properties scattered through the city. The latest of them, a new 270,000-square-foot life sciences building, concludes the largest construction project ever undertaken in the institution’s centuries-long history. The design principles of the Life and Mind Building reflect an academic one: that uniting the departments of experimental psychology and biology under one roof will encourage greater collaboration and engagement between them. Inside, flexible lab spaces accommodate the needs of the different disciplines while a public plaza offers the chance of more casual interactions. Despite plenty of modern touches, the American architecture practice behind the project, NBBJ, nods to the university’s architectural heritage through stone facades and projected buttresses that produce what it calls a “a timeless but recognizable appearance.” Organic architecture is often celebrated for blending (or even disappearing completely) into the landscape, leaving as little trace on the surroundings as possible. There’s perhaps no better example among this year’s new openings than architecture firm Sordo Madaleno’s Canadian School in Cholula, Mexico. The serene campus looks to the region’s topography for inspiration — namely a nearby pre-Hispanic pyramid and the Popocatépetl volcano, which serves as a dramatic backdrop. The school is arranged around seven circular structures that take the form of overlapping hills, their terraced surfaces providing green spaces for students to explore. Mexican architect Fernando Sordo Madaleno, grandson of the firm’s late founder Juan Sordo Madaleno, said in a statement that as well as blending with the environment, “the building itself becomes part of the playground.” Cambodia is replacing its capital Phnom Penh’s international airport with one capable of handling six times as many visitors. Part of the country’s ambitious bid to boost tourism numbers and become a regional aviation hub, the new Techo International Airport’s initial capacity of 13 million annual passengers will eventually rise to 30 million. The terminal building, located 12 miles south of the city center, will be one of Southeast Asia’s largest. Plans to generate energy through an onsite solar farm also put it among the world’s greenest, according to architects Foster + Partners. With a form inspired by traditional Cambodian design, the terminal’s main roof is supported by a series of structural timber “trees” (real trees will also rise through a large central void). Digital renderings show the structure’s gridded steel shell filtering daylight and illuminating an interior bursting with tropical greenery, while passengers will reach their gates via two airfoil-shaped wings. A major expansion of Boston’s South Station, the busiest ground transport hub in New England, is wrapping up this year. Upon completion, the redevelopment project will have increased the terminal’s bus capacity by 50%, while its rail capacity will be unaffected. Architecturally speaking, the challenge facing American firm Pelli Clarke & Partners was not only to reimagine the hub’s concourse and erect a soaring 51-story skyscraper above it, but to respect the original Classical Revival station building. Listed under the US National Register of Historic Places, it has stood there since 1899. The resulting contrast — between gleaming glass and weathered stone — was always going to be stark. But the tower’s soft, sculptural form seeks to complement its historic counterpart. The expanded, arched concourse meanwhile offers visitors a more grandiose arrival into the city. The first ever African winner of the Pritzker Prize, an award dubbed the “Nobel of architecture,” is using his global profile to transform the built environment in his home continent. The Burkinabè architect is a longstanding champion of “vernacular” design, which looks to traditional building materials and construction techniques. And his vision for the new Senegalese branch of Goethe-Institut, the German cultural exchange center, is a case in point. The 18,300-square-foot building’s gentle curves were designed to mirror the outline of the surrounding canopies. It was constructed primarily from locally sourced bricks, which are made from compacted earth and arranged in lattice formations to encourage natural ventilation. Speaking to CNN in 2022, Kéré explained the importance of local materials, saying: “The more… you use, the better you can promote the local economy and (build) local knowledge, which also makes people proud.” More than a decade after the CCTV Headquarters in Beijing opened to become, arguably, China’s best-known contemporary building, its co-designer Ole Scheeren continues to leave his footprint on the county. The German architect’s firm, Büro Ole Scheeren, currently has major in various Chinese cities, from to Nanjing. Among the most striking among is Urban Glen, a pair of dramatically stepped towers containing nearly 900,000 square feet of office, hotel and leisure space in the eastern city of Hangzhou. Like the hills surrounding Hangzhou on three sides, the two volumes — one of which houses a Rosewood Hotel — appear to cascade into a manmade valley of roof terraces, shops and public art. The 2020s have seen Saudi Arabia announce a slew of mega-scale — and often bombastic — architectural ventures, from a new city to a cube-shaped skyscraper that will become one of the world’s largest built structures. But plans to bequeath the capital city Riyadh with a much-needed metro system date back more than a decade. Comprising six lines, the vast network is set to transform how the city operates, with a daily capacity of 3.6 million passengers. Above ground, its metro stations are becoming visual spectacles, with Zaha Hadid Architects and German firm Gerber Architekten among the high-profile foreign firms invited to design some of the 85 stations. While the project was inaugurated in November, and many of the lines went into operation last month, the project won’t be completed until the new year. Perhaps the most notable station yet to open is celebrated Norwegian firm Snøhetta’s Qasr Al Hokm — its striking stainless-steel canopy providing shade and channeling natural light into the cavernous interior. Europe continues to push the boundaries of wooden construction, with France now requiring all new public buildings to include at least 50% timber. Neighboring Luxembourg, meanwhile, is soon set to welcome one of the continent’s largest hybrid wooden buildings to date: the Skypark Business Center. Set across more than 844,000 square feet of floor space, it was built using over 542,000 cubic feet of timber — enough to fill up six Olympic-size pools — while the copper facade is made from 80% recycled metal. With its softly rounded edges, the structure’s unique shape can be understood as two alternating, zig-zagging strips that snake across one another along the site. Their various intersections create a series of courtyards and roof spaces, with the building’s occupants never more than 50 meters (164 feet) from a green terrace, according to architects BIG. The building, the first phase of which completes February, largely comprises office space, in addition to shops and a hotel. But ground-level courtyards will be open to passersby — and plane enthusiasts, who can enjoy views of the adjacent Luxembourg Airport. For almost nine years, the late Zaha Hadid’s firm has continued her legacy, producing dozens of new designs channeling the ethos and identity of an architect dubbed “ .” But the Danjiang Bridge, in Taiwan, was announced in 2015 — the year before Hadid’s death — meaning it will be among the last projects to be realized that she personally oversaw. The 3,018-foot-long structure will connect four major highways over the mouth of the Tamsui River, which flows through Taiwan’s capital, Taipei. It features a surprisingly slender profile, with the entire structure supported by just a single concrete mast (which the firm’s project description says “minimizes” the bridge’s “visual impact” on its surroundings). Nonetheless, it will become the world’s longest single-mast asymmetrical cable-stayed bridge when it opens later this year. It is a sign of the architect’s unique aesthetic that, even with just one mast to play with, its rounded edges and gently warped form is still, somehow, signature Hadid. Correction: A previous version of this story carried an incorrect figure regarding Boston’s South Station’s rail capacity and used outdated University of Oxford department names.",

    "content": "Driving through feels like flipping through an architecture picture book teeming with examples of Soviet brutalist, orientalist, modernist, futurist and neoclassical styles. One marvel after another, buildings in Uzbekistan’s capital city whiz by like a carousel for design lovers. After an earthquake leveled much of its infrastructure in 1966, Tashkent became a laboratory of urbanism. Architects arrived en masse to rebuild roads, apartment blocks, hotels, theaters, shopping malls, metro stations and a panoply of public structures that offered different takes on progressive socialist living. Today, new landmarks designed by the firms of “starchitects” such as the late and are in the works, as well as an “Olympic City” comprising venues  for the 2025 Asian Youth Olympic Games. Beyond the capital, the cities of Bukhara, Samarkand and Khiva contain an array of ancient “toki” (domed markets), “madrasa” (schools) and “caravanserai” (inns) built for traders who traversed the Silk Road. Now, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev’s government is pouring resources into highlighting this rich architectural legacy as part of a campaign to open the former USSR republic to the world. Conservation work on its historic sites is a top priority. “By preserving and restoring these unique architectural treasures, we position Uzbekistan as a global cultural destination,” said Gayane Umerova, chairperson of the Uzbekistan Art & Culture Development Foundation (ACDF) in a statement to CNN. The investment, she added, will be paid off “through increased tourism revenue, job creation, urban revitalization, and cultural branding, as well as preserving and reimagining our heritage in this new era.” Reimagining a collective identity is something of a preoccupation for a nation that only gained its independence from the USSR in 1991. Within Uzbekistan, where 60% of the population is under 30 years old, not everyone is particularly enamored with vestiges of its Soviet past. Young Uzbeks often opt to live in Western-style apartments and point to the gleaming towers in the international business district, including the sprawling , as points of pride. Inevitably, generic glass-and-steel modernity sometimes buts against preservationists’ agendas. The demolition of the iconic —  to make way for a business park — in 2017, in particular, spurred heritage advocates to action. Over the past three years, ACDF has held 10 exhibitions in 10 countries, including shows at and the . It has also convened conferences (one of which was headlined by celebrated Dutch architecture theorist Rem Koolhaas and another from UNESCO, the Guggenheim, Venice Heritage and the British Council), developed a “Tashkent Modernism” , and commissioned a meticulously researched titled “Tashkent Modernism XX/XXI.” Getting influential voices outside of Uzbekistan to rally behind unloved local treasures has, historically, proven to be effective, according to Ekaterina Golovatyuk, a Milan-based architect, researcher and co-editor of “Tashkent Modernism “Nobody really cared about Soviet modernism until that book by ,” she said, referring to the hugely popular coffee-table book “ ,” a 2011 architectural survey of 14 former Soviet republics published by Taschen. French photographer Chaubin’s travelogue, she said, spurred architectural expeditions like Canadian photographer Christopher Herwig’s catalog of Soviet bus stops and Garage Museum’s Soviet modernism guidebook series. “People … started saying, ‘If somebody is traveling from so far away and actually covering it in such a regional way, that must mean something. We might have been underestimating the relevance of this,’” Golovatyuk added. Social media influencers who introduce their followers to Uzbekistan’s under-the-radar wonders are helping, too. “It gives visibility to this architecture and transforms it into some sort of cultural and artistic product — something that you don’t perceive when you walk past it every day in the city,” Golovatyuk said. Amid the current construction boom, Uzbekistan is again serving as a magnet for progressive building ideas, just as it did in the 1960s and 1970s. This time, however, the most consequential issue is sustainability. Wael Al Awar, the Lebanese architect co-curating the Uzbekistan’s , says the country’s ancient cities are teeming with green solutions. Buildings are responsible for almost , and Al Awar points to the “standardization and globalization in architecture” as a culprit, adding that contemporary concrete buildings have also resulted in a homogenization of the world’s skylines. “Uzbekistan’s structures, in contrast, are contextual,” he said “They’re made by local communities who know the weather and the climate, and respond to that when they build. This is something we’ve lost.” Most ancient buildings in Uzbekistan are naturally energy-efficient, according to Takhmina Turdialieva, co-founder of the Tashkent-based collective, , referring to the historic public buildings and dwellings found in Uzbekistan’s Silk Road cities. “It’s very pleasant in the summer and (buildings stay) warm during the winter because of the choice of construction materials and well-designed air circulation. If we learn those passive design methods, we don’t need any new technologies to make buildings more sustainable,” she said. “Modern architecture in Uzbekistan should be based on traditional construction materials like brick and clay,” she added. “We can express different designs with those eco-friendly materials and keep traditions in mind. I think this is how we express modern Uzbek,” she says. This is taking shape in , a 20,000-hectare extension of Uzbekistan’s capital that posits to become a locus of sustainable design ideas. Zaha Hadid Architects’ winning design for the Alisher Navoi International Scientific Research Centre, for instance, uses locally made bricks to achieve the firm’s signature avant-garde swooping structures Turdialieva, who also leads the Young Architect’s Association of Uzbekistan, adds that a global spotlight on Uzbek design could help invigorate the country’s next generation of architects. “Maybe this will be a starting point when more attention will be paid to local architects so they can better develop their potential,” she said.",

The family migrated to Australia from Scotland, living first in a migrant hostel before moving to Burleigh Street in 1965. When the Easybeats made it big, a mini riot once reportedly unfolded outside the house when a fan magazine disclosed the address. Hundreds of girls from local high schools descended upon the house and twenty forced their way inside – trampling a young Angus on their way, according to the home’s listing on Australia’s National Trust Register. The one-story, two-bedroom brick house was bought by a property developer in March 2023 for 5.8 million Australian dollars ($3.6 million). It demolished the building last month, according to CNN affiliate . The developer, Burwood Square, told Nine News that it didn’t know about the cultural importance of the home, despite conducting due diligence on the site. “Unfortunately the historical connection to AC/DC was not identified, and we regret the previous long-term owner did not share this vital part of the property’s background with us,” said Leon Kamita, the company’s general manager. “Learning about this connection after our plans were already underway has shocked us,” he said in a statement. The developers plan to turn the lot into a 144 meter (472 foot) 50-story tower with 120 hotel rooms and 48 affordable housing apartments, according to Nine News. The suburban home, a bungalow built in the “Federation style” that was mass produced in the early 20 century, had been in “poor condition” since the Young family left it in 1978, according to a review published by the Burwood Council. In 1985, it became a brothel – with local newspapers promoting “Adult Work Opportunities” at the address, according to the council. It later served as a medical practice and was being rented out to an unspecified tenant at the time of the developer’s purchase. An article published in the Sydney Morning Herald back in 2003 argued for the building to be protected from the hands of developers. “There is however, one domicile begging for immediate acquisition and deification; a small, simple dwelling at 4 Burleigh Street,” wrote rock historian Glenn A. Baker. Although the house was listed on the Australian National Trust Register in 2013, it did not receive historical protection to prevent its demolition. Burwood Council conducted a review in 2015 to determine whether it should be listed as a heritage site. Ultimately, it did not recommend a heritage listing, citing among its reasons that the band’s “period of habitation was too brief to be relevant to the life and work of AC/DC.” The review also said the home “does not meet the criteria for aesthetic significance,” nor did it have “any known technical or research value.” In a statement sent to CNN, the council said “it has long-maintained that the Young House … has a special association with Australia’s rock music history as the site where band AC/DC formed.” Despite not recommending the heritage listing, the council said it continues to undertake initiatives to celebrate the band’s legacy, including the commissioning of a mural near the site. In its statement to Nine News, Burwood Square said it is “dedicated” to celebrating the location and is salvaging materials from the demolition to create a special space where fans can gather to celebrate the band’s legacy. CNN has reached out to representatives of AC/DC for comment. CNN’s Hilary Whiteman contributed to this report.",

    "content": "Two new 591-foot-tall skyscrapers, linked across the top by a daring “sky pool,” are set to rise above Dubai’s Marasi Marina. But the soaring 43-foot infinity pool will not be accessible to the public, or even to most of the luxury towers’ residents — it’s part of what its architects as an exclusive “ultra-penthouse.” Comprising 63 luxury residences, the new Regent Residences Dubai will be worth an estimated $1 billion upon its completion in 2027. The 35,000-square-foot penthouse features six bedrooms, a gym and a private elevator. The project’s other apartments, which all measure upwards of 6,500 square feet, will each occupy an entire floor. They were orientated to offer views of the marina and the nearby , the world’s tallest building. And residents need not worry about missing out on the “sky pool”: All the apartments contain their own private swimming terraces (and access to another 82-foot indoor lap pool). A series of newly released renderings show the staggered pool terraces jutting out from the two towers’ facades. The design was “inspired by cascading water,” according to Foster + Partners, the architecture firm behind the project. Real estate company Sankari (which developed the project alongside IHG Hotels & Resorts)  declined to disclose to CNN how much the “ultra-penthouse” will cost, though the other residences start at $10 million each. Advertised as the “jewel in Dubai’s crown,” the luxury development also features 10 floating homes dubbed “water villas.” Residents will enjoy access to tennis and padel courts, outdoor lounges, a private cinema and virtual golf simulator, among much else. The podium at the base of the towers will meanwhile feature open green spaces, restaurants and retail space. The project is part of a major of the waterfront Marasi Marina neighborhood in Business Bay, a new high-rise development on the Dubai Creek, south of the city’s downtown area. It is Regent Residences’ first property in the Middle East. The two towers are not identical though they share “same design language,” according to Foster + Partners. In a press statement, the firm’s studio head Gerard Evenden said the project’s “dynamic twisting form and articulated facade” will make it “a distinctive new addition” to Dubai. Foster + Partners, which was founded by the celebrated architect — and winner of the Pritzker Prize, the profession’s equivalent to a Nobel — , has designed numerous other high-profile buildings in the United Arab Emirates in recent years. Among them are an 80-story Dubai skyscraper, called The Index, and the House of Wisdom, a library and culture center in Sharjah. The firm’s sculptural Zayed National Museum, which will serve as the centerpiece of Abu Dhabi’s new Saadiyat Island Cultural District, is due to open later this year. It is not the first time a swimming pool has been suspended between buildings: built across the 10th stories of two residential towers, opened in the British capital’s Nine Elms neighborhood in 2021. A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that the towers will cost an estimated $1 billion to build. That figure relates to the developer’s estimated value of the project upon its completion.",

    "title": "\n      Pritzker Prize 2025: China’s Liu Jiakun awarded ‘Nobel of architecture’\n    ",
    "author": "Oscar Holland",
    "publication_date": "2025-03-04T14:00:05.077Z",
    "cate": "style",
    "content": "Throughout its 46-year history, most prestigious prize has often been won by icon-builders: the apparent lone geniuses who imprint their visions, signature-like, on the world. It is emblematic of the industry’s shifting priorities that this year’s Pritzker Prize, often dubbed the “Nobel of architecture,” has gone to a man who actively having a recognizable style. Liu Jiakun, unveiled as 2025’s laureate on Tuesday, has spent much of his four-decade career designing understated academic buildings, museums and public spaces in his home city of Chengdu (and nearby Chongqing), in China’s southwest. His hyper-local and self-admittedly “low-tech” techniques have come at the expense of a distinctive aesthetic. In China’s era of architectural excess, Liu has instead quietly thrived by letting each site — and the history, nature and craft traditions surrounding it — shape his designs, not vice versa. Whether repurposing earthquake debris or creating voids in which native wild flora can flourish, methodology matters more than form. In its citation, the Pritzker Prize jury praised Liu for precisely that: having “a strategy instead of a style.” Explaining his approach to CNN ahead of the announcement, the 68-year-old architect (who admitted to being “a little surprised” by the accolade) said he tried to act “like water.” “I try my best to penetrate and understand the place … then, when the time is right, it will solidify, and the idea of ​​the building will appear,” he said on a video call from Chengdu, adding: “A fixed style is a double-edged sword. It can make others remember you quickly, but it also binds you and makes you lose a certain freedom.” Liu’s firm, Jiakun Architects, has completed over 30 projects — all in China — in almost as many years. The architect has often turned to his country’s history for inspiration. Traditional pavilions informed the flat rooftop eaves of his Museum of Imperial Kiln Brick in Suzhou; the wraparound balconies of the Shanghai campus he designed for Swiss pharmaceutical firm Novartis evoke a tiered pagoda. But these nods to the past are never for history’s sake alone, Liu said. “I focus on the themes that tradition focuses on, rather than the forms that tradition presents,” he explained. In other words, elements of traditional architecture must be reinterpreted for functional, modern use, not used as tributes to a bygone time. Indeed, China’s cities are inundated with examples of the opposite, whereby curved roofs are added to otherwise characterless structures in the pursuit of an ill-defined “Chinese-ness.” “Traditional forms … are the results of the culture, technology and people’s philosophy of survival at that time,” Liu explained. “If we focus on the superficial results, we will stop at that time. But if we focus on the themes that tradition has always focused on, but use current technology and methods, then there’s a continuation of tradition.” Born in 1956, three years before China’s (and arguably the world’s) most devastating famine, Liu’s childhood revolved around the Chengdu hospital where his mother worked. He demonstrated an early aptitude for art and literature, though, like many of his generation, his teenage years were interrupted by the when he was sent to the countryside as part of Mao Zedong’s “educated youth” program. Liu’s career has, however, neatly coincided with the -Mao period — one that has seen architecture freed from state control and socialist ideals. He accepted a place at Chongqing’s Institute of Architecture and Engineering in 1978, two years after the former Chinese Communist Party leader’s death, and graduated amid the reform-era policies that opened China’s centrally planned economy to free-market forces. This period heralded huge changes for architecture. Key foreign texts and journals from the field entered the country and became more widely available to students and academics. Government-controlled design institutes, like the one Liu worked at in his early career, were finally permitted to charge fees, having previously only served the state. Yet, in the fast-moving atmosphere of 1980s China, Liu still felt architecture “lagged behind.” “When I graduated, it seemed that architects had nothing to do,” he said. “The economy had not developed, and ideas had not become active.” By the early 1990s, Liu — who was, at the time, also pursuing writing — considered quitting the profession altogether. He changed his mind after seeing an exhibition by a former classmate, the architect Tang Hua, that he says inspired him to escape the shadow cast by their sector’s state-controlled past. He established , one of the country’s very first private practices, in 1999. The firm’s early projects laid a blueprint for understanding Liu’s ethos. His Luyeyuan Stone Sculpture Art Museum, which opened in Chengdu in 2002, sits serenely in a bamboo forest, its rough concrete and gray shale existing in harmony with the stone artifacts housed within. The recesses and overhangs of his rust-colored Department of Sculpture building, completed for the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute in Chongqing two years later, are themselves acts of sculpture. At the Museum of Clocks, also in Chengdu, textural red brickwork alludes more to the area’s humble past than a gleaming future. As architecture in China became increasingly bold and bombastic in the 2010s (a trend that eventually led the country’s cabinet, the State Council, to the end of “oversized, xenocentric, weird” buildings), Liu’s output remained quiet and unpretentious — even when the scale of his commissions grew. By Liu’s own admission, his firm was always too small to tackle the skyscrapers or mixed-use mega-projects that redrew China’s skylines. But as his oeuvre came to encompass corporate real estate and urban regeneration, his motivations still lay elsewhere. “I am not very interested in the tendency of making taller and bigger buildings,” he said. “I am not necessarily consciously resisting it. I am just not very interested.” Instead, Liu seeks to redress some of the ills generated by his country’s rampant urbanization. “China’s cities are developing very fast, so they face two major challenges,” he explained. “One is the relationship with public space, and the other is the relationship with nature. I think my works focus on these two aspects.” Symbiosis between nature and architecture plays out at Liu’s ambitious West Village, an inner-city Chengdu block transformed into a courtyard but at a neighborhood scale. Sloping pathways transport cyclists and pedestrians around a five-story structure that encircles soccer pitches and lush greenery, a park reimagined vertically. This huge public gesture is accompanied by many tiny ones. For paving, Liu used bricks perforated with holes and filled with soil, allowing grass to sprout through the middle. A few miles away, the Shuijingfang Museum has been constructed using similarly thoughtful building blocks: “Rebirth Bricks.” Created by Liu’s firm using rubble from the Wenchuan earthquake, which devastated the Sichuan region in 2008, the reconstructed bricks (made by mixing the rubble with wheat stalks and cement) have been employed in several of his projects. It’s an innovation that typifies why Liu is celebrated for practicing a kind of everyday architecture in which local context reigns large. But does this mean the architect’s vision will always be restricted to China, the country he most intimately understands? Despite designing the for London’s Serpentine Gallery in Beijing in 2018 and lecturing at institutions including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and London’s Royal Academy of Arts, Liu has never completed a project abroad. Asked whether he would relish the prospect of a prestigious international commission, an opportunity winning the Pritzker Prize will surely present, Liu said his approach could indeed be adapted to foreign contexts with sufficient research and preparation. “From the perspective of method and methodology, there is actually no problem in doing it abroad,” he said, adding: “As long as I am fully familiar with the place, I think (my) set of methods is completely applicable.” CNN’s Hassan Tayir contributed to this story.",

    "publication_date": "2025-03-07T08:26:11.268Z",
    "cate": "style",
    "content": "Architect Ricardo Scofidio, whose work co-designing museums, art venues and public spaces — including New York City’s — reshaped America’s cultural landscape, has died age 89. A statement posted to the website of Diller Scofidio + Renfro, the influential architecture practice he founded alongside wife Elizabeth Diller, said Scofidio had a “profound impact” on its work, adding: “The firm’s partners and principals … will extend his architectural legacy in the work we will continue to perform every day.” The company did not specify a cause of death but said Scofidio died peacefully on Thursday “surrounded by family.” Born in 1935, Scofidio studied at Columbia University before practicing at a New York architecture firm and becoming a professor at the Cooper Union School of Architecture. It was there he met then-student Diller, almost 20 years his junior, and they founded their studio in 1981. (Architect Charles Renfro’s name was added after he became a partner more than two decades later.) The duo’s early work was more concerned with the theoretical underpinnings of architecture than the practice itself. Their output through the 1980s and 1990s is best measured in terms of installations, videos and performances, not completed buildings. Yet, the firm’s artistic beginnings laid a conceptual framework for its later forays into the built environment. After completing Slither Housing in 2000, an angular yet gently curved 105-unit apartment building in Japan’s Gifu prefecture, the husband-and-wife team increasingly turned its attentions to cultural architecture. Their Blur Building, a pavilion that appeared to float above Switzerland’s Lake Neuchatel, was considered one of the triumphs of the 2002 Expo, and they soon began building on a greater scale. The ambitious Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) in Boston, opened in 2007, signaled Diller and Scofidio’s arrival as a major architectural force. The first museum to be built in the city in a century, its upper volume hangs dramatically above ground, freeing up space for a generous public waterfront. The pair repeated the gesture soon after with the Juilliard School and Alice Tully Hall (both at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York), effectively removing a corner of the latter’s angular structure to create more space for the busy Manhattan intersection below. It was, however, New York’s High Line that propelled Diller and Scofidio into mainstream consciousness: In 2009, the year its first phase opened to the public, the pair were named among Time magazine’s 100 most influential people. Completed alongside landscape architect James Corner and garden designer Piet Oudolf, the project transformed an abandoned freight train line into a 1.5-mile-long linear park on Manhattan’s West Side. Despite its ambitious size, the elevated park’s design is often celebrated for the quiet moments enjoyed traveling its length — the diverse garden zones, the picnic spots, sunken benches overlooking a framed vista of the traffic below. Describing his approach in a about the project, Scofidio said: “The first time I came up here, I discovered the plants were incredibly opportunistic. Where there was sun, you had one kind of grass that was growing; where there was shade, you had a different plant that was growing. When we started thinking about the design, we realized that we could be as opportunistic as the plants.” The project sparked both a global craze for elevated walkways and — thanks in part to the re-zoning its creation necessitated — a building boom in its corner of Manhattan. Diller Scofidio + Renfro proved to be one of the beneficiaries when it was commissioned to design The Shed, a monolithic cultural center at the nearby Hudson Yards development that opened, to mixed reviews, in 2019. The firm’s other major museum projects include the United States Olympic & Paralympic Museum in Colorado Springs and The Broad in LA (both its original design and a major expansion project set to complete by 2028). Diller Scofidio + Renfro also completed a formidable of New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMa), which increased its gallery space by 30%. Scofidio’s legacy will remain intertwined with that of his Polish-born wife, who often served as the firm’s public face. (In 2018 she was once again named in the Time 100 list, this time without her husband.) Yet, he was known for his imaginative vision and technical problem-solving, quietly driving the firm’s creative vision from behind the scenes. “I’ve become what I consider to be the troubleshooter,” he in an interview in 2019. “When there are snags or hang-ups, I’ll work to find a solution.”",

    "content": "The dusty highway leading to Sidhpur, in western Gujarat state, winds through arid landscapes past roadside eateries and herds of lumbering camel, offering little hint of what the historic town holds. In the heart of Sidhpur lies a street lined with stately three- and four-story mansions, known as “havelis,” in a fading palette of rainbow pastel shades, from teal and baby pink to pistachio green. Known locally as Paris Galli, or Paris Street, it transports visitors to a European city with grand Neoclassical architecture and a harmonious melange of Art Deco, Baroque and hybrid Indian styles. Sidhpur is less than three hours’ drive from Gujarat’s capital Ahmedabad, but it remains under the radar of travelers and architecture enthusiasts. On the day of my visit, the neighborhood around Paris Galli appeared largely deserted, except for occasional passersby in the distinctive colored hijabs and gold and white caps worn by the Dawoodi Bohras, a Shia Muslim sect that first settled in this part of western India in the 11th century. The Bohras are a close-knit trading community that originated in Egypt and later traveled around North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia to trade in spices, gems and perfumes. The sect’s seat was later moved from Yemen to Sidhpur, where its followers showcased their prosperity and wealth by building hundreds of opulent residences in the first half of the 20th century. These housing clusters were called Bohrawads or Vohrawads, and the mansions’ owners tried to outdo one another with chandeliers, Belgian glass and antique furniture, or by hosting grand dinners. The community’s close trading connections with Europe may have influenced its architectural sensibilities. The region’s maharaja at the time, Sayajirao Gaekwad III, was also known to be fond of European architecture. He laid out strict planning rules, inspired by Scottish urban planner Patrick Geddes (who lived in India between 1914 and 1924), that resulted in strikingly uniform streetscapes, according to Sidhpur-born architect Zoyab A. Kadi. “The Bohras extended their help to other communities during a famine in the early 1900s, and (in return) the Maharaja of Baroda gifted them a tract of land, as they were facing a housing shortage,” he said. “It was on this land that they started building these magnificent edifices, which had to adhere to strict town planning rules.” Found mostly in Najampura district, where Paris Galli is located, the long, narrow mansions are made mainly of wood (the material’s flexibility is an advantage in earthquake-prone regions) in addition to plaster and brick. The designs feature gabled roofs, pilasters and columns, carved doors and ornate overhanging “jharokha” windows that protrude from the front of each mansion. The main living floor is located above street level over a basement; stepped plinths, or “otlas,” act like porches and were traditionally used as social spaces; whimsical monograms, featuring family initials or surnames in English, are often displayed on the buildings’ facades. “The courtyard houses, built in rows or sequence, exhibit rhythm with diversity,” said Ahmedabad-based conservation architect, Ashish Trambadia, over the phone. “While each house has a unique color scheme, unique stucco art and grill work; the precise alignment of plinths, roof lines and floor lines gave the streets a unique character.” India-based photographer Sebastian Cortés documented the town and its people in his series “ .” The images present a certain melancholy, from the faded glory of the mansions’ interiors to the women pictured gazing out of windows as they carry out household chores. “I was inspired by the mercantile communities of India… who displayed their wealth most aesthetically,” said New York-born Cortés in a phone interview. “This was inverse colonialism: The Bohras traveled around the world to countries like Burma (Myanmar), Thailand, Yemen and Ethiopia, and brought back various influences and then blended it with their own customs and traditions, using local artisans to create magic.” Kadi has also helped bring international attention to the houses by authoring three books about the town: “Sidhpur and Its Dawoodi Bohra Houses,” “The Vohrawaads of Sidhpur” and “The Birth and Death of a Style.” “At casual glance, the streetscape looks European, but if you look closely there’s the Gujarati tradition of using wood as a building material, and the capitals (crowns of columns or pilasters) are neither Corinthian or Doric but hybrid — a product of various influences,” said Kadi, who now runs an architectural firm in Chennai. “Many of the houses were designed to give women privacy, as most of the men were abroad working hard and making money. (The homes are) also suited to the local weather, in terms of design and materials used.” The houses’ names, like Zainab Mansion and Kagalwala Manor, often reference the people who once lived there. There are showstoppers, like the Zaveri house (also known as the House with 365 Windows) which is now stained black with grit, its grand pilasters and geometric facade carvings in dire need of restoration, and the Teen Khuniya (or Three-Cornered House), with its distinctive triangular layout. According to local resident and tour guide Insiya Bangalorewalla, the homes were typically divided into five linear sections: the “dehli” (a service area), the “chowk” (a central courtyard kitchen and bathroom, open to the sky for light and, today, ventilation fitted with grilles), the outer “pursaal” (a multipurpose room for living and dining), the inner “pursaal” (the coolest room, used as a bedroom) and the orda (the best room in the house, well-furnished and used by the head of the family). “From the street you can’t see into the house thanks to a veil called the ‘furtaal,’ which protected the privacy of the women,” added Bangalorewalla on a tour through Najampura. The homes’ interiors were often a visual feast decorated with geometric tiles, friezes, Persian carpets, dark mahogany and rosewood furniture, painted Belgian mirrors, antique corner pieces, family memorabilia and a special marble recess meant for storing water (water has an important status in Islam, and is used to cleanse or purify the home). “Sidhpur’s architecture is very unique,” said Kadi, “as the buildings inspired by Western ideas and elements have been crafted by Hindu architects (but) are suited to an Islamic way of life.” Official town figures suggest that, in the 1970s, there were at least 1,400 of the mansions across Sidhpur. But after India gained independence from Britain in 1947, many of Sidhpur’s residents migrated overseas, or to larger Indian cities like Mumbai and Ahmedabad, leaving the houses’ upkeep to caretakers or relatives. Today, many are boarded up, lying forlorn and derelict or caught in legal tangles between former owners’ descendants; others have been demolished to make way for modern developments, with the antiques and timber sold off by owners. The official data suggests that fewer than 400 of Sidhpur’s havelis are currently inhabited. To help conserve the disappearing mansions, Kadi, along with others from Sidhpur, co-founded the Sidhpur Heritage Collective in 2024. The group is working to document the town’s architecture, as well as holding workshops and guided tours. “Unfortunately, there are no heritage laws in India that prevent demolition of (privately owned) houses,” said Kadi. “We also have no funds or body helping us in this project. Even converting these houses into homestays and Airbnbs has not yet taken off. “(Sidhpur) has a lot to offer besides just these mansions, from a rich food culture to temples and mosques. I can only hope that we manage to save the town’s architecture before it’s destroyed forever. This needs public will and funding.”",

    "content": "Ever since opened its doors in London 174 years ago, the World’s Fair has offered nations a chance to show off the greatest inventions of the age. But Expos of recent decades have been as much about diplomacy and public relations as innovation. It is little surprise, therefore, that the mastermind behind Expo 2025 — which commences this weekend in Osaka, Japan, just three years after the end of Dubai’s Covid-delayed — doesn’t express his vision in terms of scientific or industrial progress. In an era of increasing conflict, the message is all about unity. “The whole global situation is very unstable,” said Japanese architect Sou Fujimoto, touring CNN around the site ahead of Saturday’s opening ceremony. “I believe this is a really precious opportunity to show (that) so many countries can come together in one place and think about our future together.” Japan hopes to welcome 28 million visitors to the event between now and mid-October. Designed by Fujimoto on a 960-acre artificial island in Osaka Bay, the site will host over 150 pavilions showcasing new technology, design concepts and multimedia exhibitions under the theme “Designing Future Society for Our Lives.” Among them are dozens of national entries, from the to the corkscrew-shaped Czech one. The main attraction, however, is the venue itself: Fujimoto’s Grand Ring, a continuous wooden structure, more than 1.2 miles in circumference, encircling much of the Expo. Made from Japanese cedar and cypress (as well as Scottish pine), it now holds the Guinness World Record for the world’s largest wooden architectural structure. The Grand Ring is symbol of unity, too, Fujimoto said. And while it serves a functional purpose as a pedestrian route around the site, while protecting visitors from rain and sun, the structure was also designed to demonstrate the possibilities of timber as a viable alternative to carbon-intensive concrete. “At the beginning, nobody believed it was possible,” Fujimoto said, describing the technical challenges of building with wood at such scale as “so huge.” The use of wood in large structures, , has accelerated in recent years. It’s a trend spurred by the development of advanced “mass timber” — typically made by gluing layers of compressed wood into strong columns or panels — and progressive building codes and policies promoting its use (France, for instance, now requires all new public buildings to include at least 50% wood). Engineered timber nonetheless remains novel in much of the world. But Japan has a long and continuous history of wooden architecture. The devastating earthquakes of 1891 and 1923 exposed the shortcomings of then-popular European-style brick and stone buildings. Today, around 90% of Japan’s single-family homes are built using timber frames, which are better equipped to withstand quakes. As such, Fujimoto’s Grand Ring looks both to the material’s future and its past. He combined modern construction methods (including steel reinforcement) with interlocking joints inspired by those traditionally used in Shinto temples and shrines. These joints required exhaustive study, with mockups made and stress-tested — sometimes to the point of destruction — to ensure their durability and seismic resistance. Fujimoto believes his country can remain a world leader in timber construction. It is a movement he has pioneered, alongside architectural luminaries like Shigeru Ban and Toyo Ito, since his eponymous firm’s breakout project: a home in Kumamoto, completed in 2008 and named Final Wooden House, that resembles an oversized Jenga tower. “We have such a wonderful tradition of wooden construction,” Fujimoto said. “And also, really wonderful craftsmanship from more than 1,000 years ago. So now, we can combine that kind of tradition with the latest technology to create the future of sustainable architecture.” The road to Expo 2025 has been, at times, bumpy for Japan. Venue construction costs have ballooned from an initial estimate of 125 billion yen ($852 million) to 235 billion yen ($1.6 billion). Public interest has meanwhile proven lukewarm, with Osaka’s governor Hirofumi Yoshimura last month admitting that the city was struggling to meet its advance ticket sale targets. On both matters, Fujimoto struck a diplomatic note. He described the final costs as the “proper price, not too high, not too low,” while expressing hope for growing “passions and energetic interest” from the Japanese public. “The atmosphere is changing now,” he added. “So, I’m optimistic about it.” While Fujimoto can justifiably distance himself from blame, there is another controversy to which he is more intimately tied: the fate of the Grand Ring. Whether, or how much of, the structure will live on after the Expo is a matter of ongoing debate in Japan. It is also a bone of contention among critics who believe that dismantling the structure would undermine its message of sustainability. Regardless of his wish that nothing goes to waste, the architect realizes that the decision may hinge on the funding required for upkeep and future events. “I, myself, (would) really like to keep it — to preserve it … because it is really wonderful, and it is like a symbol of how our society can live together with nature,” he said. Yet, Fujimoto also notes that impermanence has always been a feature of Japanese architecture. Traditionally, the country’s wooden homes were constructed with an expected lifespan of 20 years, and many Japanese people would sooner rebuild their house than renovate it. Some of Shintoism’s most important structures, including the famous Ise Grand Shrine, have been regularly torn down and rebuilt over the centuries, posing a philosophical question — akin to the ship of Theseus paradox — of whether a building is more than the sum of its material parts. The architect implored that, should the Grand Ring be dismantled, its wood is repurposed in other projects. Then, “even though the building is gone, the life or spirit of the materials will still be alive,” he said. In any case, the legacy he envisaged for the Expo is an intangible one: “Amazing memories and surprising experiences that inspire (visitors) to create something for the future.” One of Japan’s most celebrated living architects, Fujimoto was an obvious choice for Expo organizers. As well as practicing widely in Japan, the 53-year-old has become internationally renowned since being asked to design a temporary pavilion at London’s Serpentine Gallery, one of architecture’s most prestigious commissions, in 2013. Other recent high-profile projects include the striking L’Arbre Blanc (“The White Tree”) residential tower in Montpellier, France, and the House of Hungarian Music, an airy arts venue whose perforated dome sits nestled among trees in a Budapest park. Both projects are emblematic of Fujimoto’s architectural philosophy, dubbed “primitive future,” which explores the symbiotic links between people, design and the environment. It’s an outlook he has often attributed to his upbringing, amid nature, in Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost island. Fittingly, greenery is woven throughout his Expo 2025 design. “(We) couldn’t live without nature,” he said, adding that the site should “show how we can be together with the cycle of nature.” At the heart of this year’s expo lies the “Forest of Tranquility,” a congregation of around 1,500 trees, including native species like Japanese blue oak, Japanese maple and Japanese snowbell. Among them are trees replanted from Expo ’70’s Commemorative Park, some 13 miles northeast of the site, which serves as a permanent reminder of the last time Osaka hosted the World’s Fair. Architecturally, much has changed in the intervening 55 years. Expo ‘70, held the year after the moon landing, played out under a giant “space frame” roof and exhibited a moon rock brought back to Earth by Apollo 12. The event’s lead designer, the late avant-garde architect Kenzo Tange, was known for conceptual floating cities and grand, outlandish Fujimoto described the event as “a glorious moment of Japan in the 20th century,” but emphasized the difference between his Grand Ring and his predecessor’s centerpiece design: “Kenzo Tange’s roof represented technology and industry… but our ring is made from wood and is a symbol of sustainability.” Japan itself has also transformed since the previous Osaka Expo, an event alive with the hopes of post-World War II social reinvention. For Fujimoto, not all this change has been for the better. As such, his call for unity at Expo 2025 appears to be directed as much toward his compatriots as the world at large. “Japanese society is getting rather conservative and not so open,” he said. “(It is) rather closed to other countries and cultures… So, I believe this is a wonderful occasion (to) reconnect Japanese culture to the world.”",

    "title": "\n      How Vivienne Westwood changed the way brides dress forever\n    ",

    "content": "Few fashion designers are synonymous with weddings like Vivienne Westwood, whose — in fashion as well as in life — was fired by her disdain for corruption and injustice, earning her nicknames such as the “high priestess of punk.” It’s an ethos that may seem at odds with the conspicuous consumption that the bridal industry is associated with. But Westwood, who died in 2022, was also one of the UK’s , and the designs by the British house she founded in 1971 have long appeared on many a bridal Pinterest board. Through the adept use of draping, corsetry and other details that transform the wearer, Vivienne Westwood’s designs are flattering on the figure. What sets it apart from other labels is its signature punk and subversive aesthetics, consequently appealing to brides who crave something different and unique and want to express their individuality. Singer Miley Cyrus, burlesque dancer and model Dita von Teese and chef and former model Lorraine Pascale are among the celebrities who have worn a Westwood gown for their wedding day. Even WikiLeaks founder and activist Julian Assange and his wife were outfitted by the designer for their wedding, which took place in the high-security Belmarsh prison in London. (Westwood herself was a longtime supporter of Assange and called for his release from custody.) “People are drawn to Vivienne Westwood because she stands for something,” the brand’s creative director Andreas Kronthaler, and also the late designer’s husband, wrote to CNN in an email. “She stands for women, and for strength, power and courage.” He added: “The Vivienne Westwood bride is a heroine.” Yet, while several brides wearing Vivienne Westwood have been featured in magazines, including and , perhaps the most memorable example is Carrie Bradshaw (played by Sarah Jessica Parker), who wore a voluminous gown by the label when she was left stilted at the altar in the 2008 “Sex and the City” movie — leading to , where she chides her fiancé, Mr. Big, for the humiliation. One might imagine that to be the last of Bradshaw’s famous dress — but in an unexpected move, it was revived in the second season of series’ reboot “And Just Like That,” when she sought a last-minute look to wear to what it called the “Met Ball.” She gave the dress an update by accessorizing her look with a matching teal cape, gloves and heels. (The television series and sequel aired on HBO, which shares the same parent company as CNN: Warner Bros. Discovery.) Hoping to capitalize on its renown, Vivienne Westwood staged its first bridal fashion show as part of Barcelona Bridal Fashion Week on Thursday. Staged at the University of Barcelona and attended by local celebrities including Spanish singer Bad Gyal and Spanish actor Georgina Amorós, 35 new looks — including made-to-order and couture designs — were presented. In true Westwood fashion, these were no ordinary wedding gowns. Several looks veered away from tradition and were not a typical bridal white. There were also shirts, blazers and trousers. “The collection is a potpourri of past, present and future,” Kronthaler explained. “It’s what we are about. It’s the spirit of the house.” The first time that a wedding dress by Vivienne Westwood appeared on the runway was during her Spring-Summer 1992 show, though her history with bridalwear dates back to 1962, when she designed her own wedding dress for her first marriage to Derek Westwood. (They separated in 1965.) Westwood met Kronthaler in 1988, when she was teaching fashion design at the Vienna School of Applied Art, and when the two wed in 1993, she also designed their wedding looks: identical light grey wool suits with butter-yellow cotton polos. (Instead of wearing) one dress, today, brides love changing into different looks, to metamorphosize into different characters. Andreas Kronthaler, creative director of Vivienne Westwood Kronthaler declined to comment on the current size of Vivienne Westwood’s bridal business but said that it was “an important part of the house” as “something Vivienne and I have done since the early 90s.” He continued: “It’s grown over the years, and we’ve cultivated a desire for it, because we offer something particular and special.” Originally available as a bespoke service for private clients, Vivienne Westwood’s bridal offering has expanded since 2019 to include made-to-order collections that are sold in its five bridal salons in London, Paris, Milan, New York and Los Angeles. Its ready-to-wear bridal designs are also stocked by retailers globally: On Mytheresa, a mini dress made from crêpe satin costs $4,790, while a full-length gown is priced at $14,350. Today, Vivienne Westwood competes with a wider spectrum of brands, from emerging designers to established labels, which are looking to cater to . This year, Badgley Mischka and The Atelier by Jimmy Choo were among the high-profile names at Barcelona Bridal Fashion Week, which was the largest edition in its history, and drew around 450 brands and buyers from over 80 countries. Asked whether Vivienne Westwood plans to stage a bridal fashion show annually, Kronthaler sidesteps the question but said the brand would look to stage a runway in other cities. “We would absolutely love to do a bridal show in New York. I love the city, and I hope we can make it happen very soon.” For Kronthaler, his wife’s spirit lives on through the label’s non-conformist approach to bridalwear. He observed that multiple ensembles and multi-use looks are gaining popularity, as brides opt for various outfits that can be worn throughout their wedding day — and beyond. “Perhaps before (people) concentrated on one dress,” he said. “Today, brides love changing into different looks, to metamorphosize into different characters.” Kronthaler continued: “It remains a wonderful thing to spend your life with someone — and I think you establish and celebrate this through what you wear on that special day.”",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days. Dress for the job you want? If that’s the case, one might wonder what the stars are trying to tell us with their embrace of big shoulders and that seem more fitting for the boardroom than an off-duty afternoon. Miley Cyrus is the latest in a slew of celebs opting for power dressing outfits, defined by exaggerated shoulders and sharp tailored cuts. Among her several statement-making outfits in Paris this week, the singer was photographed wearing a Saint Laurent look that some took to be a nod to the maximalist style of the 1980s. Referencing the shoulder pads and oversized jackets embraced by the office-dwelling men and women of the era, Dazed the outfit “Reagan realness,” while one Instagram user : “Are the trading room floors from Reagan-era America in the room with us (?)” Embrace of the power dressing style can be seen as a way of asserting confidence and coping in a turbulent world. The trend also carries a sense of nostalgia, particularly for its heyday in the 1980s, when shoulder pads and clothing with strong silhouettes became a way for women to project authority and success in the workplace. The head-to-toe Saint Laurent outfit was a far cry from Cyrus’ usual aesthetic, which tends to favor lower necklines and cut-out designs. Cinched below the waist with an orange leather belt, her oversized, wide-shouldered leather jacket was the centerpiece. She completed her color-blocked ensemble with a red lambskin pencil skirt and green leather gloves, styled with sheer tights and spindly stiletto heels. Also spotted in Paris and embracing an oversized silhouette was Kendall Jenner, who — wearing a white scoop neck tunic and billowing black trousers — looked like a walking lookbook for The Row, the brand by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, whose minimalistic designs are frequently worn by the model. (In Jenner’s hand was the label’s , which she has been toting around since the roomy style debuted last month.) “In another universe she runs an art gallery where you trust everything she says,” was one social media user’s , which was enhanced by Jenner’s summer-friendly bob. The short hair has itself become a mainstay in power-dressing. It is perhaps best epitomized by Leslie Bibb’s , made famous by the latest season of “The White Lotus”. Bibb’s bob has lent itself well to power suiting, leaving her shoulders on full display to model boxy blazers and dramatic overcoats. Another advocate of the office-friendly style is Daisy Edgar-Jones who sported smart, minimalist styles during her “On Swift Horses” press tour in April. That included a gray wool skirt-suit gray pumps and rectangular sunglasses. The monochrome look came straight off Calvin Klein’s fall-winter 2025 runway, which marked creative director’s Veronica Leoni debut for the label. Although gray-on-gray sounds like it ought to belong to the depths of uninspired office fashion, Edgar-Jones looked fresh and fuss-free. The actress also wore a more daring take on the trend in an ensemble from Shanghai-based label Shushu/Tong’s spring-summer 2025 collection. Despite being conservative in length, the pencil skirt appeared to have its zip intentionally undone at the waist, revealing another layer of fabric underneath. It was paired with a cropped navy V-neck bustier top with a white collar. It takes a lot of confidence to show up to work in a cropped sweater and with your zipper seemingly undone. But if Cyrus, Jenner and Edgar-Jones are anything to go by in this new age of power dressing, perhaps these daring styles hold the key to getting what you want.",

    "title": "\n      Remember when Carrie Bradshaw wore her wedding dress to the ‘Met Ball’?\n    ",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: In the first episode of season 2 of “Sex and the City” reboot “And Just Like That,” Carrie Bradshaw faces a sartorial emergency: Her custom-made gown for the so-called Met Ball (the theme of which was “Veiled Beauty”) falls through at the last minute when the designer, Smoke, fails to finish it — leaving her with only a cape. “You must have something else fabulous to wear with my cape?” Smoke asks hopefully. “I can’t just go to my closet and find a perfect dress to wear to something called ‘Veiled Beauty,’” Bradshaw replies, before catching her own thoughts. “Wait a minute — I might have something,” she says. “I’ve only worn it once. It’s not the best memory.” Moments later, Bradshaw is in her closet, delicately unwrapping a ghost from the past: The dramatic — and feathered teal bridal headpiece — she once intended to marry Mr. Big in, until he famously left her at the altar in the first “Sex and the City movie. (The television series and sequel aired on HBO and Max, respectively, which share the same parent company as CNN: Warner Bros. Discovery.) In the final scene of “And Just Like That,” Bradshaw steps outside her brownstone apartment on New York’s Upper East Side, donning the voluminous gown with Smoke’s cape, which, serendipitously, is in the exact same teal color as her bird fascinator and slingback shoes. “And just like that, I repurposed my pain,” Carrie says, in her signature sign-off. The symbolism of the repurposed garment is poignant for the 50-something tastemaker. Once entwined with heartbreak, the dress is now synonymous with glamour, resilience, and an evening of celebration rather than loss. It signals emotional growth for a character who, historically, has had a fraught relationship with nostalgia and closure. “Bringing the dress back changes the sentiment of what it meant,” costume designer Molly Rogers (also of “The Devil Wears Prada” and “Second Act”) told CNN in a phone interview. “It shows that she has healed and is ready to replace a painful memory with a wonderful one. It’s a very Carrie moment: Sentimental, but with a hopeful twist.” For Rogers, the fashion moment also gives the gown — first seen in the Vivienne Westwood Gold Label’s autumn/winter 2007 collection and gifted to Bradshaw by the designer herself in the movie, along with a handwritten note — the comeback it deserves. “Sarah Jessica Parker (who plays Bradshaw) and ‘Sex and the City’ have long had a connection to Westwood, both the brand and the lady herself,” Rogers said. “So when we read in the script of ‘And Just Like That that Carrie would end up in the wedding dress again, it felt like a great way to honor that legacy.” Bradshaw’s choice taps into a broader style trend among A-listers: The rising love affair with vintage fashion on the red carpet. Where once the rich and famous only appeared in the latest couture designs, today’s stars are increasingly embracing archival looks, and opting for garments layered with history. See ’s string of vintage moments, including the she wore at the 2021 Black Women In Hollywood Awards, or the gown at the 2024 Met Gala; Olivia Rodrigo’s archival ; and Cynthia Erivo’s at the SAG Awards in February, where the outfits are about storytelling as much as spectacle. “When you look at archival gowns from the past you realize they’re almost like art pieces,” Rogers said. “I think many celebrities are tapping into that sensibility, and understand that the opportunity to showcase (a piece of art) is sort of amazing. That’s the magic of the archive gown,” she continued. Reviving “old” looks isn’t just about wearing them unchanged. In “And Just Like That,” Brawshaw doesn’t simply dust off the Westwood gown; she updates it. “For Danny and I, it was important to make the dress Met Ball-worthy,” Rogers said. “But we also asked ourselves, ‘What happens to the gown she doesn’t wear?’ We didn’t want her to just disregard it completely. Carrie is the kind of person who staples something together and goes, so we didn’t want her experience with the designer that didn’t deliver the dress to be a total failure. That’s when the idea for the cape came in.” “And Just Like That” co-costume designer Denny Santiago fashioned the mantle, which is as sculptural as the dress itself, from a teal ball gown The bird headpiece was restyled with a white mesh veil, while elbow-length teal opera gloves were added for extra flair — a nod to the Met Ball’s theatricality. On Bradshaw’s wrist, Rogers and Santiago clipped a small, round pin cushion — likely from Smoke’s sewing kit — that looked like a bracelet. “I thought that was a very Carrie thing to grab,” Rogers said of the detail. “She’s known for taking whatever is in front of her and making it into an accessory. She’s an experimenter, and we wanted that to come through in this look.” The Vivienne Westwood outfit is far from the only retro nod in “And Just Like That.” In fact, Rogers and Santiago have been weaving vintage references into the reboot from the get-go, making archival pieces a main aspect of the series’ style DNA. Throughout the show’s two seasons (season three debuts on ), classic pieces from the original “Sex and the City” series, like the iconic the and the that Carrie wears in the show’s two-part finale, have all made a reappearance. So have other less instantly recognizable pieces, such as a Carrie first wore in episode 15 of SATC third season, the she donned in the premiere episode of its sixth and final season, and the Streets Ahead studded belt that appeared in the first SATC movie. “Since I worked with Pat (Field, SATC’s costume designer) on the original show, I know what pieces people want to see again,” Rogers said. But the archival references dropped into “And Just Like That” aren’t just nostalgic easter eggs for longtime fans; they’re essential storytelling tools that chart Bradshaw’s evolution, both in her life and personal style. “Style isn’t static,” Rogers said. “As you grow older, you see a different use for things, or you cherish them in new ways. You reframe them. That’s especially true for Carrie, who’s a risk-taker.” The Met Ball gown is the epitome of that attitude. “Clothes can be a way of revisiting the past to reinvent yourself,” Rogers said. “The beauty of fashion and costume design is taking something tried-and-true out of the closet and doing something different with it.” After all, she noted, “why would you wear a bird hat the same way you did a decade ago?”",

    "content": "Fashion icons like , and the late are known for their distinctive approaches to sartorial style — bold splashes of color, luxurious fabrics, playful construction, capes — but fashion savants and historians agree that a common thread weaves their tailored looks together: dandyism. The history-laden style movement will be front and center as part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute spring exhibit, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” kicking off with the biggest night in fashion, . Inspired by Monica Miller’s book “Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity,” the exhibit focuses on Black style and specifically menswear from the 18th century to present day, with dandyism as a unifying theme. Once used to describe the aristocratic style and leisurely pursuits of figures like Regency England’s Beau Brummell, to embody liberation and resistance through exuberant self-expression. This evolution of the term began with the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Miller, guest curator of the Met exhibit, writes how, in the 18th century, young, dandified Black servants in England were forced to wear gold, brass or silver collars with padlocks and fine livery — uniforms for slaves and servants — that signaled their owners’ wealth. “They wanted the enslaved person to stand out almost as if they were a luxury item,” said Jonathan Square, Parsons School of Design assistant professor and one of the advisers on the Met exhibit. Slaves arrived in America with few or no belongings. What they had left, they treasured, be it beads or small precious objects, Miller writes. “This is as true for those who were deliberately dressed in silks and turbans, whose challenge was to inhabit the clothing in their own way, as for those who were more humbly attired, who used clothing as a process of remembrance and mode of distinction (and symbolic and sometimes actual escape from bondage) in their new environment,” Miller explains in her book. Stripped of their identities, enslaved people often added their own flair to their tailored Sunday best looks for church or on holidays. Post-Emancipation, Black Americans had the chance to reclaim their autonomy and carve out new lives for themselves, paving the way for . Black Americans fled the South for cities like Chicago, Los Angeles and New York in a period dubbed the Great Migration. From the 1920s to the 1930s, New York’s Harlem neighborhood became an influential and fertile landscape for Black cultural expression. From Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston to Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong, its prominent minds reshaped the fabric of American culture and challenged prejudiced beliefs. The Harlem Renaissance gave fashion a soul, said Brandice Daniel, founder of Harlem’s Fashion Row, an agency that connects designers of color with retailers and brand opportunities. “It was this birthplace of this visual identity that spoke to what we now call Black excellence,” she said. The renaissance meant living and dressing boldly for Black Americans, pushing past societal confines and making themselves visible. Adding their own twist on mainstream looks, women donned furs and beaded dresses while men experimented with tailored fabrics, pristine fedora hats, two-toned oxfords and billowing silhouettes. “Many of us have a photo of our grandfather decked out with the suiting, but it’s also the stance and the kind of posture and the assertion of presence,” said Tara Donaldson, co-author of “Black In Fashion: 100 Years Of Style, Influence, and Culture.” Black people are finally getting their flowers for being style icons Ev Bravado, co-founder of the fashion label Who Decides War , a pivotal figure of the era who often appeared in a three-piece suit, a frock coat and top hat, understood the power of self-fashioning, said Valerie Steele, director of The Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. At the 1900 Paris Exposition, Du Bois mounted a photographic exhibit centered on showcasing Black Americans’ economic, social and cultural contributions to combat stereotypes. “That kind of self-fashioning is very much a way of reclaiming a sense of self-respect that had been denied by a society that aggressively was saying, ‘No, no you can’t have that,’” Steele said. One style that arose out of the Harlem Renaissance, directly linked to dandyism, was the zoot suit. The suit, defined by high-waisted draped pants and oversized jackets with exaggerated shoulders and large lapels, was subversive simply by taking up space. Because of fabric rations during World War II, owning a zoot suit, with its excessive use of fabric, was an act of protest, Square said. “It’s meant to be a provocation,” Square said. “But also, it’s a form of protection, covering a part of your body, sort of saying, ‘You don’t have access to this.’” The style was quickly adopted by Mexican American and Filipino American men in Los Angeles. In 1943, servicemen and police officers attacked Black, Mexican and Filipino men in what was labeled the Zoot Suit Riots. The zoot suit lives on today in the gender-fluid designs of Willy Chavarria. Dandyism was not limited to men. Following World War I, women began breaking down fashion’s gender norms. With her tuxedo and top hat, blues singer and entertainer Gladys Bentley epitomized how women in the Harlem Renaissance blurred gender lines and adopted more masculine styles of dress. Singer and actor Monáe, who sits on this year’s Met Gala’s host committee, is not shy about standing out on a red carpet in her tailored, playful looks. Monáe’s distinct style and flourishes with oversized hats, whimsically tailored suits and ornate bow ties personify the dandy style. As Monáe and the rest of the starry guest list arrive in their glamorous “Tailored for You” looks, Monday will be a night to remember all the dandies who styled out before. “Black people, Black men are finally getting their flowers for being true style icons,” said designer Ev Bravado, co-founder of Who Decides War. “It is amazing to see the ancestral work being put on display.”",

    "content": ". . . These three figures come from extremely different worlds — televangelism, couture fashion and drag performance art, respectively — and yet all of them inform the singularly bizarre and flamboyant style on a raucous satire of Southern megachurch bigwigs that ends its four-season run on Sunday. (The show is a property of HBO, which shares parent company Warner Bros. Discovery with CNN.) The titular Gemstones, three wealthy adult siblings who’ve inherited their parents’ booming megachurch and TV operation in South Carolina, are “always on stage,” said costume designer Christina Flannery in a phone call with CNN. Perpetually playing dress-up, they wear sequins, silks and shoulder pads — and sometimes capes, to leave a room with a flourish. Even their more casual moments at home are opportunities to flaunt their flashy wardrobes. Take the image above. On their family property, eldest son Jesse (Danny McBride) is wearing a full leather suit in the Southern heat. Kelvin (Adam DeVine), the youngest, is bedazzled from head to toe. And eccentric middle child Judy (Edi Patterson) is wearing a power-clashing skirt suit straight out of the 1980s. Their gaudy getups are the manifestations of what children imagine fancy adults wear (and the Gemstone siblings are exceptionally juvenile). With deep pockets and thousands of eager worshippers hanging on their every word each Sunday, what does their church garb look like? “Absolutely more and more sequins,” Flannery said. Though it reserves affection for its (very) flawed characters, “The Righteous Gemstones” giddily skewers the Southern megachurch. With packed rows of congregants, an evangelical bent and technology that wouldn’t feel out of place at a stadium concert, the Gemstones’ megachurch isn’t far off from the real thing. See: The who have flown above parishioners for special events, much like the Gemstone siblings using jet packs to propel themselves across their audience during the finale of a telethon. Before the siblings’ takeover, Gemstone patriarch Eli (played by John Goodman) and wife Aimee Lee (Jennifer Nettles) anchored the family’s church until her death. It’s a nod to real husband-wife duos like Jim Bakker and Tammy Faye and televangelist Joel Osteen and his wife Victoria, the latter of whom still lead around per week at Lakewood Church in Texas. Some of the most well-known US megachurches, though, are in the country’s most liberal cities. Zoe Church and the Hillsong have marketed Christianity to a younger, hipper set of parishioners (including celebrities like Justin Bieber), partly through the charisma of the “ ” the term coined by GQ in 2017 that describes the clergymen who don streetwear in the pulpit and encourage a more casual churchgoing environment. “Gemstones” pokes fun at hypepriests, too, Flannery said, especially through Kelvin and his bestie-turned-boyfriend Keefe (Tony Cavalero). The pair also takes style notes from Siegfried and Roy, the magician duo who performed alongside tigers in Vegas for years, Flannery notes, through the emerald-green co-ords they wear to Prism, their LGBTQ-friendly ministry. Similarly, nearly all of Flannery’s inspirations for the Gemstones’ style are known for their flamboyant dress. Bakker (who went by Messner after remarrying in 1993) was a televangelist who favored exaggerated silhouettes and voluminous hair like Judy. And in the third season, the Gemstones’ showman uncle, “Baby” Billy Freeman (Walton Goggins), wears an oyster-shell ensemble that emulates Mugler’s theatrical pink silk-lined “Birth of Venus” clamshell dress, a nod to Botticelli’s 15th-century painting of the same name. Mugler’s work has become a sartorial touchstone for drag performers, too, for its open-armed embrace of camp. The , especially, has provided ample if unlikely inspiration for Flannery’s work on “Gemstones,” she said. Drag-inspired performance artist Leigh Bowery, whose surrealist gender-bending styles challenged conventional standards of beauty, and of “RuPaul’s Drag Race” made outfits that Flannery considers “walking piece(s) of art.” Drag and the world of Southern televangelism share little overlap in practice, but aesthetically, both are predicated on the exaggerated performance of gender. “They’re so influenced by each other,” Flannery said of the crossover. Bakker, in particular, was emulated by drag queens in the South during her ‘80s heyday for her heavy makeup and gaudy dress. Her appearance “reinforced the concept of gender as performance, thereby unintentionally intersecting with the crux of drag,” religion scholar Denis Bekkering in 2015. Though their politics are somewhat opaque, the Gemstone women operate within highly conservative evangelical networks. They also wear what could be considered the TikTok moniker for the heavy cosmetics preferred by high-profile conservative women like Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Trump campaign adviser Kimberly Ann Guilfoyle and former RNC co-chair Lara Trump. Inae Oh, a senior editor at Mother Jones, called the phenomenon “perceived hotness as a power play” in the Vox podcast “ in April. The beauty ideals favored by some Republican women helps reinforce traditional gender norms while asserting their power in a way that feels palatable to a conservative institution, she explained. “’You don’t have to be threatened by this woman of power because she is also what a ‘real’ woman looks like,’” Oh said. Amber Gemstone (Cassidy Freeman), Jesse’s wife, fits that mold. She’s rarely seen onscreen without a full face of makeup and styled hair and typically dons dresses that are form-fitting yet demure, and almost always with heels. Her style telegraphs her position of power in the family, as her husband’s supportive (and sharper) half. Judy is also rarely seen dressed down, but her skirt suits and perm lend her a more awkward air. Her style is stuck in the 1980s, inspired by her late mother’s church ensembles. There’s power in her last name — she was born a Gemstone; Amber married into it, a point of contention since they met — but she lacks the traditional beauty expected of a powerful Southern woman, and for that, she’s regularly discounted by others in her orbit. “It’s like pageantry,” Flannery said of her interpretation of what Judy’s idea of femininity looks like, adding that “Toddlers & Tiaras” inspired some of her more juvenile looks. There may never be another series that lets her take as wild swings as she has on “Gemstones,” Flannery reflected — the opportunity to dress Goggins as an old man in gold and purple lamé, or Patterson in a nautical skirt-suit with matching sailor hat. But she’ll carry that “crazy, sparkly, weird sh*t” with her in future projects, she said, letting the zany miracles of the Gemstones live on. Correction:",

    "title": "\n      Remember when Princess Diana wowed the Met Gala in a risqué — and secretly altered — gown?\n    ",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: Delving into the archives of pop culture history, “ ” is a CNN Style series offering a nostalgic look at the celebrity outfits that defined their eras. She was the most influential style icon of the 1990s. And was, as it is today, fashion’s biggest night out. So, while it may come as a surprise that Princess Diana only attended the annual fundraiser once, in 1996, it’s little wonder she was the center of attention. Then the Princess of Wales, she arrived at the Metropolitan Museum of Art just hours after reaching New York City by Concorde. Cameras and commotion had accompanied her every move since divorcing Britain’s then-heir, Prince Charles, less than four months earlier. And as she ascended the Met’s iconic steps with her friend (and the evening’s chair), Harper’s Bazaar editor Liz Tilberis, it was clear Diana intended to embrace the attention. This was evident not only in her choice of gown — a daring, negligee-inspired navy slip dress with a black lace trim — but also in her decision to secretly alter the garment into something far more risqué than its designer had intended. The outfit was the work of John Galliano, who had recently left Givenchy to take the helm at Dior. That year’s Met Gala theme (and accompanying exhibition) centered on the French label’s founder, Christian Dior. And Galliano’s first couture assignment was to dress the event’s best-known attendee. He visited London’s Kensington Palace ahead of the gala to share drawings and discuss ideas with the princess. Recounting the experience in last year’s Hulu documentary series “In Vogue: The 90s,” the British designer said he lobbied Diana to wear pink but “she was not having it.” The princess had it her own way — and then some: After receiving the finished gown, she drastically modified it without Galliano’s knowledge. “Fast-forward to the event, and I just remember her getting out of the car. I couldn’t believe it. She’d ripped the corset out,” the designer revealed in the documentary. “She didn’t want to wear the corset.” Royal biographer Katie Nicholl has claimed that Diana worried the racy outfit might embarrass her then-14-year-old son, Prince William. But the look appeared to be well received by the press and other attendees. “She just makes it a little more glamorous, a little more beautiful, because she is both,” broadcaster Barbara Walters told tabloid TV show “Hard Copy,” whose segment gushed that Diana was “a work of art.” Later that week, a New York Times opinion piece the princess had “demonstrated the restorative powers of celebrity.” Moreover, the look signaled that Diana was no longer constrained by a royal dress code — one that would have, surely, dictated a ballgown (or at least a far less revealing floor-length evening gown) for an event like the Met Gala. “She felt so liberated,” Galliano said in the 2024 documentary, describing the altered outfit as “much more sensuous” than his initial design. Diana’s jewelry choice also communicated reclaimed agency. She wore her sapphire engagement ring — on the ring finger of her left hand, no less. In this new context, however, the ring became a symbol of independence. It had reportedly reminded her of her mother’s engagement ring, and her decision to continue wearing the jewel established it as a family heirloom, not the vestige of a doomed marriage. The ring was later used by William when he proposed to Kate Middleton in 2010. The statement sapphire-and-pearl choker Diana took to the Met was, meanwhile, the same one she’d sported with both her “ ” (the low-cut satin gown worn after Charles’ infidelity came to light) and her “ ” (the off-the-shoulder number she’d danced with John Travolta in, 10 years earlier). Then there was Diana’s bag, which spoke to her status as a fashion icon. It was a mini version of one she had received as a gift from France’s then-first lady, Bernadette Chirac, the year prior. Designed by Galliano’s predecessor at Dior, Gianfranco Ferré, and unofficially known as the Chouchou — “favorite” in French — the original bag accompanied Diana to numerous public events. Her patronage proved so influential that in 1996 Dior renamed it The Lady Dior in her honor. Eye-catching, on-theme and full of symbolism — it was, in many ways, the perfect Met Gala look. And as fashion’s A-list prepares to follow, quite literally, in the princess’ footsteps at the 2025 fundraiser on Monday, it is worth remembering: Few arrivals on the museum’s staircase have generated quite as much excitement as Diana’s. Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Diana’s engagement ring had once belonged to her mother.",

    "content": "The Met Gala returns to the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Monday, May 5, drawing a bevy of A-list celebrities to the storied New York City museum for a night of exhibition-viewing, dinner and drinks. But first, they’ll walk the steps in what has become one of the biggest red-carpet moments of the year. Last year’s verdant spectacle of fashion — which saw Elle Fanning’s translucent bird gown, Tyla’s sands-of-time ensemble and Lana Del Ray’s thorny headpiece among the creative responses to the “Garden of Time” theme — will, for 2025, be followed by a lesson in exuberant suiting and Black style. This year’s Met Gala theme is “Tailored for You,” in connection with the Costume’s Institute’s landmark new exhibition, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” which opens to the public on May 10. The theme is chosen each year by Andrew Bolton, the curator in charge of the Costume Institute. Monica Miller, professor and chair of Africana Studies at Barnard College, will guest curate the 2025 show. “Superfine” will celebrate from the 18th century through to its revival during the Harlem Renaissance and its impact on fashion today. The Met Gala typically draws its dress code from the accompanying exhibition, which celebrities (and their stylists) are encouraged to interpret on the red carpet. The co-chairs, who host the Met Gala, are actor Colman Domingo, Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton, rapper A$AP Rocky and musician, record producer and Louis Vuitton men’s creative director Pharrell Williams. They will work with Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour to orchestrate the event, along with honorary co-chair LeBron James. The Met Gala’s guest list is always tightly guarded, but some famous names have been revealed as attendees, in addition to the co-chairs. Earlier this year, the Met announced it would revive a host committee for the evening, which will include athletes Simone Biles, Angel Reese and Sha’Carri Richardson; musicians Doechii, Tyla, Usher and Janelle Monáe; actors Ayo Edebiri and Regina King, fashion luminaries Grace Wales Bonner, Dapper Dan, Edward Enninful and Olivier Rousteing; and artists Rashid Johnson, Kara Walker and Jordan Casteel. A frenzy of A-list arrivals and photographs, the red-carpet portion of the evening’s proceedings last for a few hours, but that’s the only part the public sees. Inside, guests tour the exhibition, which opens to the public in the days following the gala, and sit for dinner. Phones at the table are discouraged, and the seating chart is carefully crafted by Wintour, who has organized the gala since 1995. (Wintour has the “final say” over every guest in attendance, the New York Times has previously reported.) Though the red carpet and after-parties get the most attention of the night, the gala is above all, a fundraiser, whose five-figure tickets raise millions of dollars for the museum each year — nearly $22 million in 2023, according to the book “Fashion’s Big Night Out.” The Met Gala debuted in 1948 as a fundraiser for the nascent Costume Institute, organized by fashion publicist Eleanor Lambert. Tickets for the banquet reportedly cost $50 each. Over the decades, the from an industry fete at off-site locations like Manhattan’s Rainbow Room into an A-list phenomenon. In the 1970s, Vogue editor Diana Vreeland positioned the gala as the opening soiree of the Institute’s major exhibitions and invited the crème de la crème of the fashion world and New York society. Wintour, her successor, has favored high-profile musicians, actors and entertainment figures, turning the gala into one of the most-watched events of the year. In 2023, software company Launchmetrics that the Met Gala generated nearly double the “media impact value” (the monetary value of buzz generated) for brands than the at $995 million. Last year, the Met Gala’s figure rose to $1.4 billion. The first theme was “The World of Balenciaga” in 1973, tied to a retrospective of the couturier Cristóbal Balenciaga; the event was attended by guests including Halston and Calvin Klein, according to “Fashion’s Big Night Out.” Early themes included “Romantic and Glamorous Hollywood Design,” “The Glory of Russian Costume” and “The 18th-Century Woman.” But gala-goers mostly kept to conventional eveningwear until the 2000s, when some guests began to have more fun with the themes — and the internet allowed more eyes on the arrivals. The most memorable themes from the past decade have included “China: Through the Looking Glass,” “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination” and the divisive “Camp: Notes on Fashion” thanks to celebrities including Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Zendaya and the Kardashian-Jenners, who use the red carpet to put on a show. Last year’s “The Garden of Time” theme referenced a 1962 short story of the same name by . Each year rumors fly about who may be persona non grata at the gala, whether due to any offense towards the event or Wintour herself. But the Vogue editor has only explicitly spoken about one guest she would “never invite back” in public — US President whom she mentioned on James Corden’s late night talk show in 2017 when asked to name names. Other previous guests have sworn it off, however, including Demi Lovato, Zayn Malik and Tina Fey. In 2015, five years after she made an appearance at the event, Fey said on “Late Show with David Letterman” that the gala is a “ .” “If you had a million arms, all the people you would want to punch in the whole world — they’re all there,” she said. “I mean I was there, clearly I was one of them.” Some celebrities backtrack, however. Gwyneth Paltrow the Met Gala “un-fun” in 2013 and said she’d “never” go again, but returned in 2017 (and 2019). Met Gala guests have often broken the no-social-media rule to give a more candid glimpse of who is hanging with who and what goes on behind closed doors. In 2017, that included smoking, as attendees including Bella Hadid and Dakota Johnson were seen lighting up cigarettes in the museum’s bathroom (to the ire of the museum’s donors, reportedly). Despite what would have you believe, he — nor anyone else — has taken a tumble down the stairs. But some guests have famously rumbled — this year marks 11 years since the infamous after-party elevator fight between Jay-Z and Solange. A final faux pas? Wearing the same outfit, of course. While it’s been that Wintour not only arranges the guest list but also has a hand in their fashion choices, in 2023, Olivia Wilde and former Vogue China editor Margaret Zhang showed up in the same Chloé violin dress in different color schemes. The pair took it in stride, sharing memes on social media about the incident. “Great minds,” Wilde wrote on Instagram. “If you’re gonna twin with anyone, make it @margaretzhang.”",

    "content": "Shah Rukh Khan is one of the world’s most famous men. And yet, strutting down the carpet still gave the Bollywood star jitters. Khan, known as SRK to fans, made his Met debut in understated style, donning a floor-length black wool coat designed by Indian designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee. The look was complemented with several bold accessories, including a large sparkling “K” dangling from a chain and a gem-encrusted tiger head cane. To combat his nerves, perhaps — Khan told Vogue livestream hosts Ego Nwodim and Teyana Taylor that he’s “very shy” and typically skips red carpets — he asked Mukherjee to stick to his style staples. “I told Sabya I only wear black and white, but what we designed for me is what I’m most comfortable in,” he said. “That’s how I think it should be.” The star of more than 100 movies, Khan’s arrival on the Met Gala carpet has been a long time coming. But Mukherjee said that it was fitting that Khan debuts the same year the event celebrates Black designers and the legacy of , a fashion movement as steeped in politics as it is in impeccable style. “When you get a man like this on the red carpet, especially when it’s ‘Black dandy,’ representation is the most important thing,” Mukherjee said. “We wanted to represent Shah Rukh Khan as Shah Rukh Khan, and nobody else.” Mukherjee, too, is a global superstar: His label Sabyasachi’s and regularly appear on Bollywood stars, and earlier this year he said he wants to make Sabyasachi “India’s first global luxury brand.” He recently celebrated his label’s 25th anniversary, complete with a with over 150 looks influenced by his West Bengal upbringing.

    "content": "After revealing her second pregnancy in dramatic fashion during her 2023 halftime Super Bowl performance, Rihanna has followed up by debuting her third on the Met Gala red carpet. The last attendee to arrive at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art on Monday evening, the star wore a pinstripe Marc Jacobs ensemble, accentuating her baby bump, with a polkadot cravat and oversized hat. Rihanna’s pregnancy announcement came on an historic evening, co-chaired by her partner A$AP Rocky, that celebrated exuberant Black style and dandyism. The evening’s theme was inspired by the Met’s accompanying Costume Institute exhibition, “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style.” A$AP Rocky arrived hours earlier wearing a self-designed outfit that he told Vogue was “a bit of Harlem Nights,” referencing Eddie Murphy’s classic 1989 crime comedy movie. He accessorized with an umbrella and red-soled Christian Louboutin shoes. The singer and rapper have two sons together. Earlier in the day, the Barbadian singer was photographed walking around New York in the rain in a gray-blue cropped top and skirt set with a fur stole and 1920s-style cloche hat with a visible bump, igniting conversation online. On the Met Gala red carpet, A$AP Rocky confirmed the news to Reuters, saying “it feels amazing” to reveal Rihanna’s pregnancy at the event. CNN has reached out to Rihanna’s representatives. Rihanna wasn’t the only celebrity with a pregnancy reveal on the red carpet, with model Karlie Kloss appearing in a black buttoned jacket with high lapels — her first appearance since announcing her third child in March. The Met Gala red carpet has become a popular place for pregnancy reveals, with model Adwoa Aboah doing so last year in a ruffled red two-piece set, and tennis star (again) the year prior. “There’s three of us here,” Wiliams told La La Anthony during Vogue’s live red carpet show in 2023. “I can stop hiding now,” she added. That same year, Rihanna shut down the Karl Lagerfeld tribute-themed Met Gala, arriving last in an all-white Valentino gown and hooded coat adorned with a camellia flower motif, which she took off to reveal her growing baby bump. The singer and Fenty Beauty founder is widely credited for her influence on celebrity maternity style thanks to her throughout both of her pregnancies, from a third-trimester sheer skirt over a thong to Dior’s Fall-Winter 2022 show, to a green and purple metallic fringe set by The Atitco to a Fenty Beauty event. “When I found out I was pregnant, I thought to myself, ‘There’s no way I’m going to go shopping in no maternity aisle.’ I’m sorry — it’s too much fun to get dressed up,” she told Vogue for the magazine’s May 2022 cover. “I’m not going to let that part disappear because my body is changing.” The all-red unzipped flight suit, matching catsuit and sculpted leather corset — designed by Loewe under creative director Jonathan Anderson — that Rihanna wore during her halftime Super Bowl performance the next year became immediately engrained in pop culture history.",

    "content": "Ahead of a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee, former Vice President Kamala Harris made a surprise appearance at the Met Gala in New York, along with husband Doug Emhoff, wearing a custom black-and-white gown by Off-White. Though they skipped the red carpet, Harris appears in photos ahead of the event wearing an elegant silk silhouette with an asymmetrical cape sleeve and a long scarf — a look meant to evoke a sense of timelessness, according to the luxury label. The former vice president was invited by Vogue editor-in-chief and Met Gala co-chair Anna Wintour, according to a spokesperson for Harris. She has made few high-profile appearances since losing the presidential election in November, though she has recently given two speeches at the Leading Women Defined Summit and Emerge Gala, the latter of which benefits an organization that recruits and trains women to run for office. In both, Harris has rebuked US President Trump’s first 100 days in office. “Instead of an administration working to advance America’s highest ideals, we are witnessing the wholesale abandonment of those ideals,” at the Emerge Gala last Wednesday. “And what we are also seeing in these last 14 weeks is Americans using their voice and showing their courage.” Over the course of her vice presidency, Harris’ fashion choices often evoked subtle symbolism, from the and pussybow blouse she wore as she stepped into the role, to a tan Chloé suit at last year’s Democratic National Convention that seemed to be a to former President Obama. The former vice president also appeared on the cover of Vogue twice, with her first portrait over her more casual demeanor in a black jacket and Converse sneakers, photographed by Tyler Mitchell. At the Met Gala, Harris celebrated the spirit of the Costume Institute’s exhibition “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style” in her look from Off-White. The show explores the exuberant and subversive history of Black dandyism, based on the landmark book “Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity,” by the show’s guest curator and scholar Monica L. Miller. The exhibition on Black sartorial history is going on during an uncertain time for museums, as the Trump administration has made calls to and has for their exhibitions on race and gender. “To me the true core of dandyism is rooted in confidence and strength. There is no person who exemplifies these characteristics more than Kamala D. Harris, someone who has overcome adversity and continues to be a beacon for so many,” Off-White creative director IB Kamara said in a statement shared with CNN. The night marks her first appearance at the Met Gala, though she’s far from the only politician to grace the museum’s steps during fashion’s biggest night out. In 2022, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton attended the Met Gala for the first time in two decades wearing a red Altuzarra gown embroidered with the names of trailblazing American women, including Harriet Tubman and Eleanor Roosevelt. The year prior, US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made a splashy statement in a white Brother Vellies gown emblazoned with “Tax the Rich” in red. Wintour has said, however, that US President Trump is persona non grata at the event. In 2017, during his first term, the Vogue editor told James Corden on his late-night talk show that he is one person she would “never invite back.”",

There were many firsts at the 2025 Met Gala — it was the first exhibition to focus exclusively on Black designers, and the first year the event raised more than $30 million in donations. But among these record-breaking moments was an important return. After a hiatus of more than two decades, disco legend and one-third of The Supremes, Diana Ross, graced the Met steps once more for fashion’s biggest night of the year. Ross, who last attended the Met Gala back in 2003, arrived at the event Monday adorned in feathers and sporting a jaw-dropping 18-foot-long train. It took five men to carry the star’s hand-embroidered ivory white accessory, which enveloped the carpeted steps when laid flat. But hidden in the yards of fabric was a small detail many may have missed. “It has (stitched) the names of all my children and my eight grandchildren,” carpet-side, calling the dress “a forever family gown.” On her arm was Evan Ross, her son and the co-creator of the look. “She is the best thing. She is the Met Ball,” he told Vogue. Ross worked with Ugo Mozie, a Nigerian designer and founder of fashion label Eleven Sixteen to bring his mother’s show-stopping ensemble to life. “Family. Heritage. Legacy,” . “So grateful to be a part of this special moment. To have co-designed this work of art for an Icon.” Underneath the larger-than-life train, the Motown singer donned a crystal-embellished spaghetti-strapped gown and a dazzling pair of chandelier earrings. On her head sat a custom, wide-brimmed feathered hat by LA-based milliner Sarah Sokol. Despite being one of the most memorable outfits of the evening, Ross let slip that her appearance was actually last minute. “There was not a plan,” she said. “My son persuaded me (to come), because I’m actually on tour. He said, ‘Mom, you gotta go.’” Luckily for us, she had just the thing to wear.",

    "content": "Over the last few years, one styling trend has dominated the red carpet circuit more plainly than any other in recent memory. The ‘naked’ dress — a gown built on the suggestion of exposing its wearer’s nudity — quickly revealed itself as a surefire way for celebrities to grab headlines and has therefore enjoyed full-frontal support from a number of those in show business. But any celebrity stylist bound for the South of France hoping to enlist the powerful tools of chiffon or sheer lace will need to think again after an amendment was spotted in the Cannes Film Festival dress code just 24-hours ahead of the event’s grand opening this Tuesday. According to the , “nudity is prohibited on the red carpet, as well as any other area of the festival.” The decision, which will have a direct impact on the ever-growing ‘naked’ dress trend, has been taken “for decency reasons,” it added. It’s fair to say, this year’s Cannes red carpet will look drastically different. Just last year, model Bella Hadid arrived in a sandy-brown Saint Laurent number with a completely sheer halter-neck top. Also by Saint Laurent was photographer Nadia Lee Cohen’s slinky see-through knit dress worn to the premiere of the film “The Shrouds.” A few days later, actress Vicky Krieps went for a transparent boudoir-themed Armani Privé gown. It’s unclear, however, if any of these dresses would be permitted at this year’s festivities, given they reveal varying degrees of undress. In fact, ‘naked’ dresses are not created equal — at least not equally exposing. Instead of providing clarity and guidance around sartorial choices, the added clause in Cannes’ dress code potentially raises more questions. What is their definition of nudity? Would a printed image of a birthday suit, such as those found on dresses from the 1990s, breach the new dress code? Or does nakedness only resonate in 3D? Is nudity regarded holistically, or does a flashed nipple — a la in hot pink Valentino — risk entry refusal to the Croisette? The updated guidance — which is one of two major changes to the dress code, alongside a ban on “voluminous” outfits with a large train (sorry, ) — may have been influenced not just by the ubiquity of such dresses, but extreme cases that overshadowed the events to which they were worn. Earlier this year, on barely-there frocks when she donned a piece of translucent netting to the Grammys alongside her husband Ye. Forgoing underwear, and arguably any artistic flourish, the outfit seemed to mark a new era of the trend — where the power of suggestion had been thwarted by the blunt force of shock value. For Cannes Film Festival organizers, it’s the kind of exhibitionism they would rather keep on the beach and off their red carpet.",

    "content": "India’s massive, twice-a-decade exercise in democracy is once again leaving its mark on the country’s people, in the form of purple-streaked index fingers. The Election Commission uses indelible ink, or “voter ink”, to prevent fraud or duplicate votes. Once a voter arrives at the booth to cast their ballot and has their ID verified, the ink is painted across the top of their left index finger, leaving a stain that can take up to two weeks to wash off. It may be rudimentary, but the method has been so effective that it’s been in place for more than seven decades. “Right from the prime minister to the most common person, everybody flashes their (marked) finger,” said K Mohammed Irfan, managing director of Mysore Varnish and Paints Limited (MVPL), the state-owned company that exclusively makes and distributes the liquid to polling booths across the nation. “From celebrities to film stars… (it has become) a mark of democracy that I think is synonymous with elections,” he told CNN in a video interview. More than 960 million people are eligible to vote in , the world’s biggest. And workers at the company’s factory in Mysuru, a city in southwestern Karnataka state, have spent months preparing nearly 2.7 million ink vials, its largest order to date. The orange containers were filled and carefully packed for distribution ahead of this year’s elections, which are underway and end June 1. Each vial contains enough liquid to mark approximately 700 voters. The key to the ink’s literal staying power? A tightly guarded formula which has remained unchanged since 1951. “Indelible ink serves no other purpose,” said Irfan. “We only manufacture the required quantity.” While Irfan says the company is “bound to secrecy” when it comes to the ink’s exact composition, it does contain the chemical compound silver nitrate, which causes a purplish stain when it comes into contact with skin and is exposed to sunlight. When newly independent India held its first-ever general elections in 1951 and 1952, organizers turned to the idea of using indelible ink to mark voters, in efforts to ensure a fair ballot. “In a country where there was no systematic registration of births, or identity documents, and with millions of people on the move as refugees, the question of how to prevent impersonation and double voting was a source of great concern,” said Ornit Shani, author of “How India Became Democratic: Citizenship and the Making of the Universal Franchise.” Some officials thought the method would take too much time and complicate the voting process, according to Shani, but public opinion eventually won out. “Combined with the practice that all voters, irrespective of their caste, class and religions would stand in the same line, (having to wait) for their turn to have their finger marked (before they) cast their vote, further contributed to making concrete and visible the core value of the equality of the vote,” Shani said in an email to CNN. “One man, one woman, one vote.” MVPL was founded as a paint supplier in 1937 by the then maharaja or ruler of Mysore, Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV, and retains that side of its business. According to Irfan, when the company isn’t producing ink, it’s supplying, among other products, paint for the public transport sector. The ink’s appeal has spilled beyond India’s borders too. The company now supplies indelible ink to more than 35 countries, including to Ghana beginning in the late 1970s. However, Ghana’s election commission recently announced it would phase out the use of indelible ink, opting for biometric verification methods instead. But the use of the ink in India doesn’t appear to be going away any time soon. For Mukulika Banerjee, an associate professor of anthropology at the London School of Economics, the practice of marking a body may not translate well in other cultures, but it works in India due to common cultural practices. “People routinely have their hands decorated with henna, or women have their feet decorated with different colors,” said Banerjee in a phone interview. “I would argue that the marking of the finger (semi-permanently) kind of fits into it in a way that it might not fit in other contexts.” She also pointed to an unintentional effect of marking voters with ink: creating an environment of peer pressure. Banerjee was able to find instances of this during her research on democracy and elections in West Bengal. “First thing on polling day people do is check out each other’s fingers,” she said. “And if your left index finger is not carrying the indelible mark, they’ll look at you and the first thing they’ll say is ‘Why haven’t you voted?’ “You can make excuses, but by the fifth time in the day, if somebody asks you and it gets so annoying, it’s actually easier to go and vote than to not vote.” The peer pressure extends to movie stars and athletes, who are likely to post their ink-stained fingers to their millions of fans on social media. “These guys have begun to hold up (their fingers) and take selfies of having voted and say ‘I’ve voted, have you?’ because they feel they have a civic duty to encourage others to vote as well,” she added. “So it becomes aspirational; then you want to be like your hero and you want to be able to do the same thing.”",

    "title": "\n      How Britain’s political parties got their colors\n    ",

    "content": "With the UK’s general election just days away, British voters have seen their TV screens, mailboxes and newsfeeds fill with color. Just like commercial brands, political parties know that using a single, bold shade can make them easier to recognize — whether that’s out on the campaign trail or checking the latest polls. On July 4, the blue of the ruling Conservatives will go head-to-head with the red of Labour. While these are the only two parties with a realistic chance of winning , other smaller parties across the British political system offer a veritable kaleidoscope of differing — and sometimes duplicate — colours. The Liberal Democrats (orange), and Reform UK (turquoise) and the Green Party (you guessed it), are all vying for votes. The Scottish National Party uses yellow, while Northern Ireland’s Sinn Féin and Wales’ Plaid Cymru are represented by nearly identical shades of green. Although the older, established parties trace these associations back to their foundation, the importance of color in campaigning blossomed with the advent of new technology and advertising between the 1950s and 1970s, explained Dominic Wring, a professor of political communication at the UK’s Loughborough University. “The advertising industry itself underwent a change around the introduction of color television, so, increasingly, colors and more ambitious or innovative designs became quite significant,” he said in a phone interview, adding that, during this time, “parties began to simplify their messaging.” Beyond simple brand recognition, certain colors have long been associated with various values and ideologies. Yellow, for instance, is often linked to liberalism, while black has traditionally represented anarchism or fascism — especially in Britain, where followers of the British Union of Fascists in the 1920s and 1930s were known as “Blackshirts.” For the Labour Party, the use of red was a natural choice for a group allied with trade unions, social democrats and democratic socialists. Since the French Revolution, the color has been widely associated with left-wing politics, symbolizing the blood of workers who died in the struggle against their oppressors. Upon Labour’s inception at the beginning of the 20th century, the party used a red flag as its official logo. “The color is central and symbolic to the labor movement, and has been since that period,” said Wring, noting that the party logo has since changed to a red rose. The Conservative Party, meanwhile, has historically adopted all the colors of the United Kingdom’s flag — red white and blue — in order, perhaps, to promote itself as a defender of British values. Of those three colors, an ultramarine blue emerged as its predominant shade (though the party’s current tree logo is a paler shade than some of its predecessors). Traditionally the most to produce, blue has long held connotations of wealth and conservatism. Among the smaller parties, color choices have sometimes been relatively straightforward – the Green Party uses green, unsurprisingly, due to its obvious connections with environmentalism. Others have been more pragmatic. Take the Liberal Democrats’ orange, for instance, which emerged from the combination of the two parties it was created from: the Liberal Party (yellow) and the Social Democratic Party (then associated with the red of Labour, which it broke away from in the early 1980s). Yet for the Liberal Democrats — the UK’s third largest party until the 2019 election — the color orange had another benefit: it was otherwise unclaimed. With the Scottish National Party growing in prominence in the 1970s, switching from a clashing yellow made it easier for the Lib Dems to differentiate themselves. Indeed, for recent newcomers — like the short-lived Referendum Party in the 1990s (pink), or the UK Independence Party (purple) — distinct colors may simply help them stand out in a crowded political marketplace. And while some colors have historical links, none are indelibly tied to ideologies. Elsewhere in Europe, orange is associated with both the Christian Democrats and, in the east, post-Soviet uprisings (see Ukraine’s so-called “Orange Revolution”). In other countries, green may represent Islamic parties rather than environmental ones. And while brown has longstanding links to Nazi groups, it also features prominently in the logo of the Marijuana Party of Canada. Even the simple idea that blue and red represent right and left-wing parties, respectively, is inconsistent. In the US, Democrats are blue while the more conservative Republicans are red (though before the 1988 presidential election, TV networks often did the opposite, and the current notion of “red states” and “blue states” did not come into common parlance until the 2000 presidential run-off). Of course the irony, in both the US and Britain, is that despite the color-coded campaigning, when people get to the polling booths on voting day, the various shades won’t be displayed for their final, crucial decision — that’s because the ballot papers are printed in black and white.",

    "content": "For more than fifty years, athletes competing in the have often been cheered on by either a furry, feathered or slimy friend. The mascot – a cartoonish encapsulation of the host city’s culture and history – is so important, designs are often selected and finalized years before the Games take place. According to the International Olympic Committee, the role of these quirky caricatures is to help spread a “festive atmosphere” and embody the exuberant spirit of the event. Over the decades, the world has welcomed snowmen, sasquatches, cowboy-hat-wearing bears and aliens to the Olympic stage. This year, the mascot will take the form of a hat — specifically the distinctive red Phrygian cap worn by emancipated Roman slaves which became a symbol of freedom during the French Revolution. The first mascot was created in 1968 by designer Aline Lafargue for the Grenoble Winter Games in France. Affectionately named “Shuss,” the character consists of a two-toned head and lightning-bolt shaped leg attached to skis. Despite holding the esteemed title of first ever mascot, Lafargue created and submitted her design for Shuss in just one night. To find a worthy representative, each host country will typically organize a submission call-out or contest. In 2014, a competition held by Russia in anticipation for the Sochi Winter Games received more than 24,000 drawings. The winners, a trio of arctic mammals intended to represent the three spots on the Olympic podium, were selected by a public vote with the results broadcast on Russian TV. But this hasn’t always been the case: for the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics, one of the first Olympic events to be heavily subsidized by corporate financing, Disney won the private bid for mascot design. Since these creatures are also pivotal to official merchandise, cute and cuddly have long been key metrics for any mascot’s success. Merchandise of Beijing’s for the sold “like hotcakes,” while Disney’s bald eagle, Sam, was meticulously constructed to appear short, stubby and soft as opposed to realistic, pointed and ominous in order to appeal to children. And when illustrators have deviated, viewers have let them know. Ten years ago, Iris design agency produced two silver cyclops extra-terrestrials to usher in the London Games. “If these things had been in a ’50’s horror movie it would now be considered a classic,” wrote one CNN reader in 2012. One mascot, the bear Misha, even went extra-terrestrial in 1978 when it went to space on the “Soyuz” rocket two years before the 1980 Moscow Games. Character design becomes especially important when the Games coincide with a unique moment in history. For example Sydney, Australia, the host country of the first Olympics of the millennium, commissioned three mascots for the first time in the Games’ history. The three anime-style cartoons, Syd, Olly and Millie, were named in reference to Sydney, Olympics and Millennium – and t-shirts from this landmark Games are still circulating second-hand resale sites now.",

    "content": "We’ve seen spray-on hair, a and now — marathon-winning spray-on shoes. Swiss sportswear brand On is the latest company to embrace advanced “spray-on” materials with a “revolutionary” robot-made sneaker it believes can improve performance at this month’s Olympics. The Cloudboom Strike LS is lace-free and weighs less than the latest iPhone. Designed to be more adaptable, dynamic and supportive than your average running sneakers, the $330 shoes already have a convincing track record: Kenyan runner Hellen Obiri, an Olympic silver medalist and the only woman to have won indoor, outdoor and cross-country world titles, triumphed at this year’s Boston Marathon wearing a pair. She will don them again to compete in the Paris 2024 Games this summer. Zurich-based On credits its shoes’ success to a combination of biomechanics, physiology and extreme lightness. (A men’s US size 8.5 weighs just 170g per shoe, over 100g lighter than several popular running shoes of the same size.) “More than anything, we want (the athletes) to win,” said senior director of innovation, Ilmarin Heitz, in a promotional video published Monday. “That is our gauge of success.” With no heel-cap, laces or tongue, the translucent, sock-like sneaker looks like a running shoe that has shed its skin. Its inventor, Johannes Voelchert, came up with the idea as a student after seeing a Halloween-themed hot glue gun that shot decorative spider webs. “I saw that there was a quick way of creating a textile onto a complex shape,” Voelchert, now On’s senior lead of innovation concept design, said in the brand’s video. “A shoe seemed to be the right object.” Voelchert brought his idea to the Milan Design Fair, where he caught the Swiss sportswear brand’s attention. According to On, the shoe’s uppers (the material above the sole) are made from a type of thermoplastic and colored and branded in three minutes using just a robotic arm. The upper is sprayed in one go and can be attached to the carbon-fiber and foam rubber sole using heat, not glue. The company claims its technology reduces the carbon emissions of producing a shoe’s upper by 75%, compared to its other sneaker models. The material, which it dubs LightSpray, has “the potential… to move us towards a more sustainable, circular future,” said Marc Maurer, On’s co-CEO, in a press release. The technology will be on display at a pop up in Paris later this month as people flock to the capital for the 2024 Olympic Games. And while it is not yet known if which athletes other than Obiri will wear them at the Games, a number of Olympians have recently raced in the Cloudboom Strike LS, including Australian middle-distance runner Olli Hoare. The brand told CNN via email that it hopes athletes going to Paris who have previously worn the shoes — such as Irish 1,500-meter runner Luke McCann — will “continue to choose them this summer.” On is not the first company to experiment with spray-on textiles. In October 2022, luxury French fashion house Coperni made headlines when it . The label partnered with Manel Torres, whose brand Fabrican has been producing “clothes-in-a-can” for over 20 years. Spray-on fibers have also been used in the beauty industry, with “hair in a can” solutions used to conceal bald spots and thinning hair. Having initially been made available to the public in April, the Cloudboom Strike LS will again go on sale to consumers later this year.",

    "content": "A specific shade of retina-singeing chartreuse has become the defining color of summer 2024. Similar to the text message bubble sent from your iPhone, the vivid hue sits somewhere between 360 and 375 on the Pantone color chart. It is, of course, Brat green. Now synonymous with British pop star Charli XCX’s chart-topping studio album, green knows no bounds. Last week, the official X account of the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority alerted commuters of train repairs using a “Brat” green graphic. 65-year-old Golden Globe-winning actor Kyle McLachlan posted an of himself lip syncing to a track from the album in a fluorescent green shirt. It has even crept into Vice President Kamala Harris’ universe. After President Joe Biden announced he would no longer be seeking re-election and instead endorsing Kamala Harris, Charli XCX took to X to offer her own seal of approval, proclaiming: “kamala IS brat.” Memes swiftly followed, as well as t-shirts with Harris’ name printed in the style of the “Brat” album cover. Even the Vice President’s official rapid response account on X, @kamalahq, is now topped with a “Brat” style banner. The hashtag #Bratsummer has been tagged in over 40,000 videos on TikTok and 12,000 posts on Instagram. The term has also been on a steady incline worldwide, according to Google Trends, since the first week of June. Google even predicts searches for “Brat summer” will reach their maximum popularity this week. The term “Brat girl summer” can be understood best as a battle cry — uniting all hedonists, fun-lovers and “365 Party Girls.” Last month, Charli XCX outlined the ingredients for a Brat girl summer to the BBC, citing “a pack of cigs, a Bic lighter and a strappy white top with no bra.” Some might consider Kamala Harris becoming the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead a major party ticket as Brat, because it’s boundary-breaking, feminine and intersectional. At its core, embracing Brat culture is about messy, imperfect self-acceptance — and it’s the easiest way right now to engage the under-30 demographic. As a result, the past weeks have become awash with lurid green, and fast. “It used to be that brands picked a color, but then it would be years before somebody associates that color with your brand,” said Sunita Yeomans, leader of the Graphic Branding and Identity course at London College of Communication, in a video interview. Yeoman believes Charli XCX has managed to fast-track the process with “spectacular” success. She recently noticed a colleague was inadvertently wearing Brat green during an art gallery board meeting. “I thought, ‘Oh my God, she doesn’t even realize she’s wearing that color.’ It got me thinking about when people don’t even realize that they’re endorsing (something).” This isn’t the first summer to have been color-coded by pop culture, either; it’s the second in a row. Last year, to see Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” film, and it also hit red carpets and shaded music videos including Pinterest searches for “Barbie pink” in both the US and UK were up 100% in 2023 compared to 2024, and fashion search engine Lyst named pink their trend of the year in 2022, thanks to a 416% increase in searches for hot pink clothing. But what goes into creating an era-defining shade? “Color is a language,” said Laurie Pressman, vice president of Pantone. “We gravitate towards color, and our relationship with color oftentimes happens outside of our consciousness.” The color authority was partly responsible for the months before the film even premiered. For , Pressman and her team collaborated with Pier Paolo Piccioli, the fashion house’s creative director at the time, for the hue “Pink PP” (colloquially known as “Valentino pink”) — the sole color used in the collection. It became the shade du jour: in a sheer tulle Valentino Pink number for the label’s haute couture show in that July; while earlier in the year, not one but three celebrities arrived at the Met Gala dressed in the shade. “(Piccioli)  wanted this (color) to be a cultural touchstone,” Pressman told CNN in a video interview, adding that it’s “about being bold” and “standing out.” And, as a sister shade to red, she pointed out, it expanded the brand’s legacy with the color Rosso Valentino. Although Pantone were also the ones who standardized 219C — better known as Barbie pink — in the 1990s, Pressman insists Valentino pink’s serendipitous overlap with the “Barbie” marketing machine was “a complete coincidence.” Plus, the two shades are different, with Barbie pink being “a little bit more neon,” she said. While Barbie pink has a long, storied history, Brat green is fresh out the gates. It was created by design studio Special Offer Inc., who spent months discussing the shade, eventually selecting Brat green from around 500 options, according to founder Brent David Freaney. “Charli knew exactly what she wanted, probably long before she even engaged with us,” Freaney told CNN in a phone interview. “We spent months just talking about color and color references. ‘What does this shade of green mean versus this shade of green? What’s the connotation?’” While walking around New York City, Freaney would stop to take photos of any green object that might fit in the ‘bratosphere’ — a term coined by Charli XCX herself. “Then I’d take (these pictures) to my computer and use the (Photoshop) eyedropper tool to make that green and present it. Like, ‘I saw this traffic cone outside. What do we think about that?’” For Yeoman, the science of a summer-stealing color mostly boils down to how a shade performs online and IRL. “If you look at Brat green on a screen, it zings,” she said. “Barbie pink does the same thing. It’s about finding a shade that works both when it’s backlit on a screen and also in real life.” Freaney says they didn’t want a shade that felt conventional. “We knew we didn’t want a darker green or a mint green,” he told CNN. “We were like, ‘Let’s choose something that feels really off-putting.” Because of the color’s specificity, spotting it out in the wild — much like Freaney’s research process — has become a surefire way to go viral and add to the bratosphere. Stephanie, a Charli XCX fan based in New York, created the Instagram account in June, just after the album’s release, and now receives photo submissions of Brat green sightings from friends and other fans. Her posts include a stack of Lime bikes, an estate sale poster and a pyromorphite mineral in a science museum. “It’s just so fun,” she told CNN over email. “Every time I’m with a friend walking on the street someone stops to yell, ‘Brat!’ when we see anything green. It’s so iconic and eye-catching — if you see anything online with that color you immediately know what it’s referencing.” Though Pantone has been quietly creating specific shades for musicians for decades — Pressman has standardized everything from Rolling Stones red to Prince purple, though it’s up to brands if they want to enter into the elusive trademarking process themselves — Pressman thinks both artists and audiences are increasingly paying attention to color. The specific shade of lavender Olivia Rodrgio has worn on several red carpets, , is the same hue of her latest album “Guts,” and the color of most of her merchandise. Ice Spice, too, has become synonymous with her mop of fiery orange hair — and often matches her step-and-repeat looks to the shade. “Some of these very young artists who are really looking to express themselves and are turning to color as one more way to get their message out,” Pressman said. “Which I think is very savvy.” Brat green might have claimed this summer, but the color wheel will spin again before long. “That’s just the way the design industry works,” said Yeomans, who believes more labels will scramble to brand summer 2025. “Everyone always catches onto a trend, and then everyone tries to do it, but only a handful will actually succeed.”",

    "content": "For nearly a decade and a half, New Yorkers have awaited the arrival of a self-filtering, cross-shaped pool floating in the city’s East River after the proposal was partially crowdfunded and by the city. Now the futuristic design has an official home. Last week, Governor Kathy Hochul and Mayor Eric Adams announced that the summertime facility, called + POOL, will be built at Pier 35, near Manhattan’s Lower East Side — though swimmers may need to wait until summer 2026 for opening day. The pool’s filtration system, which is expected to clean more than a million gallons of river water daily without the use of chemicals or additives, per a project press release, will undergo two rounds of testing. The first will begin this month on a floating barge in the waters close to Pier 35; next year, a portion of the open-air pool will be built to carry out the final tests. This past January, Governor Hochul announced a major breakthrough for the project by way of $16 million in joint city and state funding, part of a statewide $150 million initiative called NY SWIMS. Mayor Adams said in a that + POOL will help expand “equitable access to swimming for all New Yorkers, especially our children.” The city of more than 8.3 million people only maintains around 50 public pools deep enough to swim in, according to New York City Council data from 2022, creating long lines during summers amid longer . Originally the idea of architect Dong-Ping Wong, who collaborated with designers from the creative studio PlayLab and the now-defunct firm Family, + POOL was conceived as an ambitious and eye-catching way to open the city’s waterways for public use. Once built, the 9,000-square-foot cross-shaped pool will be able to accommodate up to 300 swimmers at a time and can be divided into four for activities such as children’s swimming, lounging, laps and sports. The design can also be configured lengthwise to offer Olympic-sized lanes, or the four “arms” of the cross can be connected into a single large pool. Layers of “filtration membranes” will not only make the water safe for swimming but will clean the surrounding river, too, according to Friends of + POOL, the nonprofit organization that the designers co-founded in 2015 as they expanded their team and appointed new board members. The pool was the first civic architecture proposal to launch through Kickstarter, according to the project, which over $300,000 through the crowdfunding site between 2011 and 2014 to fund testing. An early estimate in 2011 put the total cost of the project at $21 million, though Kara Meyer, managing director of Friends of + POOL, told CNN over email that this figure has since increased to around $50 million, with a more detailed cost estimate still to come. “One of the most beautiful things about this project is that it has truly been community-driven,” Meyer said. “We kickstarted the project with thousands of small donations and the nonprofit continues to raise small-level funds from a vast array of community members that want access to their rivers and believe in the work we are doing around water safety education and water stewardship.” But, following Governor Hochul’s announcement in January, Wong wrote an Instagram post expressing various concerns, including a “lack of diversity” on the + POOL board. While he welcomed the $16 million funding as “a huge and commendable commitment from the City and State,” he questioned whether the public facility would properly serve the nearby Chinatown community, “the majority of whom are people of color and lower income,” he explained. After last week’s announcement, Wong told CNN in an email that he has been replaced on the project by other architects. Meyer refuted the claim he had been “frozen out,” telling CNN the project had evolved beyond the design stage, which Wong had “focused on,” to encompass engineering, programming and advocacy work. “From the organization’s perspective, up until he declared publicly he was not, he was always a key part of the project,” said Meyer. Wong’s name still appears on the +POOL website. Meyer added that four of the nonprofit’s 10 board members “identify as women and people of color,” and pointed to the organization’s community partnerships, including free swim lessons for local schoolchildren and workforce programs for residents, who she said will be trained for roles in lifeguarding, filtration system maintenance and water-quality testing, among others. “Considering the horrific history of racial discrimination that has impacted America’s public pools, our commitment to accountability to the community and providing access where it’s lacking guides all of our decisions with the communities we serve,” she said. Though New Yorkers should see the pool taking shape off of Pier 35 as testing finishes up next year, an exact timeline for its completion is yet to be announced. By helping filter a historically polluted river, organizers hope the project will offer “new frameworks” for the city to make use of its rivers in creative ways.",

    "title": "\n      The VW Beetle evokes memories of years gone by, but in Mexico it’s still part of the present\n    ",

    "publication_date": "2024-08-25T08:28:25.352Z",

    "content": "﻿In today’s world of autonomous cars, keyless ignitions and charging ports, it’s hard to imagine just how the tiny, two-door Volkswagen Beetle once was. But in Mexico, where the last Beetle rolled off the production line at Volkswagen’s flagship factory in Puebla in 2003, the plucky car lives on. Reinvented and reinvigorated by its cultural legacy, Mexico is one of the few remaining places where a taste of Beetle-fever still exists. The car’s curvy, colorful exterior and air-cooled, rear engine propelled it to a level of fame and cult status which no petrol car will achieve again. While fond stories of the lovable vehicle roam in our memories, what was has all but disappeared from American roads, consigned to automotive museums and collector’s forecourts. Patrolling the sprawling streets of Mexico City, traversing hair-raising mountain roads in Oaxaca’s Sierra Norte, and operating as a converted food truck serving Mexican delicacies, the “Vocho,” as the Beetle is known in Mexico, never left the stage. Moments before he was interrupted by the signature rumble of a Vocho arriving at the largest Volkswagen event in the central Mexican state of Hidalgo, President of the ‘Ixmi Volks Club’, Jesus Delgado told CNN: “When I hear a Vocho’s engine, I see my wife waving goodbye to me on her way to the shops. I see the excitement on my son’s face as I took him for his first driving lesson.” Delgado’s wife died of Covid in 2020, and his sons are all grown up, but according to him, “the emotional memories feel even more real when he’s around the car.” The first Beetle arrived on Mexican shores in 1954 as part of an exhibition to showcase Germany’s industrial growth. Sales were increasing slowly in the United States, but Volkswagen was battling against post-war anti-German sentiment for the car, which had been conceived under Adolf Hitler’s direction in 1934. Hitler had entrusted the job of manufacturing a small, affordable car to carmaker Ferdinand Porsche, but the outbreak of World War II halted commercial production. It didn’t restart until 1945, when allied forces discovered the bombed-out remains of a car factory in northern Germany, where a lone Volkswagen Beetle was parked amongst the rubble. It took a spark of brilliance from Jewish-American advertising executive Julian Koenig for Volkswagen’s tides to change. Alongside his team of sharp-suited Madison Avenue ad-men, he launched their legendary minimalist advertising campaign “Thinking Small”, which shifted the American public away from expensive family wagons to a new reality of small, more fuel-efficient and affordable cars for the masses. But nobody could have predicted the Beetle’s improbable evolution into a counterculture symbol and talisman of the flower power movement in the US. As the Vietnam War raged, the Beetle had grown to embody a powerful social movement spawned from anti-war protests across America, and then continued to represent “peace and love” throughout the era, as Beetles arrived in droves at Woodstock Festival 1969. It was an underdog, unapologetically simple and a symbol of anti-capitalist structures lovingly embraced by hippie countercultures. It had, in many ways, grown to represent everything that Nazi Germany would have hated. By 1972, it was the world’s most-produced car benefiting from the mainstream fame of Disney’s “The Love Bug” and a strong supply chain which included a new factory in Puebla, Mexico, from where it was shipped around the world. By the time Volkswagen called time on the car’s production in 2003 due to declining sales and a desire to build more modern alternatives, the Beetle had been manufactured in Mexico for more years than it had in Germany. Shortly after the announcement, that “it has become obvious that its heritage will remain vibrant.” But since then, tougher air pollution laws and rising fuel costs have gradually taken it off the roads of Europe and in the United States, where the car is serving its final stately chapter away from the public eye, holding its own as a toy for the rich and famous. Actor, Chris Pratt restored his own 1965 Beetle back in 2016 describing it “as a dream to roll through the Hollywood hills in.” In the same year, comedian, Jerry Seinfeld sold his white 1960 model, equipped with a 36hp engine for $121,000, setting a world record for a Beetle sale. Three years later, fellow Hollywood star, Ewan McGregor spent over $30,000 to convert his Beetle to become fully electric. But in Mexico, you’re never far from catching a glimpse of the original car signature’s curves and rear engine growl. Jose Luis, who has been restoring Vochos for 40 years, described how he was “deeply saddened” when the decision was made to stop producing the car. He argued, that “although parts are now more expensive and much harder to find, the appetite for people to own and drive them in Mexico remains unchanged.” For world-renowned Mexican visual artist, Betsabeé Romero, the car has been instrumental in her career. In her studio in the outskirts of Mexico City, Romero is perched next to one of five hollowed out Vocho shells she will shortly meld together to create a bridge representing the migrant journey. “The Vocho is a symbol of our heritage and one we can all relate to,” she said. “Every car is a piece of design history; it is uniquely democratic… Many people might have a favorite building but not know the architect or enjoy a style of art but couldn’t tell you about who or when it was created. That’s not the case with the car. We all have a favorite, and we each have a story to tell about it.” Modern carmakers face a huge challenge in creating a car which can garner a similar level of global attention, but whether it will ever be possible to recreate the Volkswagen Beetle’s unparalleled cult-status remains to be seen.",

    "content": "In the last two years, tennis has taken over our closets (court-appropriate garb can be found everywhere from Skims to Miu Miu), our screens (who could forget Zendaya’s turn as the tennis protogé-turned-elite-coach Tashi Duncan in “Challengers”) and now — our living rooms. At least that is the hope of Belgian eco-designer Mathilde Wittock, who fashions bespoke furniture from discarded tennis balls. Wittock’s sleek, modernist chaise longues are entirely cushionless — save for the padding of 500 precisely arranged tennis balls. Her one meter-long benches are similarly sparse, with some 270 balls being both stylish and structurally substantial. “It takes around 24 different manufacturing steps to (make) a tennis ball, which is around five days. Then it has such a short lifespan,” Wittock told CNN in a video call from Brussels. “I was looking into tennis balls because I played tennis myself, so I know there is a lot of waste.” balls are produced each year — and almost all of them end up in landfills, taking over 400 years to decompose. The US Open, which ended at the weekend, goes through , with Wimbledon not far behind at . Wittock estimates the lifecycle of a ball stands at just nine games, depending on the level of tennis being played. “Even if they are contained in their box, if the box has been opened the gas inside the tennis balls will be released over time,” she said. “(Eventually) they will get flat and you’ll have to throw them away.” It takes Wittock around three to four weeks to build a chair, which she sells for $2,900. Every ball is cut and dyed by hand, with colors picked out especially to fit the client’s space. It was through much trial and error that she was able to harness the shape of the ball while masking some of its all-too-easily recognized features. “I needed to find an assembly that changed the iconic appearance of the tennis balls,” she said. “It’s yellow and has these white lines. How do I distort that relationship?” Wittock started to see the design possibilities of the sporting equipment when she was studying at Central Saint Martins art school in London. “I was really interested in eco-design and where I sourced my material,” she told CNN. “And I realized that it was always very complicated to follow the history of materials. You never know where they come from, or how they’ve been processed. I got really angry at that.” Today, she receives all her materials via donations from tennis clubs. Collections began small — sometimes with just 10 tossed balls at a time — but quickly grew. Now, Wittock works with the Federation of Wallonia in Brussels, who have offered her their entire stock — around 100,000. How long will it last? “It’s enough for a few months,” she said. “If things get wild. Maybe nine months, because I have a rhythm of cutting tennis balls. I can get through 1,800 per week.” But creation isn’t the only goal. In fact, more important to Wittock is how her pieces are destroyed. “I’m an eco designer,” she said. “Eco design is about circularity. You can use great materials that are low carbon emission or recycled, but you need to think of the end cycle. If it’s not a circle, and if you can’t reuse (the elements) into something else, it’s not eco design. It’s even worse, because it’s new materials.” At the end of her furniture’s life, Wittock can de-assemble the hundreds of tennis balls (which are woven together without glue) to be recycled, where the fuzz is burnt off and the rubber shredded to make bouncy playground mats. Her next challenge? Tapping into the in North America. “I’ve got so many people interested in the US,” said Wittock. “I’m really thinking of coming over and starting recycling there.” So next time you watch a tournament, don’t lament the abandoned balls — their lifecycle might just be beginning.",

    "content": "has taken a step forward in its ambitious plan to land astronauts on the – unveiling the specially designed spacesuit its crew will don for what’s expected to be a landmark mission in the . The new red-and-white suit – revealed by the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) over the weekend – is made to withstand the moon’s extreme temperatures, as well as radiation and dust, while allowing astronauts physical flexibility to perform tasks on the lunar surface, according to state media. The moon-landing suit is equipped with a built-in long and short-range camera, an operations console, and a glare-proof helmet visor, according to a video shared by state broadcaster CCTV, which featured well-known Chinese astronauts Zhai Zhigang and Wang Yaping demonstrating how astronauts wearing the suit can bend and climb a ladder. The new technology has caught international attention. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk shared a on the platform X featuring the CCTV video and his own caption. “Meanwhile, back in America, the [Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)] is smothering the national space program in kafkaesque paperwork!” he wrote, in an apparent reference to the perceived speed with which China has bolstered its space program relative to the US. CNN has reached out to FAA for comment. SpaceX’s fortunes – and Musk’s personal wealth – have been boosted in recent years by huge government contracts as NASA has sought to tap into the private sector on space exploration and logistics. China’s reveal of the moon-landing spacesuit comes as the country has mounted a significant effort to establish itself a major player in space – a domain that nations, including the United States, are increasingly looking to not only for scientific benefit, but also with an eye to and . The China National Space Administration has in recent years carried out a series of increasingly complex robotic lunar missions, including the from the far side of the moon earlier this year. It has been angling to become the second country to land astronauts on the moon, saying its first crewed mission will take place “by 2030.” The US, which has not sent astronauts to the moon since 1972, is also planning to send a crew this decade, though it has delayed its initial timeline for its That mission will not take off until at least September 2026, NASA said earlier this year. The agency a protoype of its Artemis III spacesuit prototype, the AxEMU, in 2023. China’s new spacesuit was hailed across state media as a major step forward in the country’s crewed mission timeline, with experts noting the need for specifically formulated suit for lunar conditions versus those used in spacewalks by astronauts at China’s Tiangong orbital space station. Thanks to its thin exosphere, the moon is an unforgiving place, exposed to both the sun’s rays and the cold of space. Temperatures near the Moon’s equator, for example, can spike to 250°F (121°C) in the day and then plunge at night to -208°F (-133°C), according to NASA. “Unlike low-Earth orbit missions, astronauts will be in a harsh natural lunar environment during lunar extravehicular activities. Complex environmental factors such as high vacuum and low gravity, lunar dust and lunar soil, complex lunar surface terrain, high and low temperatures, and strong radiation will have a significant impact on work and protection,” Wu Zhiqiang, deputy chief designer of astronaut systems at the China Astronaut Research and Training Center, told state broadcaster CCTV. Others also hailed the aesthetics of the suit, with state media describing the red stripes on its upper limbs are inspired by ribbons from the “flying apsaras,” or deities that appear in ancient art in western China’s Dunhuang city, while those on its lower limbs resembling “rocket launch flames.” Another designer, Wang Chunhui, told state media the suit’s proportions would make the astronauts “look more spirited and majestic” and “make us Chinese look strong and beautiful when we step on the moon.” Earlier this year, Chinese officials released the name of the spacecraft for the crewed lunar mission – with the spaceship dubbed Mengzhou, or Dream Vessel, the lander, Lanyue, or Embracing the Moon. The mission is designed as part of a broader set of lunar ambitions, which include China’s plans to establish an international lunar research station at the moon’s south pole by 2040.",

    "content": "Japanese toymaker MegaHouse has unveiled a miniature Rubik’s Cube — one so tiny that you might need a pair of tweezers to solve it. Each face of the cube, which is made from aluminum, measures about five millimeters (around 0.2 inches) across. It was made available for pre-order on the manufacturer’s website on Thursday, with deliveries expected next April. “The 5-milimeter Rubik’s Cube is the result of the trinity of machines, cutting tools, and players’ passion,” said Kiyokazu Saito, president of Iriso Precision, the company brought in for the precision cutting, in a promotional video on the toymaker’s website. Weighing just 0.3 grams (about 0.01 ounces), the puzzle is about a 1,000th of the size of the original, which measures around 2.2 inches across each face. And each side of the nine squares on the device’s six faces measures just 1.6 millimeters (around 0.06 inches). MegaHouse told CNN that the company started conceptualizing it four years ago and began the process to produce it in 2022. Guinness World Record confirmed the micro-cube as the world’s smallest rotating puzzle cube in August. The miniature model breaks the record set by British puzzle designer Tony Fisher in 2016, when he startled fans with a 5.6-milimeter version. But the price tag suggests it’s likely to be a collector’s item rather than the kind of cube that players fiddle with on the go. They are being sold at 777,777 yen ($5,320), and each comes with a stand declaring it the “World’s record smallest Rubik’s Cube.” The release coincides with the 50th anniversary of the rotating puzzle, which counts amateur hobbyists and professional mathematicians among its huge following. Over 500 million cubes have been sold since Hungarian inventor Ernő Rubik created it in 1974. Tournaments are held around the world every year with participants vying for the title of fastest puzzle-solver over fractions of a second. The current record-holder for a standard 3x3x3 cube is 22-year-old Korean American , who solved the Rubik’s Cube in 3.13 seconds at a competition in Long Beach, California last year, followed by 10-year-old Wang Yiheng from China, who achieved his personal best of 3.38 seconds at a competition in his home country in August, according to the World Cube Association. The standard 3x3x3 category, one of the most competitive in the Rubik’s Cube community, is currently dominated by the two countries, with the US’s Luke Garrett and Aaron Huynh coming third and fourth, respectively, and China’s Du Yusheng ranked fifth.",

    "content": "She weighs three apples and stands five apples tall. She enjoys baking cookies and dreams of being a pianist or poet. And now, despite her ageless appearance, she is 50 years old. Friday marks half a century since Japanese merchandising company Sanrio created the first iteration of Kitty White, or Hello Kitty, a cheerful feline girl (not, as her creator controversially in 2014, a cat) who lives with her family in London’s suburbs. In the decades since debuting, she has become a UNICEF ambassador, a special envoy for Japan’s Foreign Ministry and the subject of themed restaurants, cafes, two amusement parks and even a maternity hospital. As such, Hello Kitty is also a commercial behemoth that has earned her creator an estimated $80 billion, placing her alongside Pokémon, Mickey Mouse and Winnie-the-Pooh as history’s top-grossing franchises. Unlike others on the list, however, merchandise wasn’t a profitable extension of Hello Kitty’s on-screen popularity — it was her from the start. Designed to adorn children’s items and stationery, she was first drawn by Yuko Shimizu, one of Sanrio’s in-house illustrators, in 1974. The company wanted designs embodying “kawaii,” a Japanese term for cuteness, and the 24-year-old’s cat-like creation was a kitten her father had given her as a gift. Hello Kitty made her commercial debut the next year, appearing on a line of vinyl coin purses alongside several other new characters. She proved, by far, to be the company’s most popular new design. Sanrio’s sales soared almost immediately as her image was pasted onto toys, stickers and much else. But if the character’s early success can be attributed to Shimizu’s simple, memorable design — comprising a mouthless face, oval yellow nose, whiskers and a bow — her status as a pop culture icon is thanks to illustrator Yuko Yamaguchi. Considered Hello Kitty’s third designer (Shimizu left Sanrio three years after inventing the character and was replaced by Setsuko Yonekubo, who briefly oversaw the design in the late 1970s) Yamaguchi has steered the character’s visual identity for almost 45 years. Speaking to CNN at Sanrio’s Tokyo headquarters, she recalled joining the company at a time when Hello Kitty products were declining in popularity. In 1979, Sanrio decided to revitalize the brand, and Yamaguchi was one of several illustrators tasked with creating and presenting new imagery. Aware that Hello Kitty was an aspiring musician, she drew a scene envisaging the character surrounded by her family after receiving her first grand piano. “Even though Hello Kitty says she wants to be a pianist, she had never been depicted playing the piano,” she said, adding: “I was asked to be the designer of Hello Kitty on the spot.” Yamaguchi started meeting with Hello Kitty’s fans, past and present, to understand why sales were down. She also made a formative year-long visit to San Francisco in 1984, amid a booming US interest in teddy bears. After returning to Japan, Yamaguchi began creating new drawings and a cast of friends for Hello Kitty — including the teddy bear, Tiny Chum. “I wanted Hello Kitty to become more energetic,” she said. “And since she was the face of Sanrio, and was born as a symbol of friendship, I wanted to make lots of friends for her.” While Hello Kitty’s key features remained largely unchanged, Yamaguchi (who previously told that the character doesn’t have a mouth “so that people who look at her can project their own feelings onto her face”) placed her in different scenarios, broadening her appeal. “She’s good at sports, and she looks cute and chic too,” she explained. “I think of her as a blank canvas that you can transform into all sorts of things. There’s not much that doesn’t suit her… I think that when everyone talks to Hello Kitty, she probably answers them in some way.” Sales of Hello Kitty products flourished in Japan between the 1980s and mid-1990s. Much of the company’s earlier merchandise was aimed at young girls, including school supplies and personal care items like toothbrushes. But, even then, illustrator Yamaguchi knew the character would need to evolve and grow with her fans. It’s a realization the illustrator traces back to a letter she received from a fan in 1987: “She was a big fan of Hello Kitty but, in the letter, she wrote that her friends and parents had told her that it is a children’s character, and that she should have outgrown it. But she didn’t want to, so she asked me to make products for high school students like her.” Inspired by the trends she saw in Tokyo’s at the time, Yamaguchi began incorporating contemporary style into her designs, in the hope of appealing to older fans.  In 1999, Sanrio told the New York Times that the character was appearing on 12,000 new product lines a year, spanning almost every category imaginable, from clothing to board games, greeting cards to lunchboxes. The company also began using Hello Kitty on more adult items, like electronics and kitchen appliances, as it became clear that nostalgia was becoming a major selling point. As a result, some of today’s biggest Hello Kitty fans are those who grew up with her in the 1980s and ‘90s. Among them is Asako Kanda, who started collecting Sanrio products in third grade and now owns over 10,000 items adorned with the character’s expressionless face. “My mother gave me Hello Kitty stationery and school supplies like pencil cases and plastic boards. When I saw them, I thought they were so cute, and they quickly became my favorite. That’s where it started,” she said, showing CNN around a dedicated Hello Kitty room in her Tokyo home. “Once I began buying things for myself, I could get items for the kitchen, bathroom and other daily necessities. I wanted to unify everything with Hello Kitty from that point on. After more than 36 years of collecting, Kanda still buys around two Hello Kitty items every month. Sanrio releases new products on a weekly basis, and she scans them looking for anything that is “memorable or cute.” “As life goes on, there are times when you face unpleasant or sad experiences,” she said, “During those times, looking at Hello Kitty goods have brought me comfort and solace.” As Japan’s economy stagnated in the 1990s, Sanrio expanded its international presence. In Hello Kitty’s early years, the company had sold products door-to-door in the US, before setting up the first overseas branch of its retail store, Gift Gate, in San Jose in 1976. But following an explosion of Western interest in Japanese culture — from “Dragon Ball Z” to Tamagotchis and Beyblade — she captured the imagination of American consumers around the turn of the millennium, according to Atsuo Nakayama, a Japanese sociologist specializing in the entertainment industry. “Just after 9/11, the world was changing,” he told CNN. “And I think that the Japanese ‘kawaii’ culture was an alternative fit for America, somehow.” Much of Hello Kitty’s commercial success has been achieved through licensing. She has spawned books, video games and animated TV series, like the long-running “Hello Kitty and Friends,” which helped further develop her character. (Although, despite being raised in London, she was given a North American accent in English dubbed versions.) She has also been part of deals with major consumer and luxury brands, and has appeared on an EVA Air plane, Fender Stratocaster guitars and Swarovski jewelry. And while Sanrio’s declining fortunes at the turn of the 2010s sparked fears that Hello Kitty’s cultural relevance was fading, the company’s share price has rocketed in the last two years. It now stands over 10 times its Covid-era low. According to Atsuo, nostalgia is once again a key driving force — at home in Japan, and abroad. “Hello Kitty is on the rise again in America, and I think that this is because the first generation have now become parents and passed (their interests) on to their children,” Atsuo said, adding:  “(Her popularity) has risen and fallen many times like this, and it creates a regular opportunity for people who were captivated by Hello Kitty to remember it and want to collect it again.” Sanrio’s recent successes are also, in part, due to it diversifying from Hello Kitty. The character now only accounts for around 30% of Sanrio’s gross profit in product sales and licensing, down from 76% a decade earlier, according to the . Recent creations like Gudetama (a lazy egg yolk) and Aggressive Retsuko (an introverted death-metal-loving red panda) have both featured in their own Netflix series. Yet, even as Sanrio’s business model changes, Yamaguchi believes Hello Kitty will endure. “Of course, there are many characters in the world that have been around longer than Hello Kitty,” the illustrator said, adding: “I hope she continues working hard so she can celebrate her 100th anniversary in 50 years’ time.” CNN’s Genta Takeda contributed to this story.",

    "content": "The world’s first , built by Japanese researchers, was launched into space on Tuesday, in an early test of using timber in lunar and Mars exploration. LignoSat, developed by Kyoto University and homebuilder Sumitomo Forestry, will be flown to the International Space Station on a SpaceX mission, and later released into orbit about 400 kilometers (250 miles) above the Earth. Named after the Latin word for “wood,” the palm-sized LignoSat is tasked to demonstrate the cosmic potential of the renewable material as humans explore living in space. “With timber, a material we can produce by ourselves, we will be able to build houses, live and work in space forever,” said Takao Doi, an astronaut who has flown on the Space Shuttle and studies human space activities at Kyoto University. With a 50-year plan of planting trees and building timber houses on the moon and Mars, Doi’s team decided to develop a NASA-certified wooden satellite to prove wood is a space-grade material. “Early 1900s airplanes were made of wood,” said Kyoto University forest science professor Koji Murata. “A wooden satellite should be feasible, too.” Wood is more durable in space than on Earth because there’s no water or oxygen that would rot or inflame it, Murata added. A wooden satellite also minimizes the environmental impact at the end of its life, the researchers say. Decommissioned satellites must re-enter the atmosphere to avoid becoming space debris. Conventional metal satellites create aluminum oxide particles during re-entry, but wooden ones would just burn up with less pollution, Doi said. “Metal satellites might be banned in the future,” Doi said. “If we can prove our first wooden satellite works, we want to pitch it to Elon Musk’s SpaceX.” The researchers found that honoki, a kind of magnolia tree native in Japan and traditionally used for sword sheaths, is most suited for spacecraft, after a 10-month experiment aboard the International Space Station. LignoSat is made of honoki, using a traditional Japanese crafts technique without screws or glue. Once deployed, LignoSat will stay in the orbit for six months, with the electronic components onboard measuring how wood endures the extreme environment of space, where temperatures fluctuate from -100 to 100 degrees Celsius (-148 to 212 degrees Fahrenheit) every 45 minutes as it orbits from darkness to sunlight. LignoSat will also gauge wood’s ability to reduce the impact of space radiation on semiconductors, making it useful for applications such as data center construction, said Kenji Kariya, a manager at Sumitomo Forestry Tsukuba Research Institute. “It may seem outdated, but wood is actually cutting-edge technology as civilisation heads to the moon and Mars,” he said. “Expansion to space could invigorate the timber industry.”",

    "content": "How do you bring to life one of the most beloved Latin American towns — one that has a century of history, but never existed at all? That was the task facing the production team of “One Hundred Years of Solitude” (or “Cien Años de Soledad”), the long-awaited Netflix adaptation of a novel widely lauded as being among the 20th century’s greatest literary works. Written in 1967 by the Nobel Prize-winning Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez, the book follows seven generations of the Buendía family, who follow cyclical paths of obsession, yearning, idealism and detachment, and are tied inextricably to the fate of their home, Macondo. From one of the first scenes, as Colonel Aureliano Buendía faces down a firing squad against a bloodied, white stucco wall on a clear day, viewers are transported into Macondo, an isolated riverside settlement that flourishes into a prosperous town before confronting war and colonialist exploitation. As one of the most famous works in the magical realism genre, the book’s setting teems with the supernatural and the dreamlike, though they are treated as everyday occurrences. Early on, an insomnia plague sinks residents into a haze of short-term memory loss; later, a single trickle of blood turns corners, crosses streets and climbs curbs to alert the family matriarch, Úrsula, of a shocking death. Before his death in 2014, García Márquez credited his storytelling style to that of his grandmother, who talked of fantastic things “with complete naturalness.” “What was most important was the expression she had on her face,” he told in 1981. “In previous attempts to write ‘One Hundred Years of Solitude,’ I tried to tell the story without believing in it. I discovered that what I had to do was believe in them myself and write them with the same expression with which my grandmother told them: with a brick face.” Macondo has never been found on any map — though it might have, had an ill-fated 2006 proposal to of Marquez’s birthplace, Aracataca, succeeded — but it has lived in the minds of readers for decades. It is also steeped in real Colombian history. Because of that, the Netflix show, which will span two seasons and premieres on December 11, was filmed exclusively in the country and is entirely in Spanish. The show also has the blessing of the author’s family, with García Márquez’s sons, Rodrigo Garcia and Gonzalo Garcia Barcha, serving as executive producers. Production involved building meticulous town-sized sets and creating faithful costumes from the 1800s and 1900s. “‘One Hundred Years of Solitude’ occurs during a specific time in Colombian history,” said production designer Bárbara Enríquez in a translated video call with CNN. “We treated it as a period piece.” Enríquez took over production design in 2022, after Eugenio Caballero, best known for his Academy Award-winning “Pan’s Labyrinth” sets, stepped down from the project. (Caballero and Enríquez previously worked together on Alfonso Cuáron’s Academy Award-winning “Roma” in 2018). The production of “One Hundred Years of Solitude” is one of the largest in Latin American history, according to Netflix, and required the building of three different towns. The first served as the unnamed village of mud huts and bamboo, where cousins José Arcadio Buendía and Úrsula Iguarán grow up and marry one another before leading part of their community on an exodus across mountain ranges and disorienting swamplands to establish Macondo. Then, there were two versions of Macondo itself: the simple thatched homes and dirt roads of its early years, followed by the verdant streets and elegant multi-story homes that develop as the town becomes increasingly connected with the outside world. Magical realism is “actually just reality wherein magical things occur,” Enríquez said. “From the set design perspective, what we wanted to do was a very rigorous historical set, so that we could then insert the extraordinary parts within the ordinary.” But that didn’t mean that individual props couldn’t evoke a sense of wonder. Take the first significant prop seen in the show — the parchment book in which gypsy character Melquíades writes, in Sanskrit, the entirety of Macondo’s history (which becomes the novel itself). To create it, the production team worked with a Sanskrit translator who adapted the the full text, as well as a calligrapher who worked on the giant tome, according to Enríquez. Then there’s the first block of ice ever seen in Macondo, brought in by traveling gypsies, that stays in Aureliano’s memories for the rest of his life. Presented like an enormous, glittering diamond in a gold chest, which erupts into fog when opened and casts a soft light onto José Arcadio and his two sons, the indelible ice was real. “It was so important to have the authentic look and feel, and so that when (young Aureliano) touched the ice, the actor’s reaction was authentic,” recalled Enríquez. At the figurative center of the town is the Buendía household, ever expanding to accommodate the needs of its revolving members. Its bedrooms are filled with lovelorn characters coming of age and finding intimacy beneath their mosquito nets; its alchemic laboratory hosts the obsessive scientific experiments of patriarch José Arcadio and Melquíades. Then there’s Aureliano’s metal workshop for his meticulous crafting of gold fish, which were custom-made for the show. And, when the young girls Amaranta and Rebeca grow up, the Buendías’ parlor is transformed by music, as the Italian Pietro Crespi brings in a pianola and a delicate music box (also custom-made) that enraptures the household. Fittingly, Enríquez and her team treat the house as a character in and of itself. “The house is just another Buendia,” she remarked — one that changes its mood as well. “When Úrsula is happy, the house is happy. When Úrsula is depressed, the house looks depressed. When the town goes to war, the house goes to war,” Enríquez said. In decorating the light-filled, airy abode, Enríquez’s team sourced an enormous trove of antique furniture. The producers also worked with Indigenous communities across Colombia, including artisans from the Zenú people, in Córdoba, who created woven baskets for the show, and the Chimila people, in Magdalena, who created traditional hammocks called chinchorros. “We were able to use objects and materials that were not only true to the time period, but also true to the Indigenous people,” Enríquez said. “We also went all over the country looking for craftspeople who knew how to use the techniques.” Like Enriquez, costume designer Catherine Rodriguez had a diligent method for visualizing Macondo, including researching Colombia’s national records and referencing watercolors from the period. “I read many books about the author, the period and the fashion of the time,” she said in a translated video call with CNN. “There are many registers; there is much documented about the era.” But the painstaking research only took her and her team so far. “At some point you have to sit down and develop everything. That’s where the creative part comes in. You have to choose colors, applications and textures, because there is no (authority) that says what Macondo looked like in the 19th or 20th century,” she explained. “It’s actually a compilation of many different elements, and the directors wanted it all to look very natural, because the book already has lots of magical elements.” Over the course of the first few episodes, the earth-tone fabrics, practical leather boots and wide-brimmed straw hats worn by Macondo’s early settlers give way to a wider range of silhouettes, from delicate floral gowns to tailored men’s suiting. Visitors continually introduce new styles, such as the traveling gypsies’ colorful textiles, Crespi’s flamboyant embroidered silk from Italy, and the flower-adorned sun hats of the wealthy incoming magistrate’s family. (Speaking about one of Úrsula’s outfits, which has a direct connection to the styles of Civil War-era America, Rodriguez notes that fashion always arrives “a little bit later” due to the town’s isolation.) Though Rodriguez said she doesn’t play favorites when it comes to the characters, she delighted in dressing Rebeca and Amaranta as they grew older — and became secret antagonists over their competing love interests. From the pale, girlish gowns of childhood, their wardrobes become elegant in color and pattern, contrasting with one another. “They grew up in parallel, but actually they have very different personalities,” she said. “They have strong personalities, and so during their lives, their colors do change.” Over the course of the two-season show, Macondo and the Buendía household also continue to transform with time, in both captivating and devastating ways. At first, Enríquez was nervous to take on such an ambitious project, but looking back, she’s “so proud, and really satisfied with all the work we put into it,” she said. “We hope that it’s a way to lead people to the book (for) those who haven’t read it, or maybe reread it,” she added. How many times has Enríquez read the novel? “Ten times,” she said, laughing.",

    "content": "British luxury automaker Jaguar has revealed its Type 00 concept car, the first glimpse of a new electric vehicle following a controversial rebrand that has divided opinion. The manufacturer said it was “introducing an unmistakable, unexpected and dramatic physical manifestation of Jaguar, as the brand continues its transformation,” in a statement published Tuesday after the car was revealed at Miami Art Week. The Type 00 has a long bonnet (a hood in US English) and a fastback profile, as well as 23-inch alloy wheels. It is presented in two colors: Miami Pink and London Blue. “The former reflects the iconic Art Deco surroundings of its reveal, the latter references its British heritage,” said Jaguar in the release. While the Type 00 is a concept and will therefore never enter production, it has divided opinion online. One commenter on X said the car “looks sleek,” but another said that “00 is how many you’ll sell. Beyond ugly.” Jaguar said it will become an electric-only brand focused on luxury vehicles, but the evolution goes further than that. “This transition extends beyond the products Jaguar designs and engineers; it represents a reimagination of the entire brand,” said the automaker. This new brand identity also stoked controversy when it was revealed in November. Under the tagline “copy nothing,” Jaguar published a promotional featuring a diverse cast of models posing and moving through an otherworldly landscape, which drew the ire of traditionalists. “Umm where are the cars in this ad? Is this for fashion?,” wrote one commenter on X. The 102-year-old luxury automaker is replacing its former logo, resplendent in all capital letters, with a new one that is supposed to be a “powerful celebration of modernism,” the company on November 18. Other changes to Jaguar’s branding include a redesigned pouncing cat logo, called the “Leaper,” and a new monogram that incorporates the “J” and “R” in the brand name. that the Leaper, which has adorned its cars for several decades, is being eliminated in favor of the badge. “This is a reimagining that recaptures the essence of Jaguar, returning it to the values that once made it so loved, but making it relevant for a contemporary audience,” said Gerry McGovern, Jaguar Land Rover’s chief creative officer, in a last month. The first production car under Jaguar’s new direction will be a four-door electric grand tourer, which will be built in the UK. It will be revealed in late 2025, said the automaker. Jaguar is also planning to open a number of brand stores around the world, the first of which will open in the 8th arrondissement of Paris.",

    "content": "has named an “evocative soft brown” its color of the year for 2025, continuing a tradition that has now run for more than a quarter of a century. In a statement published Thursday, the global color specialist said Mocha Mousse was “a mellow brown infused with a sensorial and comforting warmth.” “A warming rich brown hue, PANTONE 17-1230 Mocha Mousse nurtures with its suggestion of the delectable quality of cacao, chocolate and coffee, appealing to our desire for comfort,” it added. Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute, said the color evokes “thoughtful indulgence.” “Sophisticated and lush, yet at the same time an unpretentious classic, PANTONE 17-1230 Mocha Mousse extends our perceptions of the browns from being humble and grounded to embrace the aspirational and luxe,” she said in the statement. Laurie Pressman, vice president of the Pantone Color Institute, added that Mocha Mousse feeds into a desire for harmony. “With that in mind, for Pantone Color of the Year 2025, we look to a color that reaches into our desire for comfort and wellness, and the indulgence of simple pleasures that we can gift and share with others,” she said. Each December, Pantone names a color of the year for the following year, and this is the 26th time that it has done so. To make their pick, experts at the Pantone Color Institute trawl through high-fashion runways, interior design trends, pop culture moments and human psychology. The first Color of the Year was Sky Blue in 1999, while more recent choices include Peach Fuzz — “a light, fruity tone that conjures peace and serenity” — in 2024. and Viva Magenta — “an unconventional shade for an unconventional time” — in 2023.",

    "content": "There are only a handful of architects in contemporary history whose names are widely recognized. Think Zaha Hadid, known for her futuristic, sinewy forms that seem to defy structural logic (see, for example, the Heydar Aliyev Center in Baku, Azerbaijan). Or Frank Lloyd Wright, with his long, often low-slung homes of concrete and red tidewater cypress, designed to harmonize with their surroundings (Fallingwater, one of his most famous works, is perched over a creek in a quiet glade outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). Among this cohort is also Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, whose vision of industrial modernism helped define the look of postwar urban America. His signature materials — high-tensile steel, black graphite paint, broad panes of glass — and his minimalist ethos of “less is more” set him apart from the more decorative, hand-hewn buildings of earlier generations. Often referred to simply as “Mies,” the architect and furniture designer was born in Germany in 1886 and relocated to Chicago, Illinois in 1937, where he lived and worked (in part as the head of architecture at what is now the Illinois Institute of Technology) until his death in 1969. So notable was Mies’s fastidious approach and masterful oeuvre throughout the 20th century that, upon his passing, The New York Times described him as a singular “leader of modern architecture” in his obituary. And now, his legacy is expanding. At the 2025 edition of the world’s most prestigious design fair, Salone del Mobile, in Milan, Italy, his iconic “Barcelona” furniture line — a sleek, blocky trio of a chair, daybed and footstool — is receiving its first major update in decades. Added options in the range feature new upholstery choices in twill, velvet and linen, and an ultra-matte black frame (perhaps a subtle nod to the architect’s hallmark painted steel). Previously, Barcelona items have only been available in various leathers, with polished chrome frames. First shown at the German Pavilion at the 1929 International Exposition, the Barcelona chair — the most well known item from the trifecta — wasn’t exactly as it is today: the piece featured only white pigskin and a chrome plated frame that had to be bolted together. Conceived in collaboration with the architect and designer Lilly Reich, it was to function as a ceremonial seat for King Alfonso XIII of Spain at the opening of the expo; its shape reportedly molded after an ancient Roman folding stool. The furniture company Knoll, which later acquired the rights to produce the Barcelona designs in 1948, helped to reengineer the apparatus, forming the swooping “X” shape chassis upon which the squared-off cushions sit. The same cantilevered structure is seen on the footstool, while the daybed, which Knoll calls a “couch,” follows a more traditional four-legged blueprint. The Barcelona range, which has since been in production for nearly eighty years, is made and sold by MillerKnoll (the company was formed following Herman Miller’s 2021 acquisition of Knoll) — and it’s not cheap: base models for the chair start at nearly $8,000. Regardless, it’s a bestseller. On its significance, Amy Auscherman, MillerKnoll’s head of archives and brand heritage, told CNN: “Because the chair in particular has become such a part of visual culture, people are surprised to learn that its original form was developed almost 100 years ago. The line has become emblematic of modernism.” The reluctance to introduce new variations, until recently, stemmed from a desire to stay true to Mies’s tastes and in keeping with the chair’s original hide-based upholstery. But, after recent consultations with professors and authors, the team at Knoll learned that Mies did not oppose the use of other textiles in the collection. If anything, the architect was deterred by the process itself: “The chair is a very difficult object,” he told Time magazine in 1957. “A skyscraper is almost easier.” Auscherman described the Barcelona chair especially as “an almost anonymous design,” given how established the piece has become in contemporary design vernacular. A prized object within homes, but also office and corporate spaces, the chair retains a universality that’s unusual in the often dissimilar worlds of residential and commercial decor. Yet, the architect’s work is anything but incognito. There is a clear aesthetic signature to his work, which is informed by a broad swath of 20th century influences — Germany’s progressive Bauhaus school specializing in modernist art, design and architecture, of which he was the third and final director before its dissolution in 1933, and Western Europe’s International Style movement being among them. It’s clean, it’s linear, but there’s a human throughline — flourishes of imagination, where permitted, and always with restraint. Mies is perhaps most remembered for iconic structures such as New York City’s Seagram Building, a midtown skyscraper completed in 1958 that is still heralded as a beacon of corporate modernism; the Edith Farnsworth House in Plano, Illinois, an ethereal, minimalist residential design made from industrial materials; and the in Detroit, Michigan, which is considered to be among the United States’ most successful post-World War II urban redevelopment projects, with its multiple-unit townhomes and high-rise buildings erected alongside acres of greenery, recreation facilities and schools. Much like his furniture, there’s modernity and usefulness in his projects, each formed with a finite attention (Mies was known to say: “God is in the details”). In his legacy, artistry and utility co-exist — it’s effectively why his footprint remains so pervasive today, said Jonathan Olivares, senior vice president of design at Knoll. “The Barcelona collection offers conceptual, formal and functional clarity,” said Olivares. “These are enduring qualities that transcend trends.” “Mies left us with his most famous maxim ‘less is more,’” added Auscherman. “It’s a philosophy that continues to shape the way people understand modern design.”",

    "title": "\n      K-pop band NewJeans announces hiatus amid ‘mental and emotional toll’ of legal battle\n    ",

    "content": "K-pop band NewJeans played a sold-out show and debuted a new song in Hong Kong on Sunday — just days after a South Korean court prohibiting the group from carrying out independent musical or commercial activities. But the band’s members then shocked an 11,000-strong crowd at the ComplexCon Hong Kong festival by announcing they are now taking a break “out of respect” for the temporary ruling. On Friday, the Seoul Central District Court sided with record company Ador in its long-running legal dispute with NewJeans, saying the band’s attempt to and break away from the label could “seriously damage” the latter’s reputation. Speaking on stage, band member Pham Ngoc Han, who goes by Hanni, said the group’s decision to “pause all activities… wasn’t easy,” but that “we believe this is something we need to do.” Carrying prepared messages on slips of paper, each member addressed their fans (who are affectionately known as “bunnies”) in both Korean and English. Audible disappointment rippled through Hong Kong’s AsiaWorld-Expo, where the band was performing for the first time since attempting to rebrand as NJZ last month. Danielle Marsh, who goes by Danni, said on stage: “As strong as we are trying to stay, it is honestly taking a bit of a mental and emotional toll on us.” The five-piece group has repeatedly claimed its contract with Ador is void amid allegations of mistreatment. The band’s members have accused the label of “manipulation,” “deliberate miscommunications” and workplace harassment. Ador has meanwhile asserted that NewJeans remains under contract, arguing that it cannot carry out entertainment activities without the label’s approval. The record company — which is a subsidiary of Hybe, the entertainment giant behind K-pop acts including BTS — has also disputed allegations of mistreatment, telling CNN via email that most of NewJeans’ claims “have arisen from misunderstandings.” The lawsuit filed by Ador will be heard in full on April 3. In a conciliatory statement, shared with CNN prior to the band’s Hong Kong show, Ador expressed support for the performance — on condition it took place under the name NewJeans, not NJZ. The group appeared to approach the matter delicately, with neither moniker appearing on screens flanking the stage, despite the festival’s other acts being explicitly named. But the name NJZ did briefly appear as part of visuals projected behind the group, while some band members wore tights saying “Chapter NJZ.” A booth on the festival grounds meanwhile sold merchandise with different NJZ logos, including plushie keychains, hats and T-shirts, with some dedicated fans spending hours in line to purchase the items. Danni addressed the issue on stage, saying: “No matter what our name is, no matter what kind of tough time we’ve been through, I feel like to be able to share a moment like this with everyone, is what we live for.” The band also appeared to avoid playing songs from its back catalog, with each member performing solo covers of other artists before coming together to debut a new song, “Pit Stop.” On X, a hashtag referencing the band’s “re-debut” had over 50,000 posts within hours of the show. Fans at the AsiaWorld-Arena meanwhile expressed support for the band — and disappointment with NewJeans’ planned hiatus. “I hope they can keep staying strong, fight this battle well,” said 25-year-old fan Soie So. “We know this is going to be hard to win. To be honest, at that moment (when the band announced a pause on activities) I just felt very touched. I thought they’re very brave.” But despite fans’ backing, Friday’s ruling is a major setback for the group, according to legal experts familiar with the case. Speaking to CNN on Friday, Sangrock Kho, a lawyer at South Korea’s Law Firm Pil, said the court’s decision to uphold the injunction suggests NewJeans’ legal case is “either extremely weak or virtually nonexistent.” “Under the Korean judicial system, in cases like this where an agency files an injunction to suspend an artist’s activities, the proceedings are generally very favorable to the artist,” he said over email. “This is because courts are usually extremely reluctant to issue injunctions that could cause irreparable harm to an artist’s career by restricting their freedom of occupation. “Given that, the fact that the court has nevertheless issued this type of injunction suggests that, after reviewing all the claims, evidence, and extensive presentation materials … the court concluded that NewJeans’ argument — that the breakdown in trust was entirely caused by Hybe and Ador — lacks sufficient legal basis.” NewJeans emerged as one of South Korea’s most successful pop acts after storming to the top of the country’s charts with debut single “Attention” in 2022. The band achieved international success less than a year later with EP “Get Up” (featuring the crossover hit “Super Shy”), which reached number 1 on the US Billboard 200. CNN’s Oscar Holland and Gawon Bae contributed to this story.",

    "content": "A painting of hanging with other presidential portraits at the Colorado state Capitol will be taken down after Trump claimed that his was “purposefully distorted,” according to a letter obtained by The Associated Press. House Democrats said in a statement that the oil painting would be taken down at the request of Republican leaders in the Legislature. Colorado Republicans raised more than $10,000 through a GoFundMe account to commission the oil painting, which was unveiled in 2019. Senate Minority Leader Paul Lundeen, a Republican, said that he requested for Trump’s portrait to be taken down and replaced by one “that depicts his contemporary likeness.” “If the GOP wants to spend time and money on which portrait of Trump hangs in the Capitol, then that’s up to them,” the Democrats said. The portrait was installed alongside other paintings of US presidents. Before the installation, a prankster of Russian President Vladimir Putin near the spot intended for Trump. Initially, people objected to artist Sarah Boardman’s depiction of Trump as “nonconfrontational” and “thoughtful” in the portrait, according to an with Colorado Times Recorder from the time. But in a Sunday night post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he would prefer no picture at all over the one that hangs in the Colorado Capitol. The Republican lauded a nearby portrait of former President Barack Obama — also by Boardman — saying “he looks wonderful.” “Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves, but the one in Colorado, in the state Capitol, put up by the Governor, along with all other Presidents, was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before,” Trump wrote. The portraits are not the purview of the Colorado governor’s office but the Colorado Building Advisory Committee. The ones up to and including President Jimmy Carter were donated as a collection. The others were donated by political parties or, more recently, paid for by outside fundraising. The Legislature’s executive committee, made up of both Democratic and Republican leadership, signed a letter directing the removal of Trump’s portrait. Lundeen, the Republican senator who requested it, noted that Grover Cleveland, whose presidential terms were separated like Trump’s, had a portrait from his second term. Boardman did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. In with The Denver Post, Boardman said it was important that her depictions of both Obama and Trump looked apolitical. “There will always be dissent, so pleasing one group will always inflame another. I consider a neutrally thoughtful, and nonconfrontational, portrait allows everyone to reach their own conclusions in their own time,” Boardman told the Colorado Times Recorder in 2019. Trump’s Sunday night comments had prompted a steady stream of visitors to pose for photos with the painting before the announcement that it would be taken down. Aaron Howe, visiting from Wyoming on Monday, stood in front of Trump’s portrait, looking down at photos of the president on his phone, then back up at the portrait. “Honestly he looks a little chubby,” said Howe of the portrait, but “better than I could do.” “I don’t know anything about the artist,” said Howe, who voted for Trump. “It could be taken one way or the other.” Kaylee Williamson, an 18-year-old Trump supporter from Arkansas, got a photo with the portrait. “I think it looks like him. I guess he’s smoother than all the other ones,” she said. “I think it’s fine.”",

    "content": "Over the past two decades, the Argentinian photographer Irina Werning has traveled around Latin America with a specific directive in mind: find women — and eventually, men — with the longest hair. Titled “Las Pelilargas,” or “The Long-haired Ones,” the body of work celebrates the shared cultural reverence for long tresses across the region, in both small Indigenous communities and urban centers. In her interviews with the people she met and photographed, Werning heard many personal reasons for growing and maintaining ultra-long hair, but connecting stories was often its role in cultural identity and ancestral traditions. “The true reason is invisible and passes from generation to generation,” Werning writes on her website. “It’s the culture of Latin America, where our ancestors believed that cutting hair was cutting life, that hair is the physical manifestation of our thoughts and our souls and our connection to the land.” At the PhotoVogue festival in Milan earlier this month, Werning exhibited the final chapter in the series, called “La Resistencia,” which features portraits of Indigenous Kichwa living in Otavalo, Ecuador. “I was very intrigued by how it would be to photograph men after so many years of photographing women,” she explained on a phone call with CNN — particularly as long hair is often associated with femininity. Werning’s extensive body of work began in the Andes. As she was photographing schools around Argentina’s Indigenous Kolla community in the northwest, during her travels she encountered women with exceptionally long hair, and took their images. “I went back to Buenos Aires, and these pictures were haunting me,” Werning recalled. “So I decided to go back to these small towns.” In the absence of widely used social media platforms in 2006, she put up signs that said she was searching for long-haired women for artistic purposes. As she traveled to more places, she organized long-hair competitions to bring more women together. “Slowly, the project started to grow,” she said. She completed the work in February 2024 with the images in “La Resistencia.” In different parts of the world, braids have become powerful symbols of identity as well as defiance against colonialism and systemic racial injustice. In the Kichwa community, as in other Indigenous groups in North and South America, men and boys wear long braids to reclaim the tradition after a history of forced hair cutting during Spanish colonial rule and pressures to assimilate, Werning said. “Braids in Indigenous communities are a form of resistance, in a way, because conquerors would cut (them),” she said. “The braid was a symbol of identity, of unity. It’s more difficult to take away someone’s language, but this is a very symbolic act that’s very easy to do.” In one image from “La Resistencia,” sisters, dressed in traditional white blouses, gather at a table as their father braids their brother’s hair. Werning said when the father, RUMInawi Cachimuel, was young, his family cut his braids so that he wouldn’t face discrimination at school. But now, he emphasizes the importance of maintaining Kichwa traditions to his children, from their clothing and music to their hair, she explained. “We’ve fought hard for our braids; it was a lengthy struggle to proudly showcase our braids,” Cachimuel told Werning in a translated interview. “As people, we’ve endured significant hardships. Now, I teach my children that they must learn from our ancestors and pass down to future generations what it means to be Kichwa.” In another portrait, a father and his two boys stand in a line, braiding each other’s hair, which only direct relatives are allowed to do, she explained. “Las Pelilargas” will be published as a book later this year. As the series comes to a close, Werning says she’s returned to some places she visited early on, wondering if they had been impacted by any major cultural shifts, like the rise of social media platforms. “As a photographer, we are kind of pessimistic, (thinking) ‘this is something disappearing, so I need to document it,’ and in a way it’s true because globalization really does change communities,” she said. But in the small towns in northern Argentina, where she first began the project, she was happy to find the opposite was true: Las pelilargas were still everywhere.",

    "content": "Just days after OpenAI launched its most advanced AI image generator to date, a social media trend imitating the work of Japanese animation company Studio Ghibli is demonstrating both the technology’s power and the copyright concerns it raises. The latest update to GPT-4o, released Tuesday, features many practical advancements, including more accurate text rendering and the ability to follow more detailed, complex prompts.

Also widely shared, however, is a 2016 in which Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki describes AI-generated art as an “insult to life itself.” Miyazaki is known for his hand-drawn animation and painstaking frame-by-frame method. “I am utterly disgusted,” he says in the video, responding to a video of a monster character generated using text prompts. “If you really want to make creepy stuff, you can go ahead and do it, but I would never wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all.” OpenAI’s updated image generator has also prompted renewed discussions over the role of AI and art. It comes just weeks after nearly 4,000 people calling on Christie’s auction house to cancel a first-of-its-kind sale dedicated solely to AI art over concerns that the programs used to create some generative digital pieces are trained on copyrighted work and exploit human artists. OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman made light of the trend on X, that after “a decade trying to help make superintelligence to cure cancer or whatever” it was Studio Ghibli images that had generated viral interest in his work. “Mostly no one cares for first 7.5 years, then for 2.5 years everyone hates you for everything,” he wrote. “Wake up one day to hundreds of messages: ‘Look I made you into a twink Ghibli style haha’” Altman added, referring to a gay slang term for men who are young, boyish and slim. As is often the case with AI-generated art, the images raise various copyright questions — not only around Studio Ghibli’s work but of the images being reimagined. When CNN prompted ChatGPT to reproduce some of the Ghibli-style memes, the service refused, saying that ” the request didn’t follow our content policy.” CNN’s Jacqui Palumbo contributed to this story.",

    "title": "\n      ‘You only have your eyes to trust’: Miles Aldridge on shooting film in the digital age\n    ",

    "content": "“I like the rigor and tension of looking through the lens and seeing the picture,” said Miles Aldridge. From his studio inside an industrial building in North London, there is an assortment of framed, large-scale works of art — some hung on the walls, others neatly lined up on the floor. The British illustrator-turned-photographer, whose lens has captured numerous stars including Elton John, Donatella Versace and Kate Moss, is recounting his pivot into camerawork and the beauty of shooting with film. The unpredictable nature of film photography has been a powerful motivator for Aldridge across his extensive career, spanning around three decades. “At that point, you only have your eyes to trust,” said Aldridge, of the process when shooting with film. “You don’t know if it was in focus (or) if you’ve got something meaningful until you get the film back and start working on it. And I like that way of working, because the anxiety of not knowing drives you to work harder and be more determined to get (the shot),” he told CNN. It’s an intriguing statement from a photographer known for working only in highly controlled environments. The son of Alan Aldridge, a graphic designer and illustrator who created some of the most enduring pop imagery of the 1960s and ’70s, Aldridge rose to prominence in the mid-’90s when he began working with Franca Sozzani, the longstanding editor-in-chief of Vogue Italia who died in 2016. With painstaking attention given to the lighting, composition and color, Aldridge’s immaculately crafted images often feature glamorous women in moody, suspenseful settings that add an air of intrigue. A culmination of those works is now going on show in London. At Sotheby’s Story Café, the walls and accompanying props and furnishings will be covered, from floor to ceiling, with Aldridge’s kaleidoscopic imagery of women in the kitchen, including one carving ham. A retrospective exhibition, co-hosted by Sotheby’s and the Lyndsey Ingram gallery, will also run until April 17, featuring some of Aldridge’s most iconic shoots, such as “Chromo Thriller #3”, which depicts a woman with coiffed blonde curls, wearing a strappy lace night dress tucked into her underwear. Her arm is held up, a coral-colored hairdryer in hand, next to her head. “This one really emphasizes the cinematic aspects of my work,” said Aldridge. “She’s in a dark, sort of spooky bathroom. I designed the colors (to resemble) one of Francis Bacon’s paintings.” The initial idea, Aldridge explained, was for the model to blow dry her hair in a sexy way. “I checked to see if the colors were pleasing and satisfying,” he said. “We started the shoot, but I wasn’t quite sure what it was about. After a while I decided to review all the Polaroids (used to test shots) and I saw this one (with her) just standing there, sort of static. I realized it felt like she was holding a gun to her head. There was a quietness in her body language compared to the other (images), which were more expressive and loose. And so, the picture feels special in the way that it revealed itself to me through the process. There’s a lot of that in my work.” Rather than take a documentarian approach to photography, which tends to be more reactive and spontaneous, Aldridge’s process can be compared to that of a film director — starting with a storyboard, then the casting and set design. A single shoot can require several months of preparation. The advent of digital photography has made capturing and sharing moments easier and more accessible. But “when you work on digital, you have that instant satisfaction, and I think it actually relaxes the creative muscle,” Aldridge reasoned, adding that working with film allows for a more serendipitous result. “When photography is too organized and prepared, you lose some of the vitality,” he said. Aldridge’s exhibition follows a special edition of Toiletpaper magazine, published in February, which featured several of his surreal images. “When a friend of mine, a stylist, started to work for (artist Maurizio Cattelan and photographer Pierpaolo Ferrari, the founders of Toiletpaper), I said ‘please pass on my compliments’. They came straight back saying they (also) loved my work and often reviewed my images as inspiration,” said Aldridge. “There was a sense of wanting to celebrate this.” When you work on digital, you have that instant satisfaction, and I think it actually relaxes the creative muscle. Miles Aldridge Also on display for the first time are lesser-seen works, such as “Hahaha!”, a chromogenic print of a woman laughing, and a series called “Doors,” featuring a cast of female characters coming in and out of what appears to be the doors of their homes. Their activities might seem banal — carrying a bag of groceries filled with fruits and vegetables, or a fluffy white cat — but the sharp color coordination and gussied up models give the images a psychedelic feel. It’s a mood that has often evaded the work of Aldridge, who throughout our conversation rattles off a long list of creative influences, including the films of Federico Fellini and David Lynch, paintings by Caravaggio, and photography from Richard Avedon and Diane Arbus, as well as the album covers created by his father for the likes of The Beatles and The Who. In an unexpected turn, one-on-one Polaroid portrait sessions are also being offered to the public at Sotheby’s in April, allowing them to experience “15 minutes of fame” with Aldridge. Props including feather boas, oversized glasses and retro telephones will be available on set. Visitors will get to keep “the best” photograph, signed by Aldridge, while he’ll hang onto the outtakes and potentially use them for a future exhibition, depending on the results, he said. It marks another first for the photographer, who rarely turns his lens to someone who isn’t a model or celebrity. (One exception took place prior to the pandemic, when Aldridge took polaroids of private collectors who were visiting his studio.) For Aldridge, the upcoming project brings a sense of excitement and unease. “How will you survive this? How will you achieve it?” he mused. “I’m somebody who likes to control the dynamic of (my) portraits, but in this, I’m relinquishing some control, because the person will want to direct to some degree what is happening.” He continued, “They may not want to look like they are thinking deeply about themselves, which is often an image in my pictures. They might be laughing. They might be wearing horrible clothes that they think are nice, or they may want their hair done in a certain way. There is a wrestle.” “We are always looking for ways to reimagine our spaces,” Sotheby’s global head of photographs Emily Bierman told CNN. “We wanted to push the boundaries within our walls, and who better to do just that than Miles?” She added that the portrait sessions offered “a rare opportunity” for visitors to become part of Aldridge’s artistic process. “His striking hyper-stylized images have never felt more relevant than today — in an age where social media curates a vision of perfection that often conceal deeper, darker truths. It really feels like his work holds a mirror up to this,” said Bierman. And while Aldridge may have little say over his subject matter, the sophisticated pizzazz that comes with his technique is sure to shine through. “Photography is a medium where it’s very hard to do that. Even the world’s worst painter could do better, because painting (allows for) more of a signature. As a photographer, how can you bend the camera to your will, to create your picture?” he said. It’s a challenge that Aldridge has taken in stride. “I dread it, but I think it’s good for you, as a photographer and as an artist, to be taken out of your comfort zone.”",

    "title": "\n      It’s among the largest collections of Michelangelo sculptures ever shown. But there’s a catch\n    ",
    "author": "Jacqui Palumbo",

    "content": "Behind the red-bricked facade and marble friezes of the National Gallery of Denmark, visitors are now able to see nearly all of Michelangelo’s existing sculptures — the “most comprehensive” exhibition of his sculptural work assembled in 150 years according to the institution — and more than 1,000 miles away from where the majority of the Renaissance artist’s works are typically seen. But to do so, the museum did not haul the 17-foot-tall David from the Galleria dell’Accademia in Florence, or the unfinished figure called “The Genius of Victory” that sits nearby in the Palazzo Vecchio. Instead, “ ,” hosted at the SMK (short for Statens Museum for Kunst), relies on some 40 reproductions, including a new set of 3D-printed copies made for the show by the Madrid-based studio Factum Arte. Included is a 19th-century bronze version of “David,” plaster casts of the four famed allegorical figures seen on the tombs of the Medici Chapel, and 3D-printed and cast sculptures of Pope Julius II’s   unfinished tomb. Though it’s not the first time a Michelangelo sculpture has been 3D printed — the University of Florence a David replica made of acrylic resin at the 2020 Dubai Expo — this time, the technology has been used to help bring together nearly all of the artist’s sculptural works in one place. The show also features original works by the Italian artist, including 20 drawings and a group of maquettes — preliminary models in wax and clay. “It is a bit of an experiment,” said Matthias Wivel, the show’s curator, in a video call with CNN. “It’s an exhibition that consists largely of reproductions.” Today, he added, “it’s not something you see so often.” Michelangelo Buonarroti, the 15th-to-16th-century sculptor, painter and draftsman who has endured as one of the most famous artists of all time, is recognized for the dynamism and emotional qualities of his classical sculptures. They twist and turn in space, tense their muscles, or hold seemingly precarious poses despite being rendered in solid white Carrara marble. At Factum Arte’s studio, the team didn’t just 3D print each object, but used a mix of new and traditional techniques. The intensive process involved recording each work with photogrammetry and Lidar scanning to make a digital twin. They first printed each work in resin, similar to the “David” replica exhibited in Dubai, but they didn’t stop there. Then, they created silicone molds from the printed forms and cast each in a marble composite to get closer to the artist’s original material, before hand-finishing the final sculpture. “Our goal is to make the (artworks) visually identical under exhibition conditions,” said Factum Arte’s founder Adam Lowe, in a video call with CNN. “You’re able to distinguish a difference if you can touch them or if you can tap them, because the temperature of the marble is not quite the same.” But why exhibit replicas at all? And, if it really is virtually indistinguishable to the untrained eye (albeit a little warmer to the touch), is it Michelangelo enough? Today, we might not assign much value to reproductions, but in the 19th century, plaster cast versions of famous sculptures were the stars of many museums. Institutions like the Art Institute of Chicago with plaster casts, and the Louvre’s , created in 1794, is still active today. Visitors who have traveled to Florence are already likely to have encountered a plaster doppelgänger of Michelangelo’s “David” in its original outdoor location at the Piazza della Signoria, but they have also been erected in London and Moscow, while bronze versions can be found internationally as well. Many were cast soon after the largest Michelangelo exhibition at the time took place in Florence in 1875 to mark the 400th anniversary of his birth, and featured a mix of original sculptures and new plaster duplicates, Wivel said. But reproductions eventually fell out of favor, and eventually into disrepair, locked away in storage or destroyed. In 2004, the Metropolitan Museum of Art donated its once-prized collection to the Institute of Classical Architecture & Art. They had previously been neglected in “leaky” storage, The New York Times in 1987. “It was a way of gathering and making accessible works of art that weren’t accessible to the general public, either because they were far away or because you couldn’t see them together,” Wivel explained. “There’s been this sort of fetishism of authenticity around original objects (beginning) in the 20th century.” In fact, he added, the entire foundation for Western art would have been upended without reproductions, since precious few original sculptures from Ancient Greece still exist today; the vast majority of our knowledge of the period comes from . The SMK’s extensive collection of plaster casts already included 27 out of around 45 existing Michelangelo sculptures, making it an ideal institution to host the show, Wivel noted. They were also able to relocate the bronze cast of “David” from 1896 — normally displayed outside in Copenhagen’s harbor district — indoors, becoming a “centerpiece” of the show. “I thought that was probably going to be impossible, but it happened,” Wivel said of moving the sculpture inside. A show of this magnitude is “something you can only do with replicas,” Wivel said. “You get a richer experience of him as a sculptor by seeing it this way.” To see the breadth of Michelangelo’s sculptures, you’d have to travel across Italy and make additional stops in cities around the world, including Bruges, London, New York and Paris. Most can’t move and some are behind bulletproof glass, such as the “Pietà” at St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, or placed up high in cathedral niches, like four lesser-known saints he carved for a Siena chapel that until now, have never been reproduced. At the SMK, visitors will have unprecedented intimacy with nearly his entire sculptural output — though not quite all, as some institutions did not give permission to make copies, including two of the four unfinished nude prisoners Michelangelo carved for the tomb of Pope Julius II. (Those missing icons are “the great frustration of the show,” Wivel lamented.) But all of the institutions who loaned the works will own the imaging and data that Factum Arte recorded, which — as they demonstrate through the exhibition — can be invaluable for conservation efforts. One of the most work-intensive replicas they made is a reconstruction of Michelangelo’s early sculpture of St. John the Baptist as an infant from 1495–96, which was housed in El Salvador chapel in Úbeda, but smashed during the Spanish Civil War. Conservators took to restore the work, which went back on view in 2015, but Factum Arte sought to improve upon it by scanning, printing, and casting each of the fragments before reassembling it. “We spent two and a half years working on the reconstruction to put the fragments back as they might have been,” Lowe said. Factum Arte’s data provides invaluable information for institutions, Wivel said. “Its accuracy is down to micron level… And that’s very useful in the future (for) conservation treatments. You can refer back and see what it was like at that time, especially if it’s damaged.” The scans they capture are taken around 20 inches away from the works and “capture right down to the tiniest marks in the surface,” Lowe explained — even dirt and dust, which can prove challenging as it reads as extra volume or noise in the digital model. The scans do have their limitations if parts of the sculptures are inaccessible, like the backs of some that are positioned in chapel niches. But the material and surface details mimic marble in a way that plaster can’t, Lowe emphasized, from the marble veining that’s meticulously added to match the original works, to adding dirt and cracks to the sandblasted exteriors to match the texture and condition. In video clips of the studio taken by Factum Arte, monumental pieces of the sculpture sit together as they come to life over months and years. Spending that time with each work can profoundly change one’s impression of them, according to Sol Costales Doulton, the studio’s project manager who oversaw their making. “The way you perceive these objects, it changes totally,” she said in the video call with Lowe. “The Genius of Victory” was one that began to subtly transform the more she spent time with it, she explained. “Everybody saw him as a quite dispassionate, detached, idolized beauty. And then you start looking at him, and he starts gaining depth, and there’s actually something quite mysterious and deep in his eyesight, (like) something is calling him over his shoulder,” she recalled. “So the psychological charge that the sculpture expresses is totally different when you get a chance to be with it and listen to what it’s saying.” Though it was a privileged position to have that length of time, she encourages visitors to take advantage of the proximity of the works together in one show, and really sit with them. “So many times in passing through a gallery or a museum, you’re rushed to see all the masterpieces. Your attention span will be limited to a minute, a minute-and-a-half, and then you’ll move on to the next object,” she said. “So the possibility of being with them for months, they start to unravel many different narratives.”",

    "content": "The painter whose portrait of Donald Trump was removed from the Colorado state Capitol after the US president branded it “ ” says the criticism has put her four-decade art career at risk. In a statement published to her personal website, portraitist Sarah A. Boardman said Trump’s allegation that she “purposefully distorted” his image was “directly and negatively impacting my business… which now is in danger of not recovering.” Boardman’s painting had hung alongside portraits of other US presidents at the state Capitol in Denver for almost six years before Trump voiced his displeasure with the artwork on social media last month. The work was subsequently removed at the request of Republicans, including Colorado Senate Minority Leader Paul Lundeen, who said it should be replaced with one depicting Trump’s “contemporary likeness,” the Associated Press at the time. In a post published on Truth Social, the US president had written: “Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves, but the one in Colorado, in the state Capitol …  was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before.” He unfavorably compared the painting to Boardman’s portrait of former president Barack Obama — which hung beside it in the Capitol’s third-floor rotunda — writing it looked “wonderful,” while “the one on me is truly the worst.” Trump also took a personal swipe at British-born Boardman, saying: “She must have lost her talent as she got older.” But Boardman disputed Trump’s allegations, arguing that she had worked “accurately, without ‘purposeful distortion,’ political bias, or any attempt to caricature the subject, actual or implied.” The artist added she had received “overwhelmingly positive reviews and feedback” about the work since it was unveiled in 2019. The Colorado Springs-based artist accused the president of calling her “intentions, integrity and abilities” into question. Boardman has previously completed portraits of Republican president George W. Bush, a district court judge and dozens of US military personnel. The artist did not detail how her practice has been impacted by the controversy, writing that she “will not be commenting further” on the matter. The portrait was commissioned by Colorado Republicans, after they raised more than $10,000 for the project through a GoFundMe campaign. Boardman had earlier defended the work from criticism of a very different kind — that Trump’s expression, which she described in the as “serious, non-confrontational (and) thoughtful,” did not reflect the president’s temperament. “My choice of references comes from my decision to remain neutral, and let the criticisms stand on their own throughout time,” she in 2019, referring to the photograph on which her painting was based. “The portrait is not designed for just one faction of the population.” In a statement shared with the Associated Press last month, Colorado House Democrats said: “If the GOP wants to spend time and money on which portrait of Trump hangs in the Capitol, then that’s up to them.” The year before Boardman’s portrait was unveiled, a prankster of Russian President Vladimir Putin near the space set aside for Trump at the Colorado state Capitol. It was discovered by a tour guide and quickly removed by Capitol staff.",

    "title": "\n      Global art sales plummeted by 12% in 2024, says industry report\n    ",
    "author": "CNN",
    "publication_date": "2025-04-09T01:58:02.449Z",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: Global sales of art and antiques have fallen for a second consecutive year, declining by 12% in 2024 to an estimated $57.5 billion, according to the latest annual by Art Basel and UBS. “It’s been a very challenging year overall,” Clare McAndrew, the founder of the research firm Arts Economics, who authored the report, told The Art Newspaper. The year marked the third-largest contraction of the global art market in the past 15 years, the report found, eclipsed only by the years of the 2009 recession (-36%), and the 2020 (-22%), and on par with the 12% drop recorded in 2012. Sales fell in almost every region, with China most affected, seeing a decline of 33%. Sales in the US, the world’s largest art market, decreased by 9%, and slid by 10% in both France and Italy, and 15% in South Korea. “Despite Brexit-related challenges,” per the report, the UK contracted by a more moderate 5%, and has retained its position as the second-largest art market. As the report lays out, the dynamics of last year’s contraction broadly mirror those of 2023, when total sales fell by 4% with the highest price points most affected, due to “ongoing geopolitical tensions, economic pressures and shifting buying behavior.” The once-booming contemporary sector was hit hard, with sales at auction dropping by 36% to $1.4 billion, their lowest level since 2018. Amid a return to more tried-and-tested names, McAndrew noted a growing aversion to risk among buyers. “Several dealers spoke of a lack of curiosity among clients,” she said. “They say they used to fight with collectors for works at artists’ studios. Now everyone wants to buy someone they’ve already heard of. The appetite for the unknown isn‘t there anymore.” The report notes that galleries are more heavily relying on their top three best-selling artists due to “more selective buying by collectors.” However, while sale value is down, trading volume grew by 3%, reflecting greater activity at lower-priced segment of works priced under $50,000. Auction houses last year sold 20% less by value but 4% less by volume, according to the report. A similar trend was seen in the gallery sector, and hinted at the emergence of a more balanced and democratic ecosystem: Dealerships with the smallest turnovers, under $250,000, saw the greatest increase in sales, with a 17% boost, while those with a turnover exceeding $10 million experienced a 9% decline. However, these small gains are undermined by plummeting profitability across most of the art and antiques market, as prices for virtually all aspects of the business, from shipping to rent, have increased. Other positives to take away from the report, McAndrew said, are the increased sales of work by women artists in the primary market, up 3% year-on-year. While the art market experienced regular fluctuations, the report also shows that for the past decade, it has struggled to reach its 2014 peak, despite a significant increase in wealth among the collecting class, especially billionaires. Reflecting on the future of the art market, one dealer is quoted in the report as saying: “Existing young collectors are no longer buying paintings. With the bursting of the contemporary art bubble, there is a high reliance on older collectors who prefer Modern and Post-War art… (but) many of these collectors are in their 60s and 70s, so I am worried about what the art scene will look like 10 years from now. “On the other hand, we know there is a high proportion of wealthy people who have no experience in purchasing art, and the challenge for dealers is how to reach them, rather than focusing on existing art collectors.” .",

    "title": "\n      Inside Ghanaian painter Amoako Boafo’s rise to art-world stardom\n    ",
    "author": "CNN",
    "publication_date": "2025-04-10T09:56:09.116Z",

    "content": "Amoako Boafo is in a buoyant mood. The 40-year-old Ghanaian painter is about to open his first London show, “I Do Not Come to You by Chance,” at a UK outpost of the American mega-gallery, Gagosian. It’s an exhibition showcasing a new body of figurative paintings –– joyful, empowering portrayals of Black men and women, wrought in his distinctive lionized style and pairing fingertip-painting with paper-transferred patterns and blocks of color. In one, a woman stands, hands on hips, draped in white lace; another depicts Boafo himself, on a bicycle, clad in gold chains and chintz. Eshewing a conventional “white-cube” gallery setting, sections of the space are covered in patterned wallpaper. More strikingly, one room is filled with a life-size recreation of the courtyard at Boafo’s childhood home in Ghana’s capital, Accra. “The idea of bringing the courtyard situation to London is me bringing home with me,” said Boafo over Zoom. “The courtyard is a space where I got to learn about almost everything: how to take a bath, how to take care of yourself,; how to sit quietly and listen, how to be disciplined.” Boafo’s rise to art-world stardom has been swift and significant. In 2018, as he was finishing a Master of Fine Arts degree at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna in Austria, American artist Kehinde Wiley found his art on Instagram. “He suggested my work to his galleries,” said Boafo, “which was when things started picking up.” By December 2021, one of his paintings, “Hands Up,” had sold for over 26 million Hong Kong dollars ($3.4 mililon) at Christie’s, setting an auction record for his work. Along the way, there was a residency at the Rubell Museum in Miami, owned by renowned collectors Don and Mera Rubell. Boafo signed with galleries in Los Angeles (Roberts Projects) and Chicago (Mariane Ibrahim). “Then Dior happened,” he said, referencing his collaboration with the French fashion house on its Spring-/Summer 2021 menswear collection, “and it didn’t slow down.” Three of Boafo’s paintings were even sent into space –– on exterior panels of a Blue Origin rocket. “I realized that maybe (my career is) never going to slow down –– and it never did.” Boafo was born in Accra in 1984; his father died when he was young and he was raised by his mother, who worked as home help, cooking and cleaning for different families. He developed a childhood love of art. “It was one of the ways that kids in the community got together: to draw,” he recalled. “I had always wanted to go to art school but, because of financial difficulties, I did not manage to.” Instead, Boafo ended up on the tennis court and played semi-professionally for several years, until a man Boafo’s mother worked for offered to pay his first tuition fees for Ghanatta College of Art and Design in Accra. The four-year course taught him to draw and to paint. But he also took lessons from the tennis court: “not to sit idle; whatever happens, you move,” said Boafo. He moved to Vienna, went back to school and developed the painterly “language” that has since made global waves. “He was confronting the ideology that art history has to be within a Eurocentric form,” said French-Somali gallerist Mariane Ibrahim, who supports emerging artists of African descent across galleries in Chicago, Mexico and Paris. “To purposely deconstruct traditional portraiture and figuration was really an act of rebellion, but also an act of making and creating your own history. I felt a connection in our experiences: being away from home in a place that doesn’t have much of an African- diaspora community.” Today Boafo sits front and center of an art-world reappreciation of Black figuration. “He’s the head of a locomotive of a new generation of painters from West Africa and beyond,” said Ibrahim. The subjects of his paintings are his friends and family, and, frequently, himself, because, Boafo said, “I don’t see why I should not be present when I am representing my people.” The paintings are a visual representation of Boafo’s desire to slow down and take stock. He hopes to work on one more exhibition with a similar theme in a different location –– “and then I will step away from making paintings for shows,” he said, continuing to explain that “I want to take a bit of break because I have other projects that I am passionate about –– like architecture and tennis. I want to build my own tennis academy, to develop (sports initiatives) so that the youth have something to do.” At Gagosian in London, the new self-portraits –– including one of his largest paintings to date, in which Boafo reclines on a bed, swathed in floral patterns and surrounded by plants –– have an added poignancy. They act as “a reminder of the things that I want to do,” he said. “It’s a reminder to take a break and do yoga. Take a break and go on a bike ride. Take a break and look pretty and beautiful. Take a break and, sometimes, just stay home and relax.” With his work now held in major museum collections, from London’s Tate and the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris to New York’s Guggenheim and the Hirshhorn in Washington, D.C., Boafo has become something of a local celebrity in Accra. “Sometimes you wake up in the morning and you have 10, 15 people at your door waiting to talk to you,” he said. “Everybody wants to put their problems in front of you. There’s some joy (in it) and there’s some stress.” He is enmeshed in the local community through his dot.ateliers initiative — an artists’ residency, launched in 2022, that has since expanded to host writers and curators. Crucially, it offers spaces that foster experimentation and allow participants “to evolve or think on (their) own”, he said, adding: “I imagine dot.ateliers to be an institution which should live beyond me.” Working alongside other creatives is key to Boafo’s practice. He frequently collaborates with Glenn DeRoche, the architect behind the courtyard constructed in London, a sculptural installation that also houses some of Boafo’s paintings. “It was the perfect opportunity to pair what we both enjoy: working within communities, but also storytelling through what we create,” said DeRoché, sitting in the middle of the reimagined Accra courtyard, which has been reinterpreted and abstracted in a charred black timber structure. “I thought it was a beautiful way to start the show, with the seed of Amoako’s creativity, his ancestral birth home, but also to tell a story about community.” Boafo may soon be shifting his creative focus, but the act of painting is a constant. “I’m always going to paint,” he said. “It makes me feel good. I will not be making paintings for gallery exhibitions. I’m just going to be painting for myself, to keep reminding myself of where I am and where I want to be –– you know, taking care of me.”",

    "content": "Nigeria is going to Cannes. In what is understood to be a first in the film festival’s near-80 year history, a movie from Africa’s most populous nation has been chosen as part of the Cannes Film Festival’s Official Selection. “My Father’s Shadow,” directed by Akinola Davies Jr. and co-written with his brother, writer Wale Davies, stars Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù (“Slow Horses,” “Gangs of London”). The film is set in Lagos in the aftermath of the 1993 presidential election and follows Dìrísù’s father and two sons Remi and Akin, as they attempt an odyssey across the city amid the election’s turbulent fallout. Davies Jr.’s semi-autobiographical debut feature, produced by Element Pictures in association with Fatherland Productions and Crybaby, already has strong support in the form of distributor MUBI, which snatched up the rights to the film in North America and other territories long before the news of its Cannes debut was announced – lending additional hype to an already buzzy title. The movie will screen in the Un Certain Regard strand – a competition for debut and ascendant filmmakers. . Reacting to the announcement, Davies Jr.’ told CNN in a statement, “This is a testament to everyone dedicated to telling authentic Nigerian stories: from crews, to the countless technicians who power our film industry. “It honors all those – past, present, and future – who laid the foundation for Nigerian cinema. I’m excited to be an ambassador for arthouse film in Nigeria, and even more excited for our cast and crew, whose talent and hard work truly deserve this spotlight.” “My Father’s Shadow” is produced by Rachel Dargavel for Element Pictures and Funmbi Ogunbanwo for Fatherland Productions. Fatherland’s CEO Ogunbanwo told CNN, “It’s an incredible feeling to see our fully Nigerian story – rooted in Wale and Akin’s experience of losing their father at a young age – come to life on a world stage. “We wove in Yoruba, Pidgin, familiar street names from Lagos and Ibadan, capturing the essence of our home. I feel both excitement and a weight of responsibility, representing independent Nigerian filmmakers who create against the odds. We hope people who watch this film will discover who we are as a people, understand where we come from, and see that this is only the start of how far our stories can go.” The Cannes Film Festival announced it had screened 2,909 feature films to curate its 2025 lineup. Of those selected, “My Father’s Shadow” won’t be the sole representative from Africa this year. Also in Un Certain Regard is “ ” by Egyptian filmmaker Morad Mostafa, about a Somali woman working in Cairo, and “Promised Sky” by French Tunisian Erige Sehiri. Meanwhile, Swedish director Tarik Saleh, who has Egyptian heritage, is in competition for the Palme d’Or with “ ” telling the story of an adored Egyptian actor who falls into disgrace. The US-set “The History of Sound,” starring Paul Mescal and Josh O’Connor, is directed by South African Oliver Hermanus. African cinema, particularly from Francophone nations, has a long history at Cannes, the world’s most prestigious film festival. Directing giants including the late Djibril Diop Mambéty of Senegal, the late Souleymane Cissé of Mali and Chadian Mahamat-Saleh Haroun all made the festival a home from home. Recently, a new guard of young filmmakers has emerged – notably, with more women – including Welsh Zambian , French Senegalese (niece of Djibril), Senegalese director and Tunisian Kaouther Ben Hania. But despite having the continent’s largest and most prolific filmmaking industry, Nigeria has had little representation at the festival. Nigerian productions have appeared in festival sidebars like the International Critics Week (where “ ” by Newton I. Aduaka screened in 2007). ﻿But a search of the festival’s online archives shows no evidence a Nigerian movie has ever been a part of Cannes’ Official Selection – comprising the competition for the Palme d’Or, Un Certain Regard, Cannes Premieres, Special Screenings, Midnight Screenings and Cannes Classics. Thierry Frémaux, general delegate of the festival, said at the press conference announcing the 2025 lineup on April 10 that the festival would be checking to confirm if indeed “My Father’s Shadow” marks a historic first Nigerian feature. Nigeria will have a big presence at Cannes this year. At the festival’s international village, Nigeria is back with its own national pavilion. There, the Ministry of Arts, Culture, Tourism and the Creative Economy will launch as part of the “Destination 2030; Nigeria Everywhere” campaign – . The goal is to showcase the nation’s talent and promote international collaboration and attract foreign investment. With the likes of “My Father’s Shadow” and other recent festival titles like “ ,” the first Nigerian film to premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in 2023, there are signs that Nigeria’s film industry is diversifying. The 78th Cannes Film Festival runs from May 13-24. The premiere date for “My Father’s Shadow,” and its theatrical release date, are yet to be announced.",

    "content": "In 1964, 23-year-old Ramon Martinez Martinez left his job as a struggling painter in Madrid, , and journeyed south to Benidorm in search of new opportunities. In the first half of the 20th century, Benidorm was a small seaside town best known for its tuna fish and orange groves, but by the time Martinez arrived, a budding tourism scene was about to take off, providing him and his family with a ticket to a better life. Martinez bet on a boom, but even he could not have predicted what the formerly quiet fishing town would become. Today, Benidorm is known as the “New York of the Mediterranean,” a tourist metropolis distinctive for its high density of skyscrapers. Gone are the fruit farmers and the fishermen, replaced by millions of visitors from across Spain and Europe. In 2023, visited Benidorm — 36 times the size of its . As notorious as it is popular, Benidorm is seen as both an incredible economic success and a symbol of the uncontrolled juggernaut that is Spain’s tourism industry. It’s also the subject of a new book, “Benidorm ” by British photographer Rob Ball. Speaking to CNN over Zoom, Ball explained that he travelled to the Spanish coast “with an open mind,” aiming to depict its “totally unique” landscape and architecture. Having photographed coastal landscapes for 15 years, Ball sees his latest work as “a prequel” to those images — a way of understanding the decline of local tourism as international travel became more affordable to the general public in the 1960s. Close to to Benidorm are from the United Kingdom. So ubiquitous is the British tourist in Benidorm that the town has become known for its abundance of British pubs, availability of full English breakfasts, and broadcasting of British sports on outdoor screens. Every March, thousands of Brits flock to Benidorm to watch the Cheltenham Festival — a popular horse racing event that takes place in England — on TV. Consequently, Benidorm divides opinion in the UK, as it does in Spain. For some, it is the perfect holiday destination — hot weather, familiar faces and bars open until the early hours. For others, the town provides the most inauthentic travel experience possible, Benidorm a byword for debauchery and sleaze. Ball chose to focus on the positive aspects of this controversial town — its natural beauty and groups of happy tourists relaxing on the sand. Benidorm is known by many in the UK as “Blackpool with sun,” referring to a British seaside town popular with domestic tourists, although regarded by some as past its heyday. Depending on who uses it, the moniker can be either complimentary or disparaging. “I’ve always felt that it’s very easy to demonize the working class for going on holiday and getting (drunk),” said Ball, “but I think actually when you work hard for 50 weeks of the year and you want to go and get (drunk) for two weeks in the summer, then you should be able to.” But all this was still to come when Martinez moved from the Spanish capital of Madrid to the humble coastal town of Benidorm. “Everyone came, as my mother and father did, looking for new opportunities,” said Jaime Martinez Gallinar, Martinez’s son and CEO of the Hoteles Benidorm Group of three four-star hotels, recounting his parents’ story from an office high in the Benidorm sky. “It was pretty much the story of the pioneers of the American West,” he added. Martinez first found employment painting the hotels that had begun popping up along Benidorm’s coastline. The owners of the new buildings often didn’t have the cash to pay him, so would offer him shares in their businesses, or a couple of apartments in their buildings. As Martinez’s portfolio grew, so did the ambition of the city’s new mayor, Pedro Zaragoza. Zaragoza, who was a personal friend of Martinez, is a legendary figure in the history of Benidorm. The city as it stands today is built according to Zaragoza’s vision — all high-rises, wide boulevards and pristine swimming pools, as out of place on the Spanish coast in the ‘60s as orange groves and fishing nets would have been in downtown Manhattan. “He was a lover of the area, the natural environment and the tourist industry,” said Gallinar, recalling his father’s relationship with the former mayor. “He is like a god for every hotelier here.” Zaragoza, appointed to his position in 1950, saw the untapped economic potential of Benidorm when others did not. He toured Europe promoting his town’s desirable sun and sea, and made the radical decision in 1959 to legalize the wearing of bikinis on his beaches. Faced with excommunication by the Catholic Church, Zaragoza rode his Vespa nine hours to Madrid for an audience with Spanish general Francisco Franco. He returned to Benidorm with the dictator’s full support. Zaragoza’s persistence, and Martinez’s gamble to uproot his family, were massively rewarded in the years that followed. After a major expansion of “package” vacations in the 1960s — all-inclusive trips abroad that made foreign travel, largely within Europe, available to more people — international tourists began to flock to Benidorm in the hundreds of thousands. Other than a blip during the pandemic, which prompted global travel restrictions, tourist numbers have continued to grow, creating new opportunities in Benidorm, its skyscrapers pushing further and further towards the clouds. The early days of Benidorm’s architectural development were characterised by, as Ball described, a “total free-for-all approach.” Sandwiched between the mountains and the sea, the only way to house the growing number of tourists was to build upwards. The 21st century brought the two tallest buildings in Spain outside of Madrid: the Gran Hotel Bali, built in 2002, and the Residencial Intempo, completed in 2021 — both located in Benidorm. One might expect this continuous development — or the notorious rambunctiousness of its tourist center — to be met with resistance from locals. Yet, while protests against mass-tourism (and the growing issue of rising rents and house prices that come with it) have taken place in recent months across Spain, they’ve not been in Benidorm. “We love tourists,” Gallinar explained. “During Covid, it was like a ghost town, it was so sad. We discovered how much we depend on the people who come here. It’s not like Barcelona; here, everyone is welcome.” Gallinar is proud of the Benidorm pubs that open until 3 a.m. and seeing the melting pot of Spaniards, Brits, and others from around the world, happily drinking and enjoying the atmosphere of a town unlike any other. “People think Benidorm is for old people, for British people, for hooligans,” he said. “There is a stereotype that Benidorm is a cheap place. (But) there is a Benidorm that nobody talks about.” However, Gallinar is aware that tourism in Benidorm is threatening to become too big for the landscape, acknowledging that “the challenge now is how to grow with the natural environment. The land is almost used up. Benidorm is almost full all year round. If we keep growing, maybe we will find that we begin to destroy the environment.” It’s a concern that will eventually need to be addressed, given that demand for the Benidorm experience shows no sign of waning. If the pristine sea, radiant sunshine and pubs full of British revelers in Ball’s photographs are anything to go by, Benidorm is set to remain a holiday destination that people either love, or love to hate.",

    "content": "In March, Russian president Vladimir Putin gifted Donald Trump a mystery portrait of the US president. The painting was delivered by Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, who, in an interview with podcast host Tucker Carlson, described it as “a beautiful portrait” by a “leading Russian artist.” Trump, he added, was “clearly touched by it.” But the portrait itself was not publicly revealed. Now, the artist behind the Kremlin-commissioned artwork has given CNN an exclusive look at the portrait. The painting gifted to the US president shows Trump raising his fist on stage after the failed assassination attempt at his Butler, Pennsylvania rally in July 2024 and is the work of Nikas Safronov, one of Russia’s most famous artists, the Kremlin confirmed to CNN. “It was important to me to show the blood, the scar and his bravery during the attempt on his life. He didn’t break down or become afraid, but raised his arm to show he is one with America and will bring back what it deserves,” the artist told CNN in Moscow. Safronov is no stranger to portraits of world leaders, having painted dozens of global figures including the late Pope Francis, India’s President Narendra Modi and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. For his Trump portrait, Safronov said, he was “visited by some people who said they want me to paint Trump as I see him.”  He did not initially know who his “visitors” were, he added, explaining that as a prominent artist, “there are clients who do not go into details”  – but he suspected it was the Kremlin. “When I started the portrait, I realized this could bring our countries closer, and decided not to charge any money because I suspected what this painting was for,” the artist said. Later though, he says, he was contacted by Putin himself, who told him the flattering Trump portrait was an important step in improving Russia’s relationship with the United States. The Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The portrait which was gifted to Trump by Putin is similar to a painting that , after an official portrait of former President Barack Obama was moved from the location. The dramatic image of Trump raising his right fist, with blood splattered across his face, became an emblem of strength in his presidential campaign.",

    "content": "A set of the first four editions of William Shakespeare’s collected works is expected to sell for up to £4.5 million ($6 million) at auction next month. Sotheby’s auction house announced the sale on Wednesday, Shakespeare’s 461st birthday. It said the May 23 sale will be the first time since 1989 that a set of the First, Second, Third and Fourth Folios has been offered at auction as a single lot. The auction house estimated the sale price at between £3.5 million and £4.5 million. After Shakespeare’s death in 1616, his plays were collected into a single volume by his friends John Heminges and Henry Condell, actors and shareholders in the playwright’s troupe, the King’s Men. The First Folio — fully titled “Mr. William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories & Tragedies” — contained 36 plays, of which half were published there for the first time. Without the book, scholars say, plays including “Macbeth,” “The Tempest” and “Twelfth Night” might have been lost. Sotheby’s called the volume “without question the most significant publication in the history of English literature.” About 750 copies were printed in 1623, of which about 230 are known to survive. All but a few are in museums, universities or libraries. One of the few First Folios in private hands at an auction in 2020. The First Folio proved successful enough that an updated edition, the Second Folio, was published in 1632, a third in 1663 and a fourth in 1685. Although the First Folio is regarded as the most valuable, the third is the rarest, with 182 copies known to survive. It is believed the third book’s rarity is because some of the stock was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. The Third Folio included seven additional plays, but only one — “Pericles, Prince of Tyre” — is believed to be by Shakespeare.",

But that is exactly where officials at a Dutch town hall think one of his silkscreen may have landed, after it was accidentally disposed of with the “bulky waste.” The 1980s print depicting the Netherlands’ then-Queen Beatrix in Warhol’s famous pop art style disappeared when the art collection was being reorganized, according to a statement issued by Maashorst municipality on Thursday after it commissioned an independent agency to investigate. The local authority said it doesn’t expect to find the artworks. As well as the Warhol print, 45 other works were lost in the same way, CNN affiliate NOS reported. They were all stored in the town hall’s basement while the building was being renovated, but they were left unprotected, moved to different places and suffered water damage after a leak in 2023, NOS reported. It is unclear precisely how the lapse happened, and which officials were responsible for throwing out the works, which were valued at around 22,000 euros ($25,000) in total, NOS added. The local authority discovered that the artworks were missing in November and reported their disappearance to the police, but it did not act quickly enough, the report investigating the incident concluded, according to NOS. This is not the first time that an artwork has been accidentally thrown away. In October, an elevator technician working at a museum elsewhere in the Netherlands . However, the cans were later recovered from a trash bag, both still intact. They were cleaned and then displayed on a traditional plinth at the museum entrance.",

    "content": "Winning the trust of convicted burglar Jerry Christy was the kind of challenge undercover FBI investigator had spent years preparing for. A founding member of the bureau’s specialist Art Crime Team, the Oregon-based agent was well-versed in art history — and trained to pose as a would-be buyer, authenticator or dealer of stolen works. Christy, meanwhile, was being covertly investigated in 2007 over the theft of several artworks, including a 17th-century etching by Dutch master Rembrandt van Rijn. “That etching that was my entrée into his ring,” recalled Walker, who recently retired from the FBI after almost 29 years, allowing him to speak more openly about his career exposing fraudsters, forgers and traffickers in elaborate sting operations. “At the time, I was really hyper-focused on learning about fine art prints,” added the former agent, who met Christy through a confidential source in 2007. “And I made him believe I was the kind of person who could sell a Rembrandt.” But things got trickier for Walker, he said, when Christy’s expert accomplice got in touch. “(Christy) took art off walls, but he wouldn’t necessarily know if it was valuable or not. He would figure that out later on,” Walker told CNN over Zoom. “So, starting off that operation, I was the expert — I knew more than him. But, pretty quickly, the tables turned… the stakes got pretty intense once I found myself going head-to-head with an art dealer.” Around 18 months earlier, Walker said, Christy had unexpectedly vanished from the FBI’s radar. It transpired he was serving time, for an unrelated theft, at Washington State Corrections Center, court records show. By happenstance, Christy had shared a cell with Kurt Lidtke, a disgraced art dealer whom the FBI said was imprisoned for selling his clients’ works without paying them proceeds. Using the latter’s knowledge of the Seattle art market — namely the whereabouts of some of its most valuable paintings — the two cellmates began plotting an ambitious crime spree, Walker said. “They were going to hit dozens of collections in the Pacific Northwest to the tune of several hundred million dollars,” he added. Walker, still masquerading as an art dealer, resumed contact with Christy upon his release from prison. Christy soon carried out a successful burglary, while Lidtke was still in prison, according to court documents. And it wasn’t long before his new co-conspirator called Walker to sell him some paintings — and to sound him out, the former investigator said. Every single undercover meeting has the potential to escalate Ronnie Walker, former FBI agent “Fortunately, (Lidtke) thought I was a dealer who specialized primarily in California Impressionists, and he was a dealer who specialized in the Northwest School (a 20th-century art movement),” said Walker, adding that they later “spent a lot of time talking about our respective areas of expertise.” Walker used his art market knowledge to build rapport with the dealer, he said, and gained the duo’s trust by pretending to sell three of their stolen artworks. He also began gathering information about their next potential victim as the FBI prepared a trap at the target’s home. Even as authorities appeared to be closing in — Christy was confronted by police while surveilling the property from a parked pickup truck, though he was allowed to leave the scene — Walker believes his performance had been so convincing that Lidtke was oblivious to his involvement until the very end, attributing Christy’s brief encounter with police on bad luck. “Kurt (Lidtke) didn’t trust his instincts and blame me,” he recalled. “We’d had a long enough, and a solid enough, relationship up to that point that he didn’t listen to that inner voice saying, ‘Well, if only three people in the world knew (about the planned robbery) it must have been (him)’.” The FBI averted the burglary and later arrested the pair, according to court documents. Walker said that incriminating recordings he collected during the sting operation helped secure convictions for both Lidtke and Christy, on charges of conspiracy and transportation of stolen goods. In 2011, they were sentenced to four and five-and-a quarter years in prison, respectively. The Art Crime Team, and Walker’s involvement with it, dates to the early years of the Iraq War. As US troops advanced on Baghdad following the 2003 invasion, looters had plundered an estimated from the country’s National Museum in just 36 hours. At the time, Walker, who had been an FBI agent since 1996, expressed willingness to investigate the thefts. Despite studying business administration and accounting at college, he gravitated toward art history courses and was interested in cases involving cultural heritage. “I called (FBI) headquarters and said, ‘Hey, if you send a team to Iraq, put me in coach,” he recalled. Ultimately, the FBI did not send him, or any agents, to Baghdad in 2003. But amid widespread criticism of America’s failure to protect Iraq’s cultural property — and realizing a need for experts to track down the items, or to be deployed overseas in future looting incidents — the bureau established a specialist art team the following year. Thanks to his earlier interest and internal reputation for sophisticated undercover operations, Walker was recruited to the unit. He was one of fewer than 10 founding agents who would be trained in the history, vocabulary and, most importantly, business of art. “Within the first year of being on the team, I started taking more advanced level college courses that helped inform my approach to these operations,” Walker recalled. The team was focused not only on thefts, from homes, galleries or archeological sites, but also forgery and trafficking rings. Given how many stolen artworks end up on the US market, it also investigated art crimes committed overseas. Today, the unit has more than doubled in size and employs experts in fields including archaeology and anthropology, as well as former art market professionals. Since its founding in 2004, the Art Crime Team has recovered more than 20,000 items of cultural property, including thousands of items from the National Museum of Iraq (though the FBI estimates that between 7,000 and 10,000 of those remain unaccounted for). This two-decade haul is valued at over $1 billion, which Walker called “an oversized return on investment” for the FBI. And that figure doesn’t include the potential value of seized fakes that could have generated billions of dollars if successfully sold. One of the former agent’s last cases involved a dealer with “about $2 billion in inventory — that was all fake,” he said. Recent successes speak to the unit’s broad remit. Last year alone, its investigations led to the return of a to a Philadelphia museum; the recovery of a pocket watch once owned by Theodore Roosevelt that had been missing since the 1980s; and the repatriation, to Japan, of looted following the Battle of Okinawa in 1945. One of the team’s most high-profile cases involved a pair of , worn by Judy Garland as Dorothy in “The Wizard of Oz,” that were recovered 13 years after being stolen from a museum in Minnesota. For the latter operation, Walker posed as a Hollywood memorabilia authenticator to help lure in a suspect seeking the $1 million reward for the objects’ return, he said. To prepare, he spent time with experts at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History (which owns another pair of Garland’s set-worn ruby slippers), to study exactly how they would examine the objects. Twenty years ago, largely, fraud was more of the household names and the dead guys. It was the Rothkos or the Picassos. But now it’s living contemporary artists that are being faked in their lifetime Ronnie Walker, former FBI agent But while there are undercover agents who can be “anything, at any time, in any place,” Walker said, he is not of that mold, despite sometimes running up to five covert operations at a time. For him, it’s all about a level of preparation — sometimes over-preparation — akin to method acting. “It was understanding what that role should look like, and doing my best to understand that persona,” he said. “But at the end of the day, when you’re in role, the best thing to do is just be yourself. It’s easier to lie when you’re telling the truth.” In other words: The more he knew, the more convincing he could be. “I had a lot of cases that involved Warhol, whether thefts or fakes,” Walker offered as an example. “Studying Warhol, and getting a deeper knowledge of his materials, his processes and his compositions helped me in a lot of the undercover operations.” Walker’s performances also relied on “verbal or visual” cues typical of the professionals he was impersonating. He would sometimes dress the part, too, by wearing the expensive clothes of a high-end dealer or dressing down as the kind of uber-wealthy collector who “has so much money he doesn’t need to care about appearances,” the former agent said. He would wear a pair of lucky socks, too. It was, after all, dangerous work. “There were a few moments where I thought to myself, ‘Oh, this is how it ends,’” he recounted in a subsequent email exchange with CNN, adding: “Every single undercover meeting has the potential to escalate, even when dealing with individuals that don’t have a history of violence. In fact, I think those individuals that have no prior convictions can be more dangerous. They tend to have the most to lose.” Cases come to the Art Crime Team in various ways. Local police may alert the FBI to thefts if the stolen goods cross (or are thought to have crossed) state lines. The bureau also invites the public to provide anonymous tip-offs via its , a database containing thousands of missing paintings, sculptures and artifacts with cultural value, from candelabras to ceramics. Usually, however, missing art only comes to the authorities’ attention when it enters, or re-enters, the market. “Stealing the artwork is usually the easy part,” Walker said. “It’s selling the artwork that’s the hard part (because) there aren’t too many people in the world — and certainly no reputable art dealers — who want to buy stolen art. Often, the thieves haven’t really thought through how they’re going to sell the artworks.” The FBI’s running list of “ ” features various high-profile items that would now be near-impossible to move on the open market. There’s the $3 million Stradivarius violin stolen from a New York City apartment in 1995, and the Pierre-Auguste Renoir painting taken in an armed robbery from a Houston home in 2011. Then there is, in Walker’s view, the holy grail of art crime: The 13 works, including paintings by Rembrandt, Édouard Manet and Edgar Degas, snatched from Boston’s Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in a notorious 1990 heist. “If you said you had a lead on them tomorrow, in any part of the world, the team would throw every resource they could at (it),” he said of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum artworks. You might also, he added, end up $10 million richer thanks to the offered up by the museum’s board. Art criminals’ motivations are almost always financial, Walker said. Their downfall often shares a common theme, too, whether it’s trusting an undercover agent or seeking big-money rewards for stolen goods: greed. And while the former agent didn’t see a significant increase in art-related crimes over his two decades investigating them (if there appear to be more media reports, it’s because “we just got better at doing our job”), he believes perpetrators’ scope and abilities grew in that time. “Twenty years ago, largely, fraud was more of the household names and the dead guys. It was the Rothkos or the Picassos. But now it’s living contemporary artists that are being faked in their lifetime,” he said, adding that technology now allows forgers to operate without conventional artistic skills. “There are printing technologies that can mimic brushstrokes. So, with a small investment and a really good high-resolution camera, you can create fakes today that rival the quality of a (master forger).” The threat posed to living artists is now Walker’s main preoccupation. After retiring from the FBI in December, he founded (ALI), a non-profit helping artists protect their work and livelihoods from fraud. Having spent a career solving crimes, he now hopes to prevent them from happening in the first place. Forgeries come in two guises: either a known work is replicated, or a new composition is created in the artist’s style and positioned as a previously undocumented work. According to Walker, the solution — to the latter, at least — is surprisingly simple: cataloging. ALI is creating a detailed digital archive, stored on its server, that he hopes would become the definitive record of an artist’s output. “Documenting what you create, as an artist, is the most important thing you can do… There’s been no shortage of artists who grind away for (decades) to finally get recognized for their contribution, for demand to increase, and then all of a sudden, the fraudsters come out,” he said. “They start attacking the style the artists were doing 20 or 30 years earlier that is not well documented — and it’s those gaps (in provenance) that allow the fraudsters to thrive.” As for identifying like-for-like replicas? That’s where technology now comes in. Last month, Walker’s organization announced a partnership with optical AI firm Alitheon that can create a unique “digital fingerprint” for any artwork — thousands of data points recording miniscule surface details, invisible to even the greatest forger’s eye. “It is simple to use and scalable, and it just works,” Walker said, joking: “Even an old, retired FBI agent can use this tech.”",

    "content": "A huge by Mark Rothko, thought to be worth tens of millions of dollars, has been removed from display in a Dutch after it was damaged by a visiting child. Conservators will now have to repair the artwork, after it was “scratched” by a child visiting the Rotterdam gallery where it was on display. The abstract painting from 1960, which measures 7 feet, 6 inches high by 8 feet, 6 inches wide, was a centerpiece of the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam – though it had been temporarily on display at the Depot Boijmans Van Beuningen as the museum is currently closed for a large-scale renovation. The museum confirmed the incident in a statement emailed to CNN. It said: “The painting Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8 by Mark Rothko has sustained superficial damage after a child touched the painting when it was on display. As a result, small scratches are visible in the unvarnished paint layer in the lower part of the painting. “Conservation expertise has been sought in the Netherlands and abroad. We are currently researching the next steps for the treatment of the painting. We expect that the work will be able to be shown again in the future.” The museum declined to say how much the painting is worth nor how much the damage might cost to repair—or who might be expected to foot the bill. In response to a question about the painting’s value on its website, the museum said the piece was bought in the 1970s for an undisclosed amount. It went on to explain: “An appraiser from an international auction house would be involved in a sale of an artist as famous as Rothko. The price is then very dependent on the condition, size, frame, etc.” Latvian-born American artist Rothko, who died in 1970, was best known for his “color field” paintings. His works regularly fetch millions of dollars at auction – in November 2023 “Untitled, 1968” sold for $23.9 million at in New York. Museums and galleries are usually eager to promote visits from families with young children, in the hope of fostering an early interest in the arts. Many have programs and workshops aimed at young visitors and actively encourage them – but children can, of course, be unpredictable. Maxwell Blowfield, writer and creator of the popular “maxwell museums” newsletter, told CNN: “Every museum and gallery thinks hard about how to balance meaningful physical access to artworks and objects with keeping them safe. I’d say most have the balance right but accidents can still happen. It’s impossible to prevent every potential incident, from visitors of all ages. Thankfully things like this are very rare compared to the millions of visits taking place everyday.”",

    "content": "For much of her life, Vivian Maier was something of a mystery. Her photographic talent went largely unrecognized because she kept her work a secret from most of the people who knew her, including the New York and Chicago families she worked for as a live-in nanny and caregiver. Maier only printed a tiny fraction of the hundreds of thousands of images of bustling city life she snapped with her Rolleiflex and Leica cameras over some five decades, and showed them to almost no one, instead amassing boxes and boxes of negatives and unprocessed film. Her fame came about posthumously, and only because the contents of her Chicago storge lockers were sold off at auction in 2007, after she had stopped paying the rent. “Vivian Maier the mystery, the discovery, and the work — those three parts together are difficult to separate,” said Anne Morin, curator of the touring exhibition “Vivian Maier: Unseen Work,” which opened 31 May at Fotografiska New York, the American outpost of the Swedish contemporary photography museum. The show, which runs through 29 September, does not attempt to unravel the puzzle of Maier’s life, however, instead focusing on the work itself, with more than 200 photographs on display, including about 50 vintage prints made by Maier. Morin places her work on the same level as that of renowned street photographers like Robert Frank and Diane Arbus, and worthy of a place in the history of photography. “Nobody doubts that,” Morin told CNN. “The work is strong and Maier had a marvelous eye. And in 10 years, we could do another completely different show — she has more than enough material to bring to the table.” The exhibition is also a homecoming of sorts for Maier, who was born in New York to a family of French and German immigrants. She started capturing street scenes in the city as a young woman in the 1950s, first borrowing her mother’s Kodak Brownie box camera and then buying her own professional-grade Rollieflex, which she taught herself to use. Her confidence and skill in finding the right moment to snap the shutter is evident even in these early works, in which Maier zeroed in on the unique characters and situations that make up city life: Men snoring open-mouthed on park benches; a balloon from the Central Park Zoo floating to hide a doting father’s face as his baby reaches towards him. But while Maier was known to use commercial studios in New York to have her film processed, she never seems to have made a serious effort to exhibit or sell her work. Maier’s return to New York as a popular icon is “a big thing not only for women, but also for all the artists who are working and are never recognized and never have the opportunity to be seen, to be shared, to exist,” Morin said. “It is never late to repair history.” New York is “in many ways, the heart of photography history in America,” said Sophie Wright, the museum’s director. “So it’s amazing now to be in a position to be bringing Vivian back to that world. She’s a rediscovered, important voice of 20 -century photography.” Wright added that Maier’s photographs were taken with “so much thought and care and lack of self-consciousness — there’s no audience in mind. In a way, it’s pure, artistic expression for her.” Maier’s name and work first captured the public imagination in 2009, the same year she died in Chicago, after the collector and amateur historian John Maloof shared scans of her work on the photo-sharing website Flickr. He was seeking advice on what to do with the thousands of negatives, prints and undeveloped rolls of film he had acquired over the past two years, after stumbling across Maier’s work at the auctions of her storage lockers. Photographers and critics immediately remarked on Maier’s well balanced compositions, and her incisive and often humorous view of the people and places she came across, not just in New York, but also Chicago, where she moved in 1956 and spent most of her adult life, as well as the far flung locations she visited on vacations, from California to Europe and Asia. In 2011, Maloof published a book, “Vivian Maier: Street Photographer,” and with the filmmaker Charlie Siskel co-directed the 2013 documentary “Finding Vivian Maier,” which was nominated for an Academy Award. A number of other gallery shows and biographies have also debuted in the years since— as well as a legal tussle over Maier’s estate, which is by Chicago’s Cook County Probate Court, and with which Maloof has signed an agreement to display and sell her work. (While Maier did not have any children of her own to inherit her estate, 10 potential heirs in Europe have been found among her extended family, and the court is looking into whether her brother Carl, who died in a psychiatric hospital in 1977, might have had any children.) The public’s appetite for Maier hasn’t diminished, however. When the current exhibition was on display at the Musée du Luxembourg in Paris in 2021, amid the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 213,000 people attended over its four-month run. The opening preview in New York on 30 May had over 600 visitors. Despite her immense popularity, some museums have been slow to accept her work, even those that have major photography collections. Wright attributes this caution over Maier’s work to the fact that she did not make many prints herself. “There’s a reticence to be seen to be driving a narrative for the work that’s not the artist’s,” she explained, as well as a nervousness around the politics of her situation as a woman who was vulnerable in her later years. (At the end of her life, as her hoarding led to her losing caretaking jobs, Maier was believed to have been facing homelessness, until two of her former charges, Lane and Matthew Gensburg, paid for an apartment for her to live in, and later a nursing home.) Maloof and the photography dealer Howard Greenberg, who represents his extensive collection, acknowledge the concerns around posthumous printing of Maier’s work, and during a talk at the exhibition opening, said that led to their decision to only create uncropped, direct reproductions from her negatives. In the show, there are many instances where these later prints are displayed next to the ones Maier made herself, showing how she chose to focus on certain elements in a scene. Maier’s presence can also be felt in the exhibition through audio recordings she made  interviewing the children she cared for to encourage their critical thinking, which were also found in her storage lockers. They are played throughout the galleries. But the most persistent reminders of the artist behind these works are the numerous she took, often as reflections in mirrored and glass surfaces, or simply as her shadow cast on the ground or a wall. “The beating heart of the work is the self-representation,” Morin said, and it is these works she sees resonating the most with today’s audiences. “Everybody says, ‘Oh, my God, Vivian was .’ But it’s different,” the curator continued. Maier’s self-portraits are a stubborn insistence in declaring her independence and identity, at a time when women, and especially domestic workers like her, were ignored and marginalized. “She wanted to record that,” Morin said, imagining Maier as saying: “I’m here at this moment. No one will erase my face. I exist and I have the proof.”",

    "title": "\n      In Gregory Crewdson’s photographs, an enduring, haunted vision of American life\n    ",
    "author": "Jacqui Palumbo",
    "publication_date": "2024-06-04T12:55:38.390Z",
    "cate": "style",
    "content": "By now, the famed photographer Gregory Crewdson’s well-oiled, large-scale shoots are well documented. He has shut down areas of small towns and built soundstages of shadowy home interiors to get at what lays beneath the suburban facade, encapsulating a disquieting view of America. His weekslong productions include a full crew (and costs) comparable to small independent films, as well as a casting process to find subjects who have a particular sense of melancholy. But for his earliest bodies of work, made in the late 1980s and early ’90s, Crewdson hacked it the best he could. As a student at Yale’s MFA photography program, he shot what he could find in homes in Connecticut and Western Massachusetts, directing families to act out scenes of creeping unease. He built uncanny table-top sets and tableaus of animals in nature akin to museum dioramas, using forced perspective to make them seem larger-than-life. For his formative images of small-town landscapes, he procured a tree surgeon’s crane to get high above the rooftops, and — dangerously — pirated electricity from homes to light scenes rather than rent generators. “It was such a ragtag team,” Crewdson recalled in a video call with CNN. “It was a bit like the Wild West — we had very few permissions or permits. We were just out there improvising, and it felt so exciting.” Three decades later, Crewdson is reflecting across all his work as a major retrospective opens at the Albertina museum in Vienna, showing all his series together (minus his commercial work) for the first time. Among them, brings together his grand, eight-year endeavor “Beneath the Roses” from the mid-2000s, his earlier low-budget black-and-white images of “Hover” from 1996, and his meditative return to photography after a difficult period of divorce and transition, “ ” in 2013. The show’s curator, Walter Moser, framed the exhibition and around Crewdson’s long dialogue with cinema, including inspirations such as David Lynch, Steven Spielberg and Alfred Hitchcock. “He really is quoting popular culture,” Moser said in a phone call with CNN. “It’s a visual language we all know… so we can connect to that. At the same time, his topics are very in the present.” When Crewdson began his career, he was among a set of postmodernist photographers — including Jeff Wall, Cindy Sherman and Philip-Lorca diCorcia — who were concerned with the artificiality of photography, often blurring truth and fiction. “They analyze how we perceive reality, and how reality is constructed in photography,” Moser said. With Crewdson’s work, he added: “It’s completely staged, and every detail is thought through. But at the same time, it’s also documentary in the sense that he’s really reflecting the state of society.” From the beginning, the now-familiar elements in his work were already present. Consider an image taken in the late ’80s made in Pittsfield, Massachusetts — a city he has continually returned to, including amid its industrial decline for 2018’s “An Eclipse of Moths.” In the cool glow of nighttime, he photographed the view of a lit baseball field outside of a bedroom window, gauzy curtains pushed back. The composition of mysterious lighting, nighttime stillness and window — motifs that he’s often returned to in the years since — clicked something into place, he said, a sense of something “there but not there” that he’s strived for ever sense. (The phrase is also the title of a 2017 directed by his studio manager and romantic partner, Juliane Hiam.) “I remember taking it and knowing that it felt meaningful to me. There was something beautiful to me about looking through a window at something that’s slightly outside of reach,” Crewdson explained. “When I look at the work I made when I was 25 or 26, it’s like — in a very early stage — it’s not that far from what I even did last week,” he added. Desire and disconnection have served as the architectural foundations on which neighborhoods are built in Crewdson’s world, which he described as sitting “partially outside of reality.” His final images are composites of multiple frames, allowing for every area of the image to be sharp, making them appear “hyperreal,” as Moser described. Lost in thought or memory, the characters Crewdson places together rarely interact in these exaggerated environments. Instead, they are often confronted with strangeness cutting through the banality of the day in the form of a blinding spotlight, blazing fire or blood in the sink — a callback to Spielberg’s aliens lurking off-screen in “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” or the found severed ear in Lynch’s “Blue Velvet.” Artists such as Sherman, Edward Hopper and William Eggleston, who played a role in Crewdson’s take on the American psyche, are also all apparent. But by now, the photographer’s highly recognizable and inimitable style has helped shape the country’s image, too. Some of his forays into pop culture were by his own hand, like when he teamed up with HBO’s “Six Feet Under” — another uncanny, iconic study of the American family — to shoot a verdant kitchen scene with the cast for the promotion of the show’s third season. Another, his lone editorial commission, “Dream House,” for the New York Times Magazine in 2002, cast A-List actors Julianne Moore, Tilda Swinton, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Gwyneth Paltrow as nameless residents of a Vermont home, nearly obscuring their celebrity. But his vision permeates elsewhere, too, through direct or presumed nods from other creatives: the eeriness of life in the small town of “Stranger Things,” or the surreal floral-laden bedroom scenes of Taylor Swift’s music video “Lavender Haze” (with the latter parallels spotted by Swifties on ). “That’s the way culture works; it’s like a two-way street,” Crewdson said of unexpected references to his work. “And sometimes it can be a little beguiling, but… you just have let that be part of the equation.” Though Crewdson’s body of work spans societal shifts that have included political polarization, an epidemic of loneliness, suburban anxiety and rural decline, he refrains from making specific commentary — though he contends “it’s in the work.” He also avoids markers of place or time, switching out street signs or storefront text, and favoring non-distinct cars and clothing. Nor is his view of America a particularly wide one, shot primarily in Massachusetts, as well as New York and Connecticut, in the areas where he’s lived, studied and taught his whole life. (Crewdson is now the director of the graduate program he attended at Yale in New Haven, and resides in the Berkshires). Over time, he’s revisited streets or buildings he’s previously photographed and recast some of the same characters, creating subtle narrative connections across his series. “There are photographers who chronicle the American landscape in a vast way — for me, it’s always been going back over and over again to the same towns,” he said. “Part of that’s practical, because once you become a known figure in the town you can shut down streets and work with the fire department for wet downs,” he explained, referring to the method to drench a set for atmospheric or weather effects. “But the bigger part is psychological. I have a connection to this place in terms of an aesthetic response — it feels familiar to me.” Even when Crewdson began his career, he knew his love for cinema would guide his work, though he has always stuck with teasing out the enigmatic narratives of still pictures rather than moving into film. But he didn’t foresee that his productions would eventually become so immense. “It built slowly and organically, until all of the sudden you realize, ‘This is kind of crazy, all these people,’” he said. “But you have to block all that out and think about the picture in the end.” He hasn’t been behind the camera himself since ‘Hover’ in the 1990s; Instead, his longtime director of photography, Rick Sands, has that honor, while Crewdson prefers to have the scene come together in front of his eyes. “This might sound disingenuous, but it’s the only way I really know how to make a picture now,” he said. “It’s how I’ve figured out how to reflect what I see in my head.” In the 2017 documentary short “There But Not There,” he describes the tranquility that occurs as the chaos of production comes together into that “elusive” moment “when the picture actually works,” he said. It’s that moment — not the final picture — that he’s always chasing, he reiterated on the call. It doesn’t always come easily, though; in a recent shoot, it happened, “but barely,” he added with a laugh. Crewdson acknowledges that many of the themes he’s returned to repeatedly, including the sense of being both “present yet absent,” are reflections of himself. His desire for a moment of stillness has wider implications in his own life. “We live our lives in like partial chaos. There are so many things that are destabilizing in life, and I have a lot of anxiety day to day — that’s just a condition of being alive,” he said. “I think part of why we are drawn to art in general is to feel a certain sense of order or meaning. Even though my pictures can feel dystopic or sad, there’s that moment where everything just comes together, and it feels like it makes sense.”",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: The photograph could have been taken at any birthday party: three girls in dresses standing side-by-side in a living room, balloons and streamers strung up around an entryway. The subjects could be friends or sisters, each with long brown hair that falls past their waists. But with their faces turned away from the camera, there’s a reason for their anonymity, and a deeper significance to their unveiled hair. The girls live in Kabul under the increasingly watchful eyes of the Taliban, who returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021 when US troops abruptly withdrew from the country. After initially pledging to honor women’s rights, the Taliban has nearly erased women from public life, sending girls behind closed doors, even to mark occasions such as these. Taken earlier this year by Iranian-Canadian photojournalist Kiana Hayeri, the portrait is just one of many images from a six-month body of work showing the lives of Afghan women as the Taliban has continually , including requiring veiling in public and , as well as prohibiting them from secondary school, much of the workforce and many social spaces. Working with French researcher Mélissa Cornet, the pair’s collaborative report “No Woman’s Land” received funding from the Carmignac Photojournalism Award and is this month as a mix of photographs, videos and collaborative art with Afghan girls. Hayeri and Cornet traveled to seven provinces and met with more than 100 women during the first half of the year for the report. They met in 2018 in Kabul and have both lived in Afghanistan on and off for several years. Hayeri was present during the chaos of the US military’s withdrawal, and Cornet returned soon after. “Week by week, there was a different fear,” Hayeri recalled to CNN, beginning with her immediate safety amid the shock of the country’s fall. “As we saw how everyday things changed and events unfolded, the fear became about what was going to happen to society, and what was going to happen to Afghan women.” The pair wanted to present a nuanced view of Afghan women’s lives, they explained in a video interview. Rather than a one-dimensional view of oppression, “No Woman’s Land” is meant to be a longer, deeper look at the “immaterial losses” of a generation of women who have lost hope in the future, Cornet said. As their work shows, the ramifications have been complex. “Without minimizing how terrible the situation is… there’s a lot of layers,” Cornet explained. “It’s a very heterogeneous country. So if you go to the south, to the north, to the center, to the west, you see completely different realities.” Though Afghan society is “deeply” patriarchal, Cornet added, allowing the Taliban to “outsource control of women” to men in their families, the urban and rural divide can be wide. Many women never experienced the progress in equality made in city centers over the past two decades, they explained. Cornet noted the Taliban’s rule isn’t homogenous either, with some parts of the group turning a blind eye to underground schools that still educate girls past the sixth grade, which they documented as part of the series. The tensions in ideology among the Taliban go all the way to the top, according to a by The New York Times, with the infamous militant and now acting interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani allegedly privately lobbying for young women’s education in opposition to the decisions of the hardline head of state, Sheikh Haibatullah Akhundzada. Over the course of the six months, Hayeri and Cornet repeatedly photographed the teenage girls in the birthday party portrait, as well as their extended circle of friends. They met them in their homes, and at other private gatherings for celebrations like birthdays and weddings. “In this particular case, it was a 16-year-old’s birthday party for one of the girls,” Cornet said. “She’s not in the photo, but she had a big black and gold, super dramatic dress that her mom had made for her.” Though music and dancing in public have been outlawed, the girls at the party played music from their phones on a large speaker and danced together, they said, posing for images posted to their social media accounts. They’ve seen some of the girls continuing to share images of themselves without hair coverings, taking a risk each time they do. In their project, Hayeri and Cornet kept returning to small beauty rituals often taken for granted, like the girls braiding each other’s hair or applying makeup or henna, in a climate where those acts have become highly charged with meaning. “Resistance for Afghan women cannot mean to go on the street and protest, to be outspoken,” Hayeri said. Resistance instead is “existing, because the Taliban is trying to wipe them from public (life) and…strip them from their identities.” Though the pair documented many difficult facets of Afghan society, from mothers struggling to feed their children to families affected by the suicides of girls taken out of school, they also looked for “pockets of joy,” Hayeri said. “It’s important to think about joy as a form of resistance. “It’s something that both Melissa and I have been obsessing over — when there is no hope, there is absolutely no light at the end of the tunnel, how do you go on about your lives?”",

    "content": "Moving from Tehran to the more northerly lakeside city of Rasht aged 13, Khashayar Javanmardi’s youth was punctuated by weekends and extended holidays on the Iranian coastline of the Caspian Sea. “It was a dreamy place,” the photographer reminisced on a phonecall with CNN. “It was my utopia; everything happened for me at the Caspian.” Diluting this picturesque vignette, Javanmardi recalled the nuisance of the accompanying gammarus: an amphipod crustacean similar to a freshwater shrimp that would nibble at his feet whenever he ventured into the water. He had always hated them, but as he grew aware of their absence, alarm bells started to ring. “That was the first thing I noticed change,” he said. “Later I read that, due to pollution, they were extinct. They had been food for bigger species…” Situated between Europe and Asia, the Caspian is the world’s largest inland body of water; a colossal-sized endorheic basin — or a major lake — that is also bounded by five countries, Iran, Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. In recent years it has been the source of much concern for those privy to its shorelines, owing to what the UN Environment Programme has described as “an enormous burden of pollution from oil extraction and refining, offshore oil fields, radioactive wastes from nuclear power plants and huge volumes of untreated sewage and industrial waste introduced mainly by the Volga River (which flows through Russia and into the Caspian Sea).” It was anxieties about the water’s biodiversity that kickstarted Javanmardi’s decade-long photography project, highlighting the environmental and social impact of the area’s man-made deterioration. A new monograph , is the result of this extensive survey and operates simultaneously as a warning and an invitation to learn. “This project is the essence of my life and career,” acknowledged Javanmardi, speaking from Lausanne in Switzerland, where he is based today. “As an artist, I’ve always wanted to be an honest witness.” The book oscillates between landscapes, portraits and the quiet scenes that fit somewhere in the middle. On one page three family members stand facing out to rough white waves, the foot of a presumed fourth poking out of the window of a car to their left; elsewhere a mustached man sits alone at a plastic table, a look of despondence creeping across his face. Pictures of abandoned ships and other discarded objects further foreground the damage, coupled with a sense of loss. Nominated at last year’s Prix Elysée (one of the world’s most prestigious photographic prizes run in conjunction with the Elysée Museum, also in Lausanne), an early iteration of the project received the special jury mention. Subsequently, the museum’s director Nathalie Herschdorfer penned the book’s introduction, describing how throughout its pages “we discover scenes that leave an aftertaste of desolation” and noting that “the inhabitants who pass through these landscapes, often photographed from a distance, express loneliness mixed with a sense of sorrow.” “A question that I asked people was, ‘what is the role of the Caspian in your life?’,” said Javanmardi, who began working on the project at Iran’s Anzali Lagoon. “They were really open, sharing their memories and how they feel. They call it the Mother Caspian and one guy, a shepherd, said ‘it’s like we were not good to our mother, we were not that kind to our mother and now she’s sad and she’s not going to share her love.’” Indeed, while the Caspian was once a major hub for movement between Iran and Europe, in the last century it became a venue for leisure. Today though, Iran’s Environment Department says its waters are contaminated with over 120,000 tons of pollutants annually — domestic and industrial as well as oil remnants — while Javanmardi estimates the fishing rate has slumped by 70%. “If it shrinks, people’s lives shrink,” he explained, citing further statistics that project water levels could drop by between nine and 18 meters by the end of the century. Military activity, namely Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, is a further aggravating cause (the former is suspected of having used its ). Furthermore, the photographer characterized language as at the core of the negligence: though it’s widely talked about as the Caspian “Sea”, the Caspian is technically a lake, a categorization that would imply stricter regulations by the respective governing bodies around waste and pollution (than the sea). “They (politicians) don’t call it a lake, and one of the reasons is that if they change it, the whole conversation around regulation would change,” Javanmardi suggested. His objectives for the project have always been to raise awareness, he continued. “That’s my goal, and so I tried to use the body of water as a way to communicate culture and politics, global politics — because this is not just about Iran,” he said. “I’ve tried to show how the Caspian is still alive. For me, it’s the last cry of life — you always feel something is in the air when you see the photos. I like to give this space to the audience, to feel this.” Despite the recklessness of higher political powers, during his travels Javanmardi found a sense of community in the people he met. “How they pay attention to the environment and are careful and in love with the Caspian, this is something that makes me hopeful,” he shared. “As long as I see this spirituality, that people know how privileged they are to live beside that sea… I know, as a person from there, we won’t let it be ruined.” “Caspian: A Southern Reflection” by Khashayar Javanmardi is published by Loose Joints and out now",

    "content": "Deep within the Arctic Circle, pocketed between giant glaciers and beneath polar ice floes, Swedish photographer and content creator found extraordinary warmth. The Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, lying roughly midway between Norway’s northern coast and the North Pole, is the site of the world’s northernmost permanent settlements. Blomdahl, who lives in Svalbard’s largest city of Longyearbyen, is one of about 2,500 residents in the region. Here, colorful cabins contrast colossal ice cap backdrops and vibrant celestial phenomena light the sky. Blomdahl moved to Svalbard in 2015 and documents her unique life to millions of fascinated social media followers. She has now captured her home’s serenity, sparkling in shades of blue, in a new photobook titled “ .” “When you live here, you really get immersed in it; the quiet and peaceful nature,” Blomdahl, a former hospitality worker turned content creator, told CNN, “And every day being so close to the nature; it’s infatuating.” For all its natural beauty, Svalbard is much more than a pretty place. Its , such as fish, gas, and mineral deposits, have made it a topic of economic and diplomatic dispute in the past, and it now serves as a flourishing global hub for economic activities and scientific research. For those just coming for a spell, it’s a bucket list tourist destination. But as Blomdahl knows, life in Svalbard isn’t easy. From sometimes plummeting to below minus 30 (-34.4 Celsius), to polar bears and arctic foxes occasionally roaming local streets, it takes a unique individual to forgo life on the mainland and move to such a remote, and at times forbidding, place. “Every day feels adventurous. It’s going to be crazy or wild or just a regular day,” said Blomdahl, “But a regular day here is so different; it’s drinking coffee with Northern Lights, or midnight sun, or reindeers.” Those are common sentiments within Svalbard’s community — the extreme conditions, while enchanting, means people don’t stick around the area by accident. People from around 50 countries there, working in areas such as scientific research and seasonal tourism. What moves someone to search for a home in such a remote corner of the world? According to , many people who seek out extreme conditions may be motivated by desires to challenge the limits of their physical and psychological abilities, escape personal problems or everyday tedium, or simply for the thrill. For Blomdahl, a glimpse of Svalbard’s unparalleled scenery was all she needed to forsake her corporate ambitions in England and Sweden and opt to live what she describes in her book as a “nature-connected life marked by a slower pace.” “Everything up here is so pure and so beautiful,” Blomdahl said, “you think that it’s some sort of magic because it’s so unreal.” On her social media channels, Blomdahl shows viewers firsthand how Svalbard’s environment shapes her everyday life. For example, not only is it necessary to carry polar bear protection gear when traveling outside designated settlements, it’s legally mandated. In one striking image in her book, she is shown sporting a firearm on her back as she and her dog stand far from the settlements. Blomdahl, who photographed all of the images herself, even caught one of a polar bear near her home — taken from a noticeable distance away, for safety reasons. A year in Svalbard is marked by two unusual periods of light: polar night and midnight sun. Polar night runs from mid-November to the end of January, when the sun doesn’t rise above the horizon. Midnight sun, which lasts about 18 weeks between April and August, is when the sun doesn’t set below the horizon. These periods of constant light and day-long dark can take a toll on the body and mind. Blomdahl recalled how friends, disoriented by polar night, found themselves heading to work in the middle of the night, instead of the equally dark daytime hours. Such abnormal living conditions can have pervasive effects on people’s health. Despite an overall positive outlook on health and quality of life in Svalbard, polar night and midnight sun can disrupt sleep-wake cycles, blood protein levels, and lead to increased risks of chronic disease. Despite taking supplements, Blomdahl says she noticed a drop in her vitamin D levels, which support immune health and brain cell activity. Nonetheless, Blomdahl still says polar night is “one of the best times of year,” where she can “become one with the darkness.” She enjoys the tranquility during that period, but emphasizes the importance of maintaining a positive outlook and staying active during what otherwise could be a lethargic season. “Your mindset is so powerful. I see these dark days as something cozy,” Blomdahl said, “I think it’s very much up to each and every person to try to create that routine and that mindset.” Maintaining an adaptive mindset is also an important way Svalbardians process the unique threat climate change poses to the region. Longyearbyen is warming six times faster than the global average, , and thawing permafrost and rising sea levels threaten the local economy and infrastructure. Studies within other Arctic communities show a correlation between climate change and higher levels of mental stress. In Svalbard, people report a high level of satisfaction with their lives despite environmental challenges, but the complications of climate issues like permafrost thaw can leave some feeling disempowered. Blomdahl notes that an annual environmental survey is conducted in Svalbard to manage risks. As for day-to-day life, Svalbard is sufficiently equipped with the means to sustain its population. Longyearbyen features most of what most cities on the mainland offer, including an airport, a hospital, educational institutions, and more — all crowned the world’s northmost of their institutions. However, given the mission-based work characterizing much of Svalbard’s economy, not to mention the harsh environment, the average stay in Svalbard is only seven years, according to Statistics Norway. Yet this conveniently aligns with a desire not to expand life on Svalbard, according to Blomdahl. Local officials have geared available resources to primarily maintain life on Svalbard as it is, given the environmental and developmental constraints. As for Blomdahl, her positive mindset and love for Svalbard steers her away from dwelling on uncertainty or concern. Instead, she says she’s solely focused on creating educational and peaceful content about her distinctive life in a distinctive place. “That’s just what I want to do,” said Blomdahl, “I want to continue to show the beauty of the Arctic. I just want to show Svalbard the way it is.”",

    "title": "\n      A couple walked from opposite ends of China’s Great Wall and met in the middle. Then they broke up\n    ",

    "content": "The Great Wall of China has inspired countless works of art in its more than 2,000-year history. Among the most famous is “The Great Wall Walk,” a dramatic 90-day performance that saw lovers and Frank Uwe Laysiepen (the late German artist known as Ulay) trek towards each other from opposite ends of the landmark. Abramović began in the east at the so-called “dragon’s head” — where the Great Wall dips into the Bohai Bay like a dragon drinking from the sea — while Ulay started at the “tail,” more than 3,000 miles to her west, in the Gobi Desert. When the idea was initially conceived, under a full moon in Australia’s outback, the pair had planned to meet and get married in the middle. But obtaining permission from Chinese authorities would take over eight years, by which time their romantic relationship, despite having achieved global fame and success as a performance art duo, had fallen apart amid infidelity, jealousy and a failed threesome. Still, neither wanted to give up on the project and, in March 1988, they embarked on their respective journeys. “We both decided that we have to address new circumstances, which means our separation… (We would) say goodbye,” Abramović told CNN on a video call from the Modern Art Museum (MAM) Shanghai, where she her first ever museum exhibition in China this week. “Great love,” she added, encompasses everything: “Love, hate, disappointment, and forgiveness. We explore all of it.” The 77-year-old Serbian artist’s new show, “ ,” features interactive artworks inspired by the Great Wall journey, as well as over 1,200 never-before-seen images taken along the way. The photos, which will be projected onto the museum’s walls, are divided into four categories that curator and MAM’s artistic director Shai Baitel grouped as “the preparation and beginning walk, encounters with locals, walking the wall and meeting Ulay, and staged experiments and landscapes.” Baitel said he was “blown away” by the trove of unpublished film negatives Abramović held in storage. “It is a treasure for a curator, for anyone that is in the business of art, or art history research, (to) document (what has) not been digitized yet but exists there in large quantities.” Abramović is shown traversing through some of the most stunning, wild parts of the wall against a backdrop of mountains, crumbling ruins and varied terrain. There’s a clear sense of isolation — but this loneliness provided space for contemplation and reflection, the artist said, admitting she must have been a “very strange” sight to everyone she encountered. “I was a woman, walking alone… without a husband, without children, not speaking the language,” she recalled. “What am I doing there?” Since planning the exhibition and trawling through her photo archive, the artist has been flooded with memories of the support and hospitality she experienced along the way. “(Local people) were always giving more food… But I couldn’t carry it all. I was given goose eggs, but they are so big, so I would have one in my left pocket and one in my right pocket, to keep balance.” Abramović was prohibited from camping on the wall, so she instead stayed in small villages along the way. In each one, she would try to meet the oldest resident — some well into their 100s — and through a translator who accompanied her, ask them to share their stories about the wall. The Great Wall, which stretches across northern China, was built to keep out invaders, but for the locals Abramović spoke to, its winding shape was less about military history and more to do with an earthly representation of dragons and the Milky Way, she said. The quest became as much spiritual as it was physical. “I realized the old stories are related directly to the minerals that I had been walking on,” the artist said at a press conference in Shanghai. “If I was walking on a ‘black dragon’ that would be on (iron-rich) hematite… a ‘red dragon’ would be clay, it was completely different ground,” she added, explaining that as she walked on various minerals and crystals, she was able to feel different “energies.” The artist’s expansive Shanghai exhibition offers visitors a chance to hold crystal-based objects, a reference to this aspect of her Great Wall journey. The three-floor show also features “durational” installations — like a custom-built metronome that only takes a beat every 24 seconds, and an interactive artwork that invites visitors to repeatedly, and very slowly, open and close a door without entering or exiting. “The works are all contemplative and (are intended) to bring you to another state of mind, and to lift your spirit in a certain way,” Abramović told CNN, adding that she is also challenging the way people experience art in the digital age. “(It’s) so much about technological detox. We never spend time with anything, with ourselves. We are going to immediately take a photograph or something before we even experience what it is, and then go home and look at it.” Three months after they set off, the pair’s paths finally crossed at Shenmu in Shaanxi . According to Abramović, Ulay had stumbled upon an “unbelievable, meaningful” spot located between two temples and waited for her there. It would take Abramović an additional three days to reach him. “I wanted to kill him,” she joked. “For me… I absolutely dedicated myself to this concept… you meet in the exact middle, no matter if it is a better photogenic spot or not. After embracing, the couple parted ways (not before Abramović learned that Ulay had impregnated his Chinese translator during the trip) and did not see each other for another 22 years. That was until 2010, when Ulay surprised Abramović at the Museum of Modern Art in New York during her performance “The Artist is Present,” in which she sat in front of visitors, one at a time, and held their gaze in silence. “I didn’t know he was going to sit with me,” she said, recalling the moment she opened her eyes to find Ulay across the table. “My whole life went to the front of my eyes and I started crying. It was a very strong moment.” Breaking her own rule, she reached across the table and held his hands, an emotional reunion that went viral. The pair’s story didn’t end there — six years later, Ulay sued Abramović for works they created together. But although he died in 2020, their relationship had ended peacefully: In a twist of fate, the ex-lovers wound up at the same silent mediation retreat in India. “You see, the universe has its own ways,” Abramović said, adding that they found space there to truly forgive one another. “He’s not here anymore; I miss him terribly, because it would have been incredible if he was also here to celebrate this show and this reminder of that epic work.”",

    "content": "Even by the standards of watch boxes — typically oversized for the objects they hold — Chopard’s latest leather case, unveiled at watch fair Watches and Wonders, is strikingly large. But the grandeur is justified. Open it, and it reveals not one, but twelve L’Heure du Diamant watches, arranged like precious petals. Each piece features the same diamond-studded bezel, framing twelve different dials crafted from thin, round slices of hard-stones including apple-green jade, cobalt blue agate, cinnamon brown tiger’s eye, white mother-of-pearl, pink opal, onyx, carnelian, and more. The result is an elegant, unmistakably feminine collection with just the right dose of color and sparkle. “My father, Karl Scheufele, introduced exquisite goldsmithing techniques that enabled the use of hard-stone dials when he took over Chopard in 1963,” explained Caroline Scheufele, Chopard’s co-president and creative director, over a phone call. “By the late 1960s, Chopard was already creating bold, colorful timepieces with these beautiful stones. Reviving them now is our way of celebrating that joyful creativity — while staying true to our heritage.” Chopard’s latest creation may be the most eloquent example yet and perhaps the peak of the hard-stone dial craze that has been sweeping the world of luxury watches over the past couple of years. It’s evident at Rolex, which reimagined its beloved Oyster Perpetual Day-Date 36 in uplifting tones of apricot carnelian, sky-blue turquoise and shimmering green aventurine. The watchmaker also updated its iconic Oyster Perpetual collection with a 28mm style, debuting in lavender and a matte finish, a first for the brand. Gucci gave its avant-garde, hands-free Grip timepiece a bold new look in sandstone-hued jasper, while Dior’s Grand Bal Histoire Naturelle features sodalite, aventurine and aragonite. Chanel ventured into the cosmos to fetch meteorite for one of its elegant Monsieur watches. Elsewhere, Cartier’s elongated oval-shaped Baignoire watch has a mesmerizing, hypnotic dial featuring an irregular mosaic of mother-of-pearl, turquoise, and onyx stones. This year, Piaget is also making a colorful splash with hard-stone dials. In one model from the Hidden Treasures collection, a green-hued opal dial peeks out from an intricately engraved white gold cuff, its outer frame rimmed with delicate emeralds. In another piece, a lavish sautoir with a rope-like chain is adorned with a 17-carat pink tourmaline and a white opal of over 12 carats, and holds a dial made of fiery red ruby root — the raw base material to which rubies are attached. The dial’s vivid color is echoed by ruby root beads in juicy cerise and raspberry tones, interspersed throughout the chain. One might associate such colorful hard-stones with ladies’ watches, which have historically featured softer colors or delicate details, but they’re popular in men’s timepieces, too. Piaget recently reimagined its iconic Andy Warhol watch in four striking variations, each featuring a different ornamental stone: blue opal veined with iridescent green, warm brown tiger’s eye, vivid green meteorite, and silvery meteorite. “The distinctive shape of this case offers an ideal canvas for showcasing exceptional slices of ornamental stone,” says Jean-Bernard Forot, head of patrimony at Piaget. “At Watches and Wonders, we’re reintroducing the tiger’s eye on a white gold case — an exquisite pairing that magnifies the stone’s graphic, magnetic stripes.” At the end of last year, Hublot added a bold twist to its muscular Classic Fusion model, unveiling dials crafted from lunar meteorite, pink jasper, turquoise, sodalite and nephrite jade. Now, at the Geneva fair, Gerald Charles — founded by the legendary designer Gerald Genta, who was often dubbed the “Picasso of watchmaking” — presented the Maestro with a radiant lapis lazuli dial. “Lapis lazuli was chosen because it was Mr. Gerald Genta’s favorite stone,” explained the brand’s CEO Federico Ziviani. “We hold the rights to his original sketch, so this design is completely aligned with our brand’s DNA.” But why has the world of horology fallen for colorful hard-stone dials? “Collectors love these dials because they bring individuality to a watch,” explained Scheufele, noting that each stone varies in hue, with unique streaks, inclusions, and shimmering effects that give every piece its own distinct character. The appeal also goes beyond aesthetics.“These stones aren’t just beautiful — they carry meaning,” Scheufele continued. “From birthstones to lucky charms, they hold an almost mythical energy. That emotional connection makes them irresistible.” Alba Cappellieri, head of the jewelry and fashion accessories program at Politecnico University in Milan, believes that collectors’ growing fascination with hard-stone dial watches is closely tied to the broader revival of 1970s aesthetics. This resurgence has been particularly visible in luxury fashion: see the flared trousers, long sautoirs and bold mix of colors and prints seen at the latest shows of Valentino, Chloé and Chanel. “The 1970s marked a break from modernist austerity, ushering in a more fluid, emotional, and decorative aesthetic,” Cappellieri explained, citing Emilio Pucci’s “palazzo pajamas” as a perfect expression of that era’s “relaxed yet sophisticated spirit, with kaleidoscopic prints and lightweight fabrics that drape naturally over the body.” Much like in the 1970s, current rising inflation and geopolitical tensions globally may prompt consumers to seek solace in color as a quick and uplifting antidote. “Saturated hues and vibrant combinations are taking center stage,” Cappellieri continued, adding that the appeal of hard-stones such as lapis lazuli, malachite and mother-of-pearl “goes beyond decoration” and “reflect a desire to celebrate nature and its uniqueness.” However, for all their visual appeal and seemingly effortless ability to inject color into a watch, setting a dial using hard-stones is a delicate and complex process. Despite being classified as “hard,” these stones are, in fact, fragile, explained Piaget’s Forot. “Opal dials are especially tricky — even after passing all the stress tests, the real moment of truth comes when the watch hands are applied to the dial,” he said. “There’s a tiny pressure at the center of the dial, and even the strongest slice can crack.” Still, the risk is worth it. “One glance at a hard-stone dial instantly evokes images of a hedonistic, flamboyant lifestyle,” said Forot. “You can almost feel the warmth just by looking at it.”",

    "content": "LVMH lost its position on Tuesday as Europe’s largest luxury company in terms of market capitalization after being overtaken by rival Hermès due to investor pessimism after disappointing first-quarter revenue from the sector bellwether. LVMH, whose high-end brands include Louis Vuitton and Dior, jewelry brand Tiffany & Co. and beauty chain Sephora, missed expectations for first-quarter sales as US shoppers curbed purchases of beauty products and cognac while sales in China remained weak. LVMH shares dropped 7%, bringing its market capitalization down to €246 billion, compared to €247 billion for Hermès. While market valuations tend to fluctuate, Tuesday’s trading “does reflect diverging performance and investor sentiment about the two companies,” said Jelena Sokolova, senior equity analyst at Morningstar. Sokolova pointed to LVMH’s larger exposure to the lower end of the luxury spectrum, whereas the wealthier client base of Hermes allowed it to better weather an industry downturn. Hermès, which sells $10,000 Birkin and Kelly handbags, is known for its tight hold on production, sticking to a 6-7% increase each year. The overtaking in market cap is “quite telling of the post, post-Covid world,” with LVMH fashion labels enjoying a far greater market share than in the past, having gained ground on rivals during the post-pandemic boom, noted Flavio Cereda, who manages GAM’s Luxury Brands investment strategy. There will be “short term pain for sure” said Cereda, noting Vuitton’s focus more on middle-range luxury goods was an “the area of concern.” LVMH, down 7.2%, led share declines across the sector, with Gucci-owner Kering and Hermès down 2% and 0.3% respectively. Swiss-based Richemont, which owns Cartier, was down 0.7% while Italy’s Prada was down 4.2%. A 3% decline in LVMH’s first-quarter sales — well below analyst expectations for 2% growth — pointed to another difficult year for luxury companies following US President Donald Trump’s recent tariff announcements, which have sparked fears of a recession. The performance signaled “a more difficult trading environment for the broader luxury sector,” said RBC analyst Piral Dadhania, who lowered his organic sales forecast for LVMH this year to flat from growth of 3% expected previously, citing the first-quarter sales miss. Investors had been hoping the luxury sector would pull out of its slump this year, but trade tensions have raised concerns of a global recession. Improvement seen at the end of 2024 now seems an anomaly as LVMH’s key fashion and leather goods business, home to the Louis Vuitton and Dior brands, reverted to 5% sales declines, noted Deutsche Bank. Shares of luxury companies have traded lower since the end of March, with LVMH, Kering and Burberry all down 14%, Richemont down 13% and Hermès down 5%. Bernstein analysts recently lowered their sales forecast for the sector this year to a decline of 2%, against a previous forecast for 5% growth, a drop that would mark the industry’s longest downturn in over two decades.",

    "author": "CNN",
    "publication_date": "2025-04-17T09:19:19.850Z",

    "content": "Set in a sleek, lacquered rectangular casing and adorned with 20 baguette-cut yellow beryls — set in gold, to match the opulent golden chain from which it dangles — Chanel’s latest launch looks like a lipstick at first sight. But there’s more to it. With a click, the lipstick case opens to reveal a watch dial at its center. Named “Kiss Me,” the timepiece is part of the French luxury house’s capsule collection, which was unveiled at the trade fair in Geneva in April. Fusing beauty and horology, the collection also includes “Protect Me,” an amulet-like pendant that reimagines the evil eye as founder Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel’s own kohl-lined gaze, and “Give Me Luck,” a talismanic necklace featuring rubellite cabochons and five pink tourmalines arranged in a Byzantine motif that Chanel herself loved. Twist either pendant and, again, a hidden watch is revealed. Creating timepieces that bear little resemblance to ordinary wristwatches (which traditionally feature a dial plate and hands, and attached by a strap, designed to be worn around the wrist) may seem like an unexpected move for Chanel, known for its classic styles. But it’s part of a broader growing trend that has also extended to the red carpet: See the custom watch choker that Taylor Swift wore around her neck to the Grammy Awards last year. “It’s a new way to wear time — one that celebrates uniqueness and individuality,” said Manon Hagie, sales director of watches at Sotheby’s, on a phone call with CNN. Timepieces in unlikely shapes and sizes featured across the Watches and Wonders fair, which concluded on Monday. Van Cleef & Arpels unveiled a new diamond-studded edition of the Cadenas — a bold, padlock-inspired design with a shackle-like clasp that looks more like a bracelet than a watch — marking the 90th anniversary of one of its most beloved styles. “When you look at it, it’s not immediately clear it’s a watch — and that’s what makes it modern and intriguing,” said Rainer Bernard, head of research and development at Van Cleef & Arpels, attributing the design’s enduring appeal to its dual identity as both a jewel and timepiece. Similarly, the diamond-studded open cuff featuring Cartier’s iconic panther — caught mid-leap, paw outstretched, prowling over its prey — may initially look like a daring adornment. Upon closer inspection, however, the feline sits opposite a discreet watch dial that is only revealed when the piece is tilted by the wearer. These newly introduced Panthère jewelry watches — which also include a pared-down version in gold — play on the silhouette of last year’s Réflection de Cartier. (That model featured a mirrored finish in place of the panther, allowing the time to be read through its reflection, as the name subtly suggests.) Cartier’s appetite for no-watch watches also extends to the men’s department with its revival of the Tank à Guichets. Deceptively minimalist, the new model features neither a dial nor hands — just two tiny apertures, or “guichets” (French for ticket windows), showing the hour and minutes as digits at the top and bottom, respectively. First introduced in 1928 as a reinterpretation of the classic Tank, the limited-edition style returns in 2025 in yellow gold, rose gold and platinum. Unusual-looking timepieces also took center stage at a special Sotheby’s sale in April. Titled Area 51 — a playful nod to the US military site in the Nevada desert, long associated with UFOs and conspiracy theories about alien technology — the auction spotlighted 51 timepieces with uncommon case shapes or made with materials rarely used in watchmaking. Ranging from vintage Patek Philippe models to futuristic creations by independent brands like Urwerk, the lots fetched a combined $1.6 million. For Sotheby’s Hagie, the result reflects “how the watch audience is evolving, with more women and Gen Z collectors entering the space.” Customers looking for less risqué styles may be drawn to pendant watches. All the rage during the Roaring Twenties, when they swung from the lithe frames of bob-haired flapper girls in fringed dresses and lowered waistlines, the style is enjoying a revival amid newfound interest in unusual watch forms, Hagie observed. She linked the trend to nostalgia, but also watchmakers’ growing focus on female clients and their heterogeneous tastes. Indeed, in recent years, Jaeger-LeCoultre and even the sportier Richard Mille have introduced watches designed to swing from one’s neck. Meanwhile, Chanel’s playful new take on its signature octagonal-dial Première watch features an extra-long gold and leather chain designed to wrap not only around the wrist but also the neck. At Piaget — where pendant watches have long been part of the brand’s repertoire — they’re back in the spotlight: This year, the Swiss watchmaker unveiled a model featuring a rope-like gold chain and ruby-root beads, with a ruby-root dial framed by a festoon of spinels and yellow sapphires arranged as a fan. A more pared-down version highlights a trapeze-shaped dial, the core design element of the newly launched Sixtie collection. At Watches and Wonders, they were intentionally displayed next to “patrimony” timepieces from Piaget’s archive that are not for sale, explained Stéphanie Sivrière, the brand’s jewelry and watch artistic director. “We create a fluid narrative where past and present collide — until you forget which is which,” she said, adding that, as of late, pendant watches have “been so successful we can barely keep up with demand.” At more accessible price points, Van Cleef & Arpels has reimagined its signature Alhambra, Perlée and Ludo designs as pendant watches featuring juicy colored gems like turquoise, lapis lazuli and carnelian. Meanwhile, Dior’s jewelry division has introduced pendant versions of its Gem Dior watch — one with jazzy malachite, the other with delicate aragonite — dangling from a thread-thin link-bar chain. “I love the idea of jewelry that tells time,” Victoire de Castellane, Dior Joaillerie’s creative director, wrote to CNN over email. “And I find wearing a watch as a pendant amusing.” A lighthearted approach was also taken by Philippe Delhotal, creative director of Hermès Horloger, who turned the house’s iconic anchor chain motif into a brooch watch, rimmed with diamonds and adorned with a pink tourmaline, as part of the Maillon Libre collection unveiled at the fair. “Historically, watches have also been carried in pockets, worn on ties or styled as brooches. So rather than designing a brooch to hold a watch, we first created the watch itself — then the idea of the brooch came naturally,” Delhotal explained. “It’s a nomadic piece that can be shared or styled differently — pinned as a brooch or worn as a pendant on a sautoir. In doing so, it offers the wearer a spectrum of possibilities.”",

    "content": "A lettercard penned by one of the Titanic’s most well-known survivors from onboard the ship, days before it sank, has sold for £300,000 ($399,000) at auction. In the note, written to the seller’s great-uncle on April 10, 1912, first-class passenger Archibald Gracie wrote of the ill-fated steamship: “It is a fine ship but I shall await my journeys end before I pass judgment on her.” The letter was sold to a private collector from the United States on Saturday, according to auction house Henry Aldridge & Son in Wiltshire, England. The hammer price far exceeded the initial estimate price of £60,000. The letter is believed to be the sole example in existence from Gracie from onboard the Titanic, which sank off Newfoundland after hitting an iceberg, killing about 1,500 people on its maiden voyage. Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge described it as an “exceptional museum grade piece.” Gracie, who jumped from the ship and managed to scramble onto an overturned collapsible boat, was rescued by other passengers onboard a lifeboat and was taken to the R.M.S. Carpathia. He went on to write “The Truth about the Titanic,” an account of his experiences, when he returned to New York City. Gracie boarded the Titanic in Southampton on April 10, 1912, and was assigned first-class cabin C51. His book is seen as one of the most detailed accounts of the events of the night the ship sank, Aldridge said. Gracie did not fully recover from the hypothermia he suffered, and died of complications from diabetes in late 1912. The letter was postmarked Queenstown, Ireland, one of two stops the Titanic made before sinking.",

    "content": "doesn’t feel like the most 21st century profession. The job requires unwavering patience and a delicate touch, with watchmakers taking months or even years to create a single timepiece. Meanwhile, most people tell the time by looking at their phones. But this seemingly bygone profession appears to be enjoying a resurgence of interest triggered, at least in part, by Gen-Z’s enthusiasm for — and a desire for work far away from computer screens. For decades, the industry has warned of a labor shortage as older watchmakers retire. Experts spoken to by CNN, however, report promising levels of interest in the profession, despite ongoing worries over the departure of baby boomers across different specialties. Online watch communities have helped foster a new generation of horology enthusiasts, as connoisseurs young and old , and advertise second-hand and vintage watches for sale on platforms like TikTok Shop. This has generated demand not only for watchmakers, but for the expert repairers needed to revive treasures of the past, said Johann Kunz-Fernandez, director of the Watchmakers of Switzerland Training and Educational Program ( ), in a phone call with CNN. Young people could be a “saving point” to help reinvigorate the watch industry, added Kunz-Fernandez, who was struck by the uptick in their attendance at this year’s Watchers and Wonders, a major watch fair held annually in Geneva, Switzerland. “What I saw and discussed with some watch producers … is that there are a lot of young people, very young people, which is interesting because it absolutely was not the case before,” he said of the event. But how can they turn a passion for watches into a career? , the Finnish School of Watchmaking in Espoo, Finland, has been training students to break into the industry since 1944. One of the most renowned watchmaking schools, it prides itself on producing “the steadiest hands in the world,” said principal Hanna Harilainen. The school has experienced so much demand that it is offering an English-language course for the first time in its 80-year history. Prospective students have registered interest from Canada, the US, the UK, Turkey, South Korea and Iran, among others, Harilainen said. Harilainen credits some of this demand to a growing interest in “micro-brands” founded by independent watchmakers. “Young people … want to create something of their own,” she told CNN over the phone. “Something durable, not to be used and tossed away.” They also bring fresh ways of engaging with the craft, Harilainen added. One of Kelloseppäkoulu’s recent graduates, for instance, co-founded a popular independent watch brand and regularly livestreams watchmaking sessions on Twitch. “My feeling is that new generations are looking for something that makes sense for them,” said Aurélie Streit, vice president of the (FHH), a Swiss non-profit that works on preserving and disseminating watchmaking knowledge. The hands-on nature of the job also appeals: “You can see the pieces, it’s easy to understand what you are doing, and the impact of (it),” she said, adding that FHH often hears from prospective young watchmakers who don’t want to spend all day at a screen. Streit is cautiously optimistic — not only for the prospects of young watchmakers but for other professions vital to the craft, like polishing and micro-mechanics. Her organization plans to showcase these jobs as part of an interactive exhibition in Geneva this June that will give attendees an opportunity to try out different tasks. When Bernhard Lederer decided to become a watchmaker in the 1970s, no one could understand why he wanted to do it. The “quartz crisis,” brought on by the popularity of battery-powered watches, was severely impacting the Swiss economy and it felt hard to see mechanical watches ever making a comeback. “I have been treated a little bit like an extra-terrestrial — like a non-conventional person,” said Lederer of his choice to train as a watchmaker, which he calls “the most beautiful profession I can imagine.” But as the years went by, Lederer appeared to be vindicated. His watches, which can take anywhere between a few months and years to make, now retail for upwards of﻿ $150,000. He credits the pandemic for helping revive interest in independent watchmakers, as collectors had time to learn more about the industry and to shop for pieces “personalized according to (their) taste,” rather than choosing “industrial luxury” from well-known brands, he told CNN over the phone. Among the young talents following in Lederer’s footsteps are Johannes Kallinich and Thibault Claeys, who met while working at luxury watchmaker A. Lange & Söhne before founding their watch company, Kallinich Claeys, in 2022. The duo, who are based in Glashütte, a German town renowned for a watchmaking tradition that dates to 1845, saw an opportunity to “breathe new life into traditional watchmaking,” according to their brand’s website. They achieve this by combining classic and modern materials, such as German silver (a copper-nickel-zinc alloy) with stainless steel. Kallinich Claeys’ other innovations include a “world-first” in the craft: placing the power reserve indicator on the side of the case — rather than on the dial, which is typical of most wristwatches — to give the dial a “cleaner look” while allowing the wearer to better see the mechanical movement. Taking a new approach to watchmaking can be a “stressful” process, according to 28-year-old Claeys who makes the parts and handles the finishings, while 32-year-old Kallinich designs and assembles the pieces. “People will only buy it if they find it beautiful,” he told CNN over a video call. The risk appears to be paying off. At this year’s Watches and Wonders, Kallinich said observers remarked on the timepieces’ distinctly “German” design while appreciating the brand’s innovation. But despite the interest, the pair’s supply is limited, for now: The painstakingly detail-oriented work means they only plan to make 10 to 12 watches a year, bolstered by support from two employees and a third due to join later this year. While machines could complete some of their tasks, like finishings, the difference between hand- and machine-chamfering (polishing sharp edges into flat, angled surfaces) is obvious, said Kallinich, emphasizing the importance of retaining a human touch. More than just functional watches, these are “small artworks” with “heart and soul” put into them, said Claeys. “The craftsmanship, the emotions and the love behind the details … is something I believe machines will never do,” added Kallinich. It’s not just young people embarking upon the profession. Others are coming to it later in life, reviving a dormant passion or escaping desk jobs. Kunz-Fernandez recalled one aspiring watchmaker enrolling on a WOSTEP course after 40 years as a banker. “What is common is the fact that most of them, at a moment in their life, said, ‘What am I doing?’” he said of the programs’ students. At Watches and Wonders in Geneva, CNN sees some of luxury brand Hermes' playful designs, and meets independent watchmaker Raymond Weil and watch content creator Nico Leonard, who sees opportunity in embracing change. Tiina Virtanen, who is due to graduate from the Finnish School of Watchmaking this spring, came to her new profession after 18 years as a civil engineer. Virtanen, 46, said she was “halfway” through her career when she started questioning whether it was what she wanted to do until retirement. “Instead of being in front of a computer all day long, I was longing for something to do with handcrafting,” she wrote in an email to CNN. Upon graduation, she intends to move to Norway to work in a store that repairs and services watches. Her classmate, Jatta Berggren, also came to the school by way of a previous career — as an entrepreneur in the yarn and handicraft industries. “As the work changed over the years, from handmaking to working with computers, I decided to fulfil my dream of studying to be a watchmaker,” Berggren told CNN. “I get the most joy from working with my hands and being able to see the results of my work.” Berggren, 39, sees watchmaking as an industry that “combines the old and the new in a wonderful way,” emphasizing the need for people from different ages and backgrounds to enter the profession so it can continue to develop. As women in a male-dominated industry, Virtanen and Berggren are a minority in their classrooms and the upper echelons of the profession they hope to enter — but this doesn’t appear to daunt th﻿em. There are also promising signs of change: The school has experienced growing interest among women, who made up a third of this year’s applicants. Historically, women have long been present in watchmaking (their smaller hands were sometimes seen as beneficial for those working on factory lines or aiding their watchmaker husbands). FHH’s Streit said there has been “gender parity” in the industry since the 1960s, with women constituting 50% of the workforce in watchmaking factories — though they were primarily “operators,” with the position of “watchmaker” largely held by men. Today, women remain underrepresented in the industry, according to young female watchmaker Shona Taine, who is among those bucking the trend. “There are few other young independent women in the business, but not many,” Taine said. Earlier this month, the 27-year-old became the first woman — and youngest person — admitted to the , a prestigious association of independent watchmakers. An encounter with Prague’s famous astronomical clock during a childhood vacation inspired the French-born, Switzerland-based watchmaker to understand how it functioned. She started training at 15 and set up her own business at 22 upon realizing that no company would give her freedom to develop the “lots of watches in my mind.” “I had all the fire and energy of a very young woman,” she wrote to CNN in an email, explaining her decision to go independent. “I had no idea of the scale of the task,” she added, nor any idea “what it would be like to set up business in a man’s world.” Last year, Taine was a in Louis Vuitton’s Watch Prize for Independent Creatives and she is now working on 12 editions of her first independently made watch. Called Khemea (“alchemy” in Greek), the first model took her three years to develop and retails for 89,000 Swiss francs ($107,000). Her university studies in philosophy and literature are evident in its design: A poem written in the movement’s cogs only aligns a few times a year (when the moon cycle and Gregorian calendar cycle meet) and can only be read if the watch is taken apart. “We’re not reinventing the wheel,” she said of her creation, “but we’re putting it together in a new way.” When Taine compares being a watchmaker now to previous generations, she admits the profession is less about necessity. But, with that, comes artistic freedom. In today’s world, she sees the craft as “an artistic field in its own right,” adding that watches’ social status, as non-essential luxury items, affords makers like her “more freedom, more extravagance, more self-expression.” When asked about being one of the few young women in her profession, Taine said it’s often other people, not her, who bring up gender. “Personally, I think it’s cool,” she said of her place in the industry. Buyers and collectors can, however, be “apprehensive,” she added. “It’s a lot of little remarks that I have to deal with and ignore.” But none of this is a deterrent for Taine, who sees her vocation as a “way of life.” “It takes longer to convince the general public that a woman can be just as talented in precision engineering as a man,” she said. “But the time will come, I’m sure.”",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story ran on May 6. It was updated following the auction’s postponement. Sotheby’s has postponed the controversial sale of a dazzling cache of jewels linked to the remains of the Buddha after India’s government slammed the auction and called for the gems’ return. In a statement emailed to CNN on Wednesday, the auction house said its decision came “in light of the matters” raised by officials in India, where the jewels were dug up more than a century ago by a British colonial official. The postponement, which Sotheby’s said was agreed to by the sellers, will “allow for discussions between the parties,” the statement added. The collection of “gem relics” — including amethysts, pearls, carnelians, shell and embossed gold sheets — was set to go up for auction in Hong Kong on Wednesday. Described by Sotheby’s auction house as having “unparalleled religious, archaeological and historical importance,” the gem relics are considered sacred by many Buddhists, who believe they are the corporeal remains of the Buddha. “Nothing of comparable importance in early Buddhism has ever appeared at auction,” Sotheby’s had earlier said on its website. The web page dedicated to the sale has since been taken down. The gems were being sold by three descendants of William Claxton Peppé, a British colonial engineer who made the extraordinary discovery in the village of Piprahwa after excavating part of his estate in northern India in 1898. Though the Buddha was born in what is now Nepal, he became enlightened, first preached, and died in neighboring India. On Monday, India’s Ministry of Culture said it was taking “swift and comprehensive” measures to “immediately” stop the sale and “highlight the illegality of the auction and ensure compliance with international laws.” It also called on Sotheby’s to “return these sacred artifacts to their rightful place.” In a brief statement posted to Facebook on Wednesday, the ministry welcomed the auction house’s decision to postpone the sale, adding: “Further details will be shared in due course.” Peppé’s Birdpur estate was located in what is now northern Uttar Pradesh, about 20 kilometers from Lumbini, the Buddha’s birthplace across the border in Nepal. His excavation of the site uncovered an ancient Buddhist stupa and a huge sandstone sarcophagus-like tomb. Inside the cavern were five vessels containing about 1,800 gemstones and precious metals, dating to around 240 BCE, and small pieces of bone and ash. An inscription on one of the urns indicated the remains belonged to the Buddha, who had his ashes buried at eight separate sites following his death around 480 BCE. Historians the site was the first credible find of the Buddha’s relics in modern times and captured the imagination of Buddhist scholars and devotees ever since. “These gem relics (in all likelihood contributed by the Buddha’s clansmen), are, by association, as valuable as the ash and bone pieces (of the Buddha) themselves that were found alongside them,” said Karam Tej S. Sarao, former professor and head of the department of Buddhist Studies at the University of Delhi. The gems put up for auction were a small portion of the original find. Following the discovery, the bone and ash fragments were gifted by the British to King Chulalongkorn of Siam, now Thailand. They are now spread across important Buddhist sites in Thailand, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. Most of the gems were sent to an Indian museum in Kolkata, according to the Indian government, and a fifth of the total find — consisting of duplicates of the main collection — were retained by Peppé. The upcoming sale of the gems handed down to Peppé’s descendants had sparked criticism among several historians. “There is a limit to greed. Commercialization… of the relic gems must be stopped,” said Sarao, the former professor. “The gems should be immediately handed over to the Indian government” to be “enshrined in the Piprahwā Stūpa where they belong,” he added. Curator Conan Cheong and Professor Ashley Thompson of SOAS, University of London, both specialists in Southeast Asian Buddhist art, wrote in a that the sale amounted to “perpetuating colonial violence.” The relics are considered the “corporeal remains imbued with the living presence of the Buddha” and so, “for the Buddhists who deposited them, as for many Buddhists today, gems, bone and ash are all relics,” they wrote. Chris Peppé, great grandson of William Claxton Peppé, and two of his cousins now have possession of the gem relics. Since inheriting them in 2013, the family have “sought to make them available for viewing by the public (ideally a Buddhist public).” Through the , the family has made research on the gem relics available to the public and the gems have been exhibited in museums around the world. Prior to the auction’s postponement, Chris Peppé told CNN that his family believe the 334 items in their possession should go to Buddhists. “Despite exhibitions in major museums including the Met, there has been relatively little interest from the public (including Buddhists) in the gems. Choosing temples and museums for donation all presented different problems on closer scrutiny,” he said. “The auction seems to have finally brought the gems into the spotlight and may present the fairest and most transparent way to transfer this small part of the original find to Buddhists. Chris Peppé said 25% of the proceeds from the auction were due to be donated to “Buddhist institutions” and a further 25% to the display of the main Piprahwa collection in Kolkata, which has never been exhibited to the public. CNN’s Oscar Holland contributed to this story.",

    "content": "Millie Bobby Brown has spoken out against a series of articles criticizing her appearance during her ongoing press tour for the Netflix film, “The Electric State.” On Monday, the “Stranger Things” actor posted a video on Instagram where she called out the media for “bullying” and “tearing young women down,” and addressed each journalist that had scrutinized her looks by name. Over the past week, Brown has been the subject of several articles after she debuted while promoting her new film. While the platinum look, paired with ‘90s and Y2K-inspired ensembles, generated excitement among fans who hoped that it was Brown’s way of hinting at her role in a Britney Spears biopic, other the actor for having “aged far beyond her years.” Brown, whose career in the entertainment industry began at 10 years old, fired back at articles that questioned the changes in her appearance as she matured. Among those she called out had headlines such as “What has Millie Bobby Brown done to her face?” and “Millie Bobby Brown mistaken for someone’s mom as she guides younger sister Ava through LA”. “I grew up in front of the world, and for some reason, people can’t seem to grow with me,” said . “Instead, they act like I’m supposed to stay frozen in time, like I should look the way I did on ‘Stranger Things’ Season 1. And now because I don’t, I’m a target.” Brown, now 21, pointed out that the focus on her looks was not only cruel but reflected the unrealistic standards directed at young women. “The fact that adult writers are spending their time dissecting my face, my body, my choices, it’s disturbing,” she said. “The fact that some of these articles are written by women? Even worse.” She isn’t the only star who has fought back at judgmental comments made about their appearance in recent years. In 2023, to Instagram after photos of her performing at the Grammys went viral — sparking comments that she was “obsessed with plastic surgery” (the singer has never publicly addressed rumors of cosmetic enhancements). The 66-year-old musician wrote that “ageism and misogyny… permeates the world we live in,” adding that the world “refuses to celebrate women past the age of 45.” Brown’s Instagram video — which, at the time of writing, has 1.6 million likes, accumulated in less than 12 hours — has received an outpour of support from A-listers such as Sarah Jessica Parker, Sharon Stone, Matthew Modine and Winnie Harlow. Brown herself ended the post on a defiant note: “I refuse to apologize for growing up,” she said. “Let’s do better. Not just for me, but for every young girl who deserves to grow up without fear of being torn apart for simply existing.”",

    "content": "Kim Haberly’s dark blonde hair hangs behind her shoulders away from her face. Her almond-shaped eyes are faintly ringed by the yellow tone of an almost-healed bruise. There are two thumb-sized divots next to her hairline (barely perceptible until she points it out) from her recent temple lift, a cosmetic surgery that lifts the outer brow. Ironically, her swollen face looks plump and round despite her partial buccal fat removal — a procedure that extracts the soft pads of tissue found inside the cheeks to create a slimmer face. Still, she could pop to the store without raising so much as an eyebrow from on-lookers. It’s not until Haberly turns her face to the right and raises the camera close to her ear, displaying two freshly sutured incisions, that you might suspect she is fresh out of a facelift. “I’ve woken up really swollen today because I slept on my side,” Haberly told CNN over a video call from her hotel in Turkey. Last month, Haberly traveled over 7,700 miles from her home in Perth, Australia to receive one of the most invasive facial surgeries available: a deep plane facelift. The advanced lifting technique — which has become a favorite of specialist surgeons for its apparent longer lasting results — not only repositions the top layer of skin (known as an endoscopic facelift) but also the complex network of tissue and fibrous muscles below. At 37, Haberly, who also had a neck lift operation, is almost a decade more junior than the youngest average facelift candidate in Australia, and in the eyes of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), is at least a whopping 18 years ahead of schedule. ​​It’s not a rejuvenation strategy. It’s a beautification strategy. Dr. Zelken, certified plastic surgeon Traditionally used to reduce signs of aging, the facelift is often associated with those in later life. , almost 60% of facelift patients in 2023 were aged between 55 and 69, according to ASPS. Similarly Generation X, which encompasses those aged from 45 to 60, were the primary age group seeking out facelifts in that same year, research from the Australasian College of Cosmetic Surgery and Medicine shows. And although there is no published data on the average age of a facelift patient in the UK, ) recently reported the procedure is “more common among those 50 and above.” Yet, in the last few years, an increasing number of younger people have been seeking out the surgery — not as an anti-aging method but to finesse their features, having grown up in an extremely digital world where their physical appearances are constantly on show. According to the ASPS, of facelift patients in 2023 aged between 20-29 and 30-39 each jumped by 7% compared to the previous year, while those from the 40-54 age group grew by just 3%. Dr. Jonathan Zelken, a board-certified plastic surgeon based in Newport Beach, California, who has performed a number of facelifts, has found that some of his clients in their 20s and 30s “want sharper jaw lines, sharper cheeks, sharper brows,” he told CNN over the phone. Rather than eliminate wrinkles, their goal is to enhance their existing appearance, Dr. Zelken explained. “​​It’s not a rejuvenation strategy. It’s a beautification strategy.” The first known facelift was performed at Berlin’s Charite Hospital over 120 years ago. In 1901, an intrepid German doctor called Eugene von Holländer was approached by a Polish aristocrat looking for smoother skin. With her hands clasped to the sides of her face, the well-to-do woman is said to have demonstrated her request by lifting the corners of her mouth and cheeks. But Holländer was initially reluctant to operate, given that no such operation existed. Ultimately, as he recorded in his 1912 medical paper, he fell victim to “the art of feminine persuasion” and readied his scalpel. While there is little public information about patient zero, including her name, Holländer’s notes of her “aging wrinkles” and “drooping cheeks” suggest she was around the age of a prototypical candidate. Over a century later, the surgery is breaking new ground once again. This time, with those under 40. It’s a controversial procedure, but Dr. Zelken is largely in support of the newfound interest from this burgeoning demographic, whose operations have produced some of his “favorite” results. “It’s almost like you are doing a filter for social media in real life by doing these procedures,” said Dr. Zelken, who was hesitant to share the cost of his work, but pointed to Southern California’s ballpark range of $30,000 to $100,000 per facelift. While he acknowledged that a 20-something year old looking for a facelift would be a “yellow flag,” he wouldn’t be deterred solely on that. “It’s hard to put an age minimum on this procedure,” Dr. Zelken reasoned. Even where there are no drooping cheeks or aging wrinkles, “you can achieve really attractive change,” he said. I really wanted to enhance myself, just to feel good about myself again Emily Cipryk, facelift patient That’s also the opinion of some facelift patients. Emily Cipryk was 28 years old when she flew from Toronto, Canada to Istanbul, Turkey for a deep plane mid-facelift — a procedure that raises the tissue and skin around the corner of eyes as well as cheeks. “I really wanted to enhance myself, just to feel good about myself again,” she told CNN on a phone call. Cipryk’s previous job in financial technology during the pandemic meant she was on Zoom calls for hours a day, with her face constantly reflected back at her. “I partied a lot, from university until my late 20s, and it caught up with me… I just didn’t look good,” she said. Cipryk received a total of six surgeries at once, including a blepharoplasty, lip lift, a rhinoplasty and partial buccal fat removal, which cost a total of €13,000 (about $14,140). The process was entirely financed by her fiancé, who also traveled with her to Turkey. “I did six procedures at once so I could just get it all done,” said Cipryk. She noted that she was “very happy” with the results. While Cipryk’s procedures went well, she cautioned others to “be careful” when selecting a surgeon in Turkey. “People get ahead of themselves and think, ‘Oh, it’s so cheap, I can afford it.’ And they might go to someone who’s not even a real plastic surgeon,” she said. “I’ve heard of people going to a real estate agent to get a hair transplant (because) they’re not doing their research.” In 2023, the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons published a joint with the Turkish Society of Plastic Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons warning of a rise in “serious complications and even deaths” linked to the “significant increase in numbers of patients travelling abroad for aesthetic plastic surgery.” Using plastic surgery to maintain a youthful and symmetric appearance is not a new concept. Cosmetic procedures were first popularized in the early 20th century by Hollywood actors concerned with enhancing their on-screen appearance. But with the advent of social media and and the popularization of selfies, the pressures once reserved for those on the world stage now affect many individuals. Catherine*, a 33-year-old from Southern California, spends much of her time on Instagram and TikTok. “I’m watching videos of girls who are in their early 20s that are Instagram influencers and also celebrities who get the best work done,” she told CNN over a phone call. “So, you’re looking at all these people who are a lot younger and they’re perfect, and you’re really chasing that, even though that’s maybe not attainable for the average person.” For Haberly, the desire for a facelift was partly born out of the rapid weight loss she achieved through semaglutide injections, which led her to drop about 15 pounds. Around three years ago, she started to notice loose skin around her jawline and began using sports tape — designed to support muscles and ligament injuries — to hide these areas. It also didn’t help that as part of Haberly’s job as a hair colorist, she would often film her clients’ coloring sessions and post them on Instagram. Despite not being the focal point of the video, Haberly would often receive disparaging comments such as “You look haggard, you look old.” Haberly recounted: “That was probably more when the camera was lower. I would always know when I was going to get those (comments) because I could see myself when I posted that video.” Ultimately, Haberly opted to undergo a facelift surgery, as she hoped it would “help the longevity of my career, which is really important.” Some surgeons are more wary of operating on younger patients. Haberly initially struggled to access the type of facelift she wanted in Australia — a country which requires a psychiatric test prior to a . She passed her mental health checks but was warned by local doctors on having a drastic procedure at her age. One surgeon offered an alternative, less invasive option that involved repositioning the skin rather than removing it entirely. Harberly was recommended by another doctor to wait until she was 50 for a facelift — but she didn’t want to reverse the clock, she wanted to pause it. “I want it now while I’m traveling the world and I’m out there and my face is everywhere,” she said. A similar sentiment was shared by Naomi*, a 45-year-old patient of Dr. Zelken’s who had a deep plane facelift last year. “I want to enjoy it now,” she told CNN. “I don’t want to wait until things get worse and worse… Let’s get ahead of it.” I don’t want to wait until things get worse and worse… Let’s get ahead of it. Naomi*, facelift patient On why a facelift appealed to her, Catherine explained: “I went through eight years of school plus grad school. I think the stress starts to show on you.” She added that she also felt insecure about some “asymmetry” caused by a medically necessary neck operation in her 20s, and after years of consistent Botox and laser therapy, she wanted “something that was 100% guaranteed to give me a result.” Catherine’s operation, which took place at her local clinic and included a lower face and deep plane neck lift, as well as the extra expense of overnight monitoring from a nurse, cost between $25,000 and $30,000. However, there’s reason to be cautious, according to Dr. Kelly Killeen, a board-certified plastic surgeon based in Beverly Hills. “The older population, they’re looking at the surgery because they want to restore something they had in their youth. Whereas younger people are sometimes chasing something that doesn’t exist,” she told CNN over a phone call. Face-tuning apps play a role in this, Killeen explained, pointing to facial laxity — a term used by surgeons to refer to looser skin — as an example that may seem unappealing but is expected with daily movement and neck function. “It doesn’t feel normal (to younger patients) because with the way people edit their photos and shoot their videos, you can’t sometimes see that celebrities have laxity in (physical) areas (that) bend,” explained Killeen, pointing to the neck and jaw as examples. Whether young facelift patients encounter greater risks than those in their 50s and 60s is disputed from surgeon to surgeon. In Dr. Zelken’s view, surgery complications such as nerve damage or muscle paralysis could be felt more deeply by a younger patient, as opposed to someone older. I remember saying to my mom, ‘What if I die from this pain?’ Kim Haberly, facelift patient One disadvantage of starting young is the higher likelihood of repeat operations, warned Californian surgeon Dr. Carl Truesdale. “Someone who is searching for a facelift when they’re younger are less tolerant of age in their face, so they’re going to be more sensitive to seeing age in their face when they’re older, right?” he said. The more surgeries that are performed over a lifetime, the higher potential there is for traumatized tissue, Dr. Truesdale added, noting that revision operations are inherently more challenging. He estimated that last year he turned down facelift operations for around 50 people under the age of 40, with the reason that they “don’t need it.” Determined to undergo the procedure, Haberly eventually scheduled a virtual consultation with a doctor in Turkey, communicating with a receptionist via Whatsapp and sending through photos of her face, pinching her skin and moving her head as directed. Her surgeon in Istanbul then sent through a procedure plan along with the price — $19,425 — and she flew overseas. When Haberly woke up the day after her surgery, the sensation in her body was unbearable. The swelling and bruising she went on to experience was underestimated by doctors, who weaned her off pain medication prematurely, leading to “excruciating pain” as a result, she said. “For two days straight, I was shaking (and) trembling,” Haberly recalled. Watching the clock on the hospital wall in a foreign country, minutes seemed to stretch into hours. “I remember saying to my mom, ‘What if I die from this pain? What if this pain never goes away?’” she said. By day five, Haberly didn’t require any more pain relief. “I’d never recommend anyone do this. But you know, pain becomes distant,” she said. “I can see how happy I’m going to be with the results.”",

    "content": "has withdrawn a controversial that allowed users to alter their photos to make themselves look heavier. Each AI-filtered video on the app follows the same pattern. It starts with an unedited photo of the user—usually slim—before the “chubby filter” trickles down the screen, altering the subject’s physique, while the song “Anxiety” by American rapper and singer-songwriter Doechii plays. As more and more of these videos appeared, a backlash built from users concerned about an implicit body-shaming message. People began commenting on them—“this trend is mean girl coded,” wrote one user, whose comment received more than 5,000 likes. TikToker sadiebass16 said in a : “Imagine you’re just trying to exist on this app and you see thousands of people using an AI filter to have a body that looks like your body, shaming it and all the comments being like ‘ugh, imagine.’ A lot of people can imagine.” Luna, a health and wellbeing app for teens, also for promoting “body shaming and unhealthy beauty standards.” CNN has reached out to TikTok for comment. The company told the BBC it had removed the filter from its app and that it was reviewing videos that featured the filter, making them ineligible for recommendation and blocking them from teen accounts. TikTok added that the filter was uploaded by a company called CapCut, which is a separate entity but has the same parent company, ByteDance. A search Monday morning for “chubby filter” brought up no results on the phone app. However, a search on the desktop version still threw up some content. There are hundreds of filters on TikTok, and many are harmless—for example, adding bunny ears or a dog nose to a face. However, the app’s beauty filters have been widely criticized as damaging to users’ self-esteem. One such filter smoothes out wrinkles, supposedly returning users to their teenage selves but potentially playing into ageist beauty tropes. The chubby filter, critics say, reinforces the widely perceived connection between beauty and thinness. A TikToker who posts under the name SaffsStuff took the filter to task in a video that has received more than 100,000 views: “I don’t think it’s funny, I don’t think it’s light-hearted. I think it’s part of this bigger problem of diet culture and heroin chic really becoming a proper, proper trend on social media at the moment.” One small study from 2019 linked the use of social media filters with higher acceptance of cosmetic surgery, while researchers from Harvard Business Review found in 2021 that people with high confidence in their looks can actually be more unsettled by seeing “improvements” to their face than those who already had insecurities. TikTok announced last November that children under the age of 18 would no longer have access to beauty filters following a report it commissioned that investigated the impact of these effects on young people.

    "content": "When Zach Gilyard, an art director in Brooklyn, got his first tattoo as a senior in high school, he did what most teenagers do and didn’t tell his parents. But not for the reasons you might think — Gilyard’s father and older siblings are all heavily tattooed, and Gilyard, like his mother, thought he would never join them. But on a whim 2006, he got a winged foot on his ankle to represent running, and kept it hidden around his family. “It was not very me,” he said in a phone call, of getting inked. “I kind of liked that it was a bit of a thrill for me, because it was a time where I couldn’t control the situation. I was doing something permanent.” Twelve years and several tattoos later, Gilyard abruptly decided to reverse course shortly after beginning a black-ink traditional patchwork sleeve on his left arm, starting with a panther head on his shoulder. It was big and bold, as intended, but left Gilyard feeling unsettled. “I always had a bit of buyer’s remorse every time I got one. It would last a week or two, and then I’d be happy that I did it,” he said. But this time, the feeling didn’t subside. “I had it for maybe a month, and I freaked out about it — it sent me into a whole panic. I couldn’t explain why. I just didn’t want it, so I told myself in that moment that I was going to get rid of it.” Roughly a quarter of people regret at least one of their tattoos, according to a 2023 Pew Research surveying nearly 8,500 people in the US, as well as a smaller, separate conducted in Turkey published the previous year. But it’s only fairly recently that tattoo removal has become more reliable and widely available. (This writer can attest to that; in 2008, she had a self-administered teenage stick-and-poke lasered off. It was an ordeal.) Celebrities have often drawn attention for their disappearing ink: Angelina Jolie famously removed Billy Bob Thorton’s name after their divorce in 2003; Megan Fox lasered off her portrait of Marilyn Monroe; and Pharrell told in 2008 he was trying an experimental alternative that involved growing new skin. Most recently, Pete Davidson appeared newly bare-chested in a Valentine’s Day campaign for Reformation while , though following the ad revealed he is still sporting lots of faded ink. In Gilyard’s case, he wasn’t lasering hundreds of tattoos, but it has taken more than half a decade and several thousand dollars to remove a handful of them, including the stubborn, highly saturated panther head. Now, that’s nearly gone, showing only a ghostly impression against the freckles on his skin. Other, smaller designs are even further along and barely noticeable to him, he said. “Results do vary, person to person, tattoo to tattoo,” said laser technician and tattoo artist Tim Goergen, who has been treating Gilyard at his shop, Gotham Tattoo Removal, in Brooklyn. Tattoo ink sits in the dermis layer, or second layer, of the skin permanently because ink molecules are “too big for the body to break down,” Goergen explained in a phone interview. Laser machines release fast pulses of energy that heat and break the ink down into tinier particles, triggering an immune response that processes them through the lymphatic system. (A in Sweden has linked tattoos — and their removal — with an increased risk for lymphoma, though its authors said more research is needed.) Tattoos that are easier to remove are usually older, made of black ink, have finer lines, and sit closer to the heart where there’s better blood flow, he said. Goergen charges between $100 and $450 for an individual session, while Removery, a national chain, cites $100-615 on its website. It’s difficult to predict  how many sessions a client’s desired results will take, whether that’s fading a tattoo for a cover-up or complete removal, Goergen noted, “because everybody’s different.” Why people remove their tattoos is often as idiosyncratic as why they get them. Sasha Goldbas-Nazarian, who lives in Los Angeles, decided to start laser treatments when she met her now-husband, who shares her Jewish faith but comes from a more conservative, Iranian family. Interpretations of the Torah, as well as associations with the Holocaust, have led tattoos to long be considered forbidden or taboo within Judaism, though contemporary attitudes towards it have somewhat shifted. “When we first met, he didn’t believe that I was Jewish because I had tattoos,” Goldbas-Nazarian recalled with a laugh. “He was like, ‘I’ve never really met any Jews that have tattoos.’” He eventually offered to pay to remove her most visible tattoos, which she said were “younger decisions” made when she was in high school and college, including a star on her ankle done — unprofessionally — by her friend with a tattoo machine; a horseshoe and star on her upper back; and the initials “UWS” for New York’s Upper West Side, where she grew up, on her wrist. (Disclosure: This writer is a childhood friend of Goldbas-Nazarian, and a former colleague of Gilyard). Goldbas-Nazarian accepted, partly because her tattoos were faded and blurred and often invited questions, and partly because covering them with makeup for formal events had become a hassle during their relationship. But she didn’t anticipate how long it would take — or that it would be much more painful than getting tattooed in the first place, despite the fact that the laser sessions only last a handful of minutes each. “Even though (the sessions are) fast, it’s still really painful. And you can smell your skin burning a little bit, which grossed me out,” she recalled. She’s gone for the treatments on and off for years but has had to pause for an extended period while pregnant, per the medical spa’s policies, and as a new mom. She has no desire to rush back, either. “Honestly, even though I still have a lot of sessions to do, I’ve been putting it off just because of how painful it is,” she said. Though tattooing might typically bring to mind large, custom artworks or small flash pieces,  cosmetic tattoos have become popular for their ability to enhance facial features and makeup —  a so-called “semi-permanent” option for people wanting to remove the daily hassle of filling in their eyebrows or adding beauty marks. But, cosmetic tattooing, which uses an alternative ink meant to produce a more natural finish on the skin, comes with its own set of challenges — as Z, who lives in the UK and prefers to go by her first initial to remain anonymous, discovered around three years ago. Her tattoos were tiny, resembling freckles across her forehead, nose and cheeks to replace natural ones she’d lost due to a rare side effect from a severe illness. She knew she would lose her hair during treatment, she said, but wasn’t aware that her complexion would drastically change. “Growing up, I had a face full of freckles — my nickname was actually ‘Freckles,’” Z said in a phone interview. “Then I got quite poorly, and basically my freckles and all my moles faded away. And so when I was well again, I felt really weird about my face, because it felt so bare.” After she came across a YouTube video of cosmetic freckle tattooing, she thought she would be able to get her freckles back. “But it went very wrong for me,” she said, explaining that the results didn’t feel natural. “You could tell that they were drawn on.” Unpleased with the outcome, she would cover them with makeup, but they still showed through. Cosmetic tattoo ink is meant to eventually fade, but it doesn’t always. It also runs the risk of turning into other colors such as pink or orange over time, or when treated with laser. Z said she did her research and requested regular tattoo ink, but she does not believe her practitioner honored that request. Having more melanated skin put Z at a higher risk of hypopigmentation, a loss of skin pigment, during her tattoo removal. “There is no guarantee of perfect removal for any skin type, but it does become a little bit tougher on darker skin types,” explained Jordan Butler, founder of JHB Tattoo Removal, who has been treating Z, and sees clients with a range of complexions. “A lot of people that have come in and seen me in the past… have been told that they can’t have (a) tattoo removal, that it’s not possible. It’s definitely possible in most cases.” Though better laser technology in recent years has improved results and lessened unwanted outcomes such as hypopigmentation, Butler and Goergen emphasized that the outcome does depend on a technician’s knowledge and care. Ink pigment colors are targeted using different wavelengths, and some (like the one that targets warmer shades) are more “aggressive” than others, Goergen explained. “It’s possible to strip natural melanin out of the skin with the red or orange or yellow (inks),” he said. That’s why patch-testing is crucial, Butler said, which he did extensively with Z. Her first session was painful, she said, but the discomfort has lessened over time — “now it’s barely anything,” she commented — and her healing has been straightforward. “I think we’re almost there,” Z said of her progress. “It’s so much better than what it was.” Jayne Foo, a financial consultant based in Singapore, has experienced the more extreme side of recovery over the past few months as she’s embarked on the removal of around 70% of her tattoos, including one of her two full sleeves, a chest piece and a large stomach piece. And, for her 14,600 followers on , she’s documenting the entire laborious experience — open wounds, fluids and all. Redness, soreness and swelling are all common; but blistering can occur too, which Foo has experienced after both of her first two sessions. “I always knew I wanted to get tattoos, but as a young girl, I never had the money to get nice tattoos, so I just plastered anything I wanted on my body without thinking of how it would look in the future,” she told CNN in a phone call. On why she’s getting the tattoos removed now, she said: “I want a fresh start. I want to reclaim my skin.” That’s the message Foo also hopes to share with her social media followers as she embarks on the yearslong process. She’s not the first influencer to document it — and some have begun partnering with clinics to promote and show results. But videos on social media are often limited to the session itself, which can be deceptive due to “frosting,” which appears to immediately lighten the ink but is actually a temporary effect that occurs briefly (for about 15-20 minutes) when the laser hits the ink,before returning to normal. Foo’s videos show the hours and days following her treatments, during which she experienced large, intense blistering and extreme itching from the scabbing that followed, the latter for which she was eventually prescribed antihistamines. “The first time I had it done, my arm swelled up twice the size,” she recalled. “I wasn’t expecting that at all.” For the first few days of healing, she chose to remain indoors completely to minimize contact. “It’s just too much of a hassle to leave the house,” she said. “You have to be very mindful of your surroundings and you have to keep yourself clean.” Foo said she will continue to chronicle her treatments, as “it’s important to be real about it.” Accustomed to documenting many parts of her life online, including her fitness and travel, she also thought it would be “weird” to “suddenly not have tattoos” in her posts. Conversely, Gilyard has taken a more discreet route and has kept his removal process mostly private — including from his parents once again. Though, they eventually noticed his faded tattoos. “My dad finally looked at my tattoos one day and asked why they look like an old man’s,” Gilyard said. “My mother just asked me how much it cost, and asked me how much the tattoos themselves cost, and just said it was all a waste of money,” he laughed. “But I think she’s happy that some are going away.”",

    "content": "Twenty-five years ago, in his pristine but sparse Manhattan apartment, viewers got ready with Patrick Bateman for the first time, meeting the often suited and sometimes blood-drenched fictional character through his intensive morning routine. In the 2000 film adaptation of “American Psycho,” Christian Bale plays the yuppie investment banker — and nighttime serial killer, depending on your interpretation — who, upon waking, dons a cooling gel eye mask for his puffy eyelids while doing 1,000 crunches in his white briefs. He details his subsequent at length with added pointers. (Alcohol-based products are drying and “make you look older,” he offers). When his glistening herb-mint facial mask peels off, his real mask slips, revealing his unsettling stare. “There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me, only an entity, something illusory,” he monologues. “And though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there.” Throughout the film — and even more so in the book, published in 1991 by Bret Easton Ellis — Bateman is obsessive over brands and consumer goods, rattling off his knowledge and judging others on their tastes. Today, his specter lurks online through the hyper-consumerist attitudes on social media that almost makes his character’s obsessive behaviors seem normal. Influencers chronicle their minute-by-minute early morning fitness and wellness routines or multistep nighttime skincare regimen that appear to involve a never-ending array of products. The “ ,” popularized on TikTok, can involve peeling off or discarding multiple hydrating skincare masks, wrinkle patches, chin straps, mouth tape, LED masks, hair rollers and body wraps, all apparently worn overnight, to start the day. (Last year, Allure “the prison of being perpetually hot.”) “It’s a very relevant film for now, and of course, it was (released) way before social media,” said Jaap Kooijman, an associate professor in Media Studies and American Studies at the University of Amsterdam, who has written and taught on the book and film versions of “American Psycho,” in a phone interview. “But it’s based on the same principle of the outside appearance (and) consumer goods masking being empty inside.” The film may depict a serial killer, but it’s the display of the “ ” of the era — then limited to traditional media like print and TV ads — that has become a fascinating harbinger as consumers’ aspiration for products that align with self-worth has only seemed to grow. The film’s themes converge most directly in the “ ,” the increasingly persuasive corner of the internet pushing narrow and problematic views of masculinity. Bateman has often been held up as a cult symbol of the “ ,” an archetype for someone introverted and attractive who works hard, works out, has a good skincare routine, and also harbors contempt for women. Ellis’ original intentions with his novel have been continually debated, with many critics believing the book to be inherently misogynistic. But director Mary Harron’s take on Bateman, co-written with screenwriter Guinevere Turner, has been considered feminist by some, including Kooijman, in its critiques. “We’re still watching a serial killer, but it’s so over the top, and so well played by Christian Bale that it’s, you cannot take it fully seriously,” Kooijman explained. The same can be said of engagement-baiting online, where every trend is taken to extremes and context can be lost. Is it satire when a for dunking one’s face in iced sparkling water at 5 a.m. after pushups on the balcony? Or does it only become that when someone else responds with their version dipping their face into the bowl with each push-up? Bateman may have taken notes and ditched his gel mask. In any case, it’s all performance, something that “American Psycho” toes the line with as Bateman is increasingly revealed as an unreliable narrator. Bateman obsesses over the symbols of status — his business card typeface, the ever-elusive reservation at the notoriously exclusive restaurant Dorsia — but the reality of his day-to-day activities is unclear. His peers misidentify him, his outbursts to fiancé (played by Reese Witherspoon) and secretary (Chloë Sevigny) aren’t met with responses, and his chainsaw-wielding murders are cleaned up like they never happened at all. “His persona as a serial killer is just as real — or not real — as his persona as a consumer and his persona as a (banker),” Kooijman said. “They become interchangeable, and that’s the terror, or the dystopian factor of ‘American Psycho.’” Yet, while Ellis’ novel can be interpreted as a critique of the wealth and consumerism of New York in the ‘80s, a period of significant economic growth, it’s also presenting it, Kooijman said. “You could also read it as a celebration.” Because of that, Bateman’s purpose may have been lost on the fans who could benefit from the film’s point. After all, by the end he is a pathetic figure, confessing his most depraved actions only to be called the wrong name and ignored once again (not so much a hero of masculinity after all). Instead, many young men are circling around the same preoccupations that Bateman did,  “ ” to improve one’s jawline or skin but to an echo chamber of like-minded disaffected internet users, much like investment bankers showing off new business cards to one another to inflate their self-worth. The manosphere, after all, is intended for itself. “You can always be thinner, look better,” Bateman tells his secretary when he invites her over for the evening. Online, that message continues to resonate, as social media drives the insatiable hunger for . In “American Psycho,” Bateman’s identity is a hollow assemblage of labels, products and condescending monologues — a blueprint for the experience of being online today.

    "content": "With her wavy red hair scrunched up high in a ponytail, Chloe Humphries applies collagen patches by the Korean beauty brand Abib under her eyes before grooming her brows with an Anastasia Beverly Hills serum and layering her face with a multitude of skincare products: a peptide-infused essence by Sunday Riley, a vitamin C-infused sunscreen from Garnier and lip balm by Sol de Janeiro. It’s a process shared with her 634,000 followers on Instagram. “I’m going to be doing more runs than ever, so I need to make sure I’m taking care of my skin,” Humphries wrote in the video’s accompanying caption, adding that she will be running the London Marathon on April 27. “I’ve decided to treat each pre-run skincare routine like a warm-up and try to make sure I’m doing it every time,” she said. For Humphries, who has been running since 2020 and is based in the UK’s West Midlands, an effective beauty regime is increasingly as important as training ahead of a race. “When I do my makeup, it’s part of the ritual of getting ready, and having that time to myself (helps me to) decompress and distract from what’s coming up,” she told CNN in a phone call, recounting the pep talk she gives herself: “Get in the zone. You’ve got 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) or more to do. You’re going to be OK. Your makeup feels nice, and you’ll be running good when you’re out there.” Humphries is not alone in turning to grooming and beauty routines before a race to feel confident and prepared. London-based healthcare worker Intisar Abdul-Kader took up running in 2014 and has since participated in marathons globally (she completed the Tokyo Marathon in March and is now training for a half marathon in Amsterdam in May). Abdul-Kader emphasized the importance of skincare and makeup that ideally “will stay on for four hours.” (Her current go-to brands are Merit and Glossier.) “It’s about taking pride in showing up to a race that I’ve prepared for months,” Abdul-Kader told CNN by phone. “I’m not going to show up not looking my best. Feeling good, looking good — that’s outside as well as inside.” Charlotte Purdue, another UK-based runner, shared a similar sentiment: “It’s like going to work,” she said over a phone call. “You wouldn’t go to work without looking kind-of presentable. So, when you’re on the world stage — if you’re running a major marathon, you could be on TV — you just want to look good.” For some runners, beauty can extend beyond simple skincare to more elaborate treatments including tanning, manicures and intricate hairstyling. Sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson is known as not only one of history’s fastest women, but also for the ornately designed nails that has become a core part of her personal style. As she dashed across the track in the women’s 100-meter race at the 2024 Paris Olympics, her long custom acrylics — shipped to her from Brooklyn-based manicurist Angie Aguirre — were visible to all. Elite marathoner Anya Culling’s beauty regime takes place both before and after a run. The latter, which includes “an all-body moisturizer that feels like a massage, or a good hair mask, after my hair has been matted from a track session in the rain,” is vital because “it feels like self-care, which is important after I have pushed my body so hard,” she wrote to CNN over email. Investing in beauty prep — such as fake tan, eyebrow dying and gel manicures — ahead of time means that “I don’t have to do it every morning and can get straight up and train,” Culling explained. Among her favored products are the Bondi Sands one-hour express self-tanning foam, Eylure’s permanent eyebrow tint and BIAB nails. “I wouldn’t normally wear makeup for training, but for a race, the E.l.f. power grip primer and setting spray means my makeup doesn’t budge, and then a quick lick of Benefit’s BadGal Bang! mascara makes me feel exactly like the name suggests,” she added. The growing significance of beauty in sports marks a shift in athletes’ attitudes. Historically, athletes, particularly female ones, have focused primarily on their performance, with anything else viewed as a distraction, said Andrea Geurin, a professor of sports business at New York University’s Preston Robert Tisch Institute for Global Sport. This is, she explained, partly due to a largely male-dominated sports culture, where athletics is characterized by stereotypically masculine qualities, such as strength or competitiveness, resulting in female participation in sports being less appreciated. “Men’s sports have overshadowed women’s sports for so long that women athletes felt like they couldn’t focus on beauty, or on aspects of their femininity, while also being seen as a serious sportsperson,” she said on a call. American track and field athlete (known as Flo Jo) captured the public’s attention in the 1980s, not only for her running prowess while setting 100-meter and 200-meter world records at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, but also for her beauty regime, which included nails around four to six inches long, in bright colors or animal prints. Her fingernails were viewed as “both a source of intrigue and revulsion,” wrote Lynchburg College sport management professor Lindsay Pieper in . “Because she preferred long, colorful nails, the runner was depicted as abnormal, deviant, and different.” Joyner’s femininity — or perceived lack thereof — was often the source of controversy: Because of her deep voice and muscled physique, her career was mired by unproven allegations of performance-enhancing drug use. (She consistently passed drug tests during the 1988 games, including 11 tests that year, and an autopsy carried out after her death in 1998 found no conclusive proof of drug use.) Grappling with body image and stereotypes has long been a point of contention for Culling. “There was always this unspoken idea that if you were a girl who played sports, you either had to sacrifice your femininity or constantly prove that you could still be ‘girly’ enough off the field,” she said. “I remember feeling like I had to make an effort to dress a certain way or wear makeup just to remind people that I was still girly — even though I was just as passionate and competitive as any male counterpart.” I love the antithesis of being a girly girl who is also running faster than most guys out there. Elite marathon runner Anya Culling “As a young girl, this sent the message that strength and femininity can’t co-exist, which isn’t true at all,” Culling added. That sentiment, however, appears to be changing as Culling and a new generation of athletes become more comfortable with expressing their authentic selves. “Now, I embrace the fact that I can be competitive and athletic,” she said, adding that “I love the antithesis of being a girly girl who is also running faster than most guys out there.” “For so many years, it seemed like women weren’t allowed to fully express themselves. Now, we’re seeing this old notion turned on its head (as female athletes) take control and ownership of their image, and it’s actually empowering for them to talk about these other aspects of who they are beyond sports,” observed Geurin. “There’s no longer this contradiction; you can be strong and fast and also feminine.” Female participation in running competitions is growing: At the 2024 New York City Marathon, which is regarded as the largest in the world, 24,731 women completed the race — marking the highest number of female participants in its history. Women athletes are also increasingly visible thanks to the amplification of social media platforms, where people share their training journeys and race experiences. On TikTok, there has been a recent flood of videos with tags such as “ ” and “ .” For some amateur runners, the sport offers the potential for romance — leading some observers to dub run clubs as “ ” — which may explain a heightened interest in maintaining one’s appearance and looking good. “I know girls in my run club that have got run club crushes,” laughed Humphries. “Park runs and races are a really good way for people to meet. I think that for a long time, run clubs felt like something for the older generation, but with social media, younger people are (getting more involved).” What’s changed is that instead of going (running) on their own, people are coming together. FaceGym founder Inge Theron Humphries added that the sport has helped her form new friendships: “I have a friend group from my run club. We see each other outside of runs, and when we do go for runs, we message each other beforehand saying, ‘What are you going to wear? Will you have matching socks on today?’ I love that it’s become a way to meet people.” Rising interest in running has also proven attractive for brands. Last summer, beauty label Charlotte Tilbury partnered with Purdue, who counts over 51,500 followers on Instagram and 32,000 on TikTok, on video content showing off the products the runner uses in her routine. “They sent me loads of stuff, and I also got to go to their Covent Garden store (in London) and get a full glam look.” Purdue said. In 2024, Maybelline New York became the first-ever cosmetics sponsor of the New York City Marathon. Ahead of the upcoming London Marathon, companies including the self-tanning label Three Warriors and facial brand FaceGym have partnered with athletes and influencers, offering treatments that promote their products and services. “I think back to the London Marathon in the ‘80s and ‘90s, where people would run in their slops or casual clothes,” James Harknett, global creative artist at Three Warriors, told CNN over a call. “Now, the marathon is like a catwalk, where people are (considered about) what they’re choosing to wear and the skin they’re showing off.” Asked why he is now collaborating with runners, Harknett said he hoped to grow brand awareness and to “educate people and make them feel good in their skin.” A former avid runner herself, FaceGym founder Inge Theron started offering facial massages, as part of a quick break, to runners taking part in the Los Angeles Marathon about seven years ago. “The marathon (route goes) directly past Sunset Boulevard, where our shop is, and I saw a lot of people running and grinding (their teeth) from the stress,” she recalled. “It creates tension within their jaw.” Theron continued: “I’m seeing a lot more people get out and participate in (runs) — what’s changed is that instead of going on their own, people are coming together.” But whether people engage in athletics professionally or as a hobby, protective measures need to be taken, she warned. “It’s not just micro injuries that can be caused from the repeat repetition on the ground, but there’s also the sun and other things that can impact your skin and body,” she said.",

    "content": "From stopping dust and dirt getting into the eyes to prompting our blink reflex, eyelashes do more than just look pretty. Which makes it hard to explain the social media trend of men trimming down — or even entirely shaving off — their eyelashes in a bid to look “more masculine.” Videos posted to TikTok, Instagram and X in recent weeks show men braving blades very close to their eyes, in barber shops from to , in a quest for stubby lashes. While some barbers are seen wielding buzzing electric clippers, others are freestyling with just a pair of and, hopefully, a steady hand. “Eyelashes are vital for both visual experience and eye health,” said Vickie Lee, a consultant ophthalmic and oculoplastic surgeon at Imperial College London, in an email interview. “As well as acting as a barrier and a trigger for the protective blink reflex, eyelashes help reduce airflow over the eyes… maintaining moisture, keeping the eyes healthy and comfortable, filtering intense sunlight, reducing glare and improving visual quality.” While Lee said eyelashes follow a natural growth cycle, shedding and re-growing over time, she added that there are many reasons why removing them, per the methods seen on social media, is a bad idea. “Improper removal can lead to complications… Cutting or trimming eyelashes can cause discomfort and irritation as (it) can leave a sharp stubby end rubbing on the ocular surface,” she said, not to mention the risk of “causing potential injury to the eye.” Lustrous lashes have been a signifier of femininity or for centuries, depicted in art (including works by John Singer Sargeant and Pablo Picasso), poetry (Thomas Hood) and literature (F. Scott Fitzgerald), And there may be an evolutionary imperative, too: found that women with more attractive faces also possessed higher levels of the female sex hormone estrogen, which equates to increased fertility and fecundity — genetic traits that are appealing, in reproductive terms. But in today’s increasingly masculine political climate, fueled by controversial online “manosphere” figures such as Andrew Tate and tech bro jocks like Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg (who recently voiced his support for more “masculine energy” in the corporate world, telling podcaster in January: “A culture that celebrates the aggression a bit more has its own merits”), it is easy to see why some men are eager to repress anything about their appearance that could be construed as overtly feminine. Even Vice President JD Vance, an outspoken defender of men’s right to “masculine urges,” has fallen foul of new masculine beauty standards when it comes to his eyes. During his televised election debate in October 2024, the internet was that Vance had worn eyeliner to achieve his dark, heavy-lashed look. The chatter became so widespread that disgraced former Republican congressman weighed in: “Vance does NOT use eyeliner,” he wrote on X at the time. “I’ve met him in person before he was a senator and I can confirm he has long eyelashes and they cast a shadow on his waterline. Grow up people!” While none of the eyelash-shaving barbers approached for this story replied to CNN’s requests for comment, I do speak to one long-lashed male friend, 48-year-old, Spencer Bailey. “I’ve got a lot of flak over the years about my thick, dark eyelashes,” said the London-based IT professional. “But I definitely wouldn’t take the clippers to them. Comments are usually from other men who say they’re ‘girly’ — despite the fact I’m also 6-foot-2” — and ask if I’m wearing eye makeup or, more recently, if they’re fake… My wife likes them, but they seem to really bother some guys.” After decades of decline, gender traditionalism is on the rise among Republican voters in the United States, according to recent data cited by The New York TImes. In the (run by in conjunction with YouGov), which was carried out after President Donald Trump’s re-election in November 2024, Republicans increasingly endorsed what the survey called “traditional notions of masculinity,” with more than three quarters of Republican men and women agreeing with the view that “what it means to be a man has changed and I don’t think that has been good for society.” The same study found that 48% of Republican men agreed that women “should return to their traditional roles” in society — significantly up from May 2022, when the figure was 28%. The proportion of Republican women agreeing with the statement meanwhile increased from 23% to 37% in that time. While these opinions are just that (or, at least, there is little evidence that these thoughts have translated into real-world behavioral changes — than ever before and rates of marriage and are declining), it’s a stark reversal of the trends of the past half century, in which time the percentage of respondents in the saying that “women’s place is in the home” — from almost 30% in 1972 to 6% in 2008, when the survey’s researchers stopped asking the question. With women increasingly being perceived and treated as “less than” men, it is perhaps no surprise that some men are eager to avoid being perceived as “feminine.” I’ve got a lot of flak over the years about my thick, dark eyelashes. Comments are usually from other men who say they’re ‘girly’ — despite the fact I’m also 6-foot-2 Spencer Bailey “The more conservative, regressive or perhaps the more ‘traditional’ a society makes itself, the more it will really endeavor… to try to create two genders who look very different to each other,” Meredith Jones, honorary professor of gender studies at Brunel University of London, told CNN in a telephone interview. “Eyelashes are a strong binary,” Jones said. “There is currently a fashion for one sex to have eyelashes which are outrageously long, thick and black. These are seen as an indicator of high ‘uber’ femininity and… therefore, the opposite has to be ‘true’ for the opposite gender.” “The example of JD Vance being mocked for the appearance of wearing eye makeup during the election was fascinating,” Jones added. “Because President Trump obviously wears makeup, but his makeup endeavors to make him look more tanned, more toned, more chiseled… more ‘masculine.’” Meanwhile, and appear to be eschewing bold lashes in what has since been dubbed the movement. Could women also be moving away from the archetypally feminine big eyelash trend? While the ‘no mascara’ trend has been gaining traction, with a growing number of people showcasing their natural lashes as part of a broader shift towards minimalist beauty, mascara remains one of the most widely used cosmetic products, Clare Hennigan, principal analyst of beauty and personal care at research firm Mintel, told CNN. In fact, it remains the most commonly applied eye makeup in the US, she noted, indicating that “the no-mascara trend will take considerable time, if ever, to gain widespread adoption.” But trends are, indeed, cyclical. And for every action there is a reaction, pointed out Jones: “Fashions spring out of the times we are living in,” she said. “The 1960s were a classic example. One of the complaints of conservatives during that period was that they could no longer tell the difference between men and women due to the prevalence of bell-bottomed trousers and long hair worn by both sexes. In the ‘80s, in reaction to conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, London’s club fashion became very adventurous. These movements are always cyclical.”",

    "content": "It was still early in the morning when the crowd of sleepy students – all in matching uniforms and identical neat hairstyles – lined up for a daily gathering by the flagpole of their Bangkok high school. Eighth grader Baramee Chaovawanich was among the 3,600 students in attendance as teachers walked through each row, examining every teenager in a monthly spot check of their dress code compliance and appearances. Then, a teacher pointed at Chaovawanich, who goes by his nickname “Khao Klong” — indicating his hair was too long. Mortified, the boy was forced to step forward and have his head partially shaved in front of the whole school, with the teacher deliberately leaving the haircut unfinished for him to wear for the rest of the day. “There was a feeling of shame, like a child being singled out, made into a joke, isolated, and having their hair shaved, making them look ugly,” said Khao Klong, now 20 and at university. He still vividly remembers walking back into class afterwards, where “everyone turned to me and burst into laughter.” “It was a scene that remains stuck in my mind, and it made me really insecure,” he said. The punishment may seem extreme, but for decades, these scenes were common across , with students subject to strict rules about their appearances that go far beyond the school dress codes seen in other countries. For instance, male students had to have an army-style crew cut and female students had to wear their hair in short, ear-length bobs — before rules were loosened in 2013 (when boys could grow their hair to the base of their neck, and girls could grow their hair even longer, so long as it was tied up). Khao Klong’s hair had only been a few centimeters over the limit, but even that was too much to allow. But rules on hairstyles are changing in a significant way. In March, the country’s highest administrative court annulled the directive – set by the Ministry of Education in 1975 – declaring it unconstitutional. The rules “imposed excessive restrictions on personal freedom,” thus violating the Thai Constitution, read the court order. It added that the 50-year-old regulations “did not align with contemporary social conditions” and harmed children’s mental health during developmentally significant ages, and especially those with diverse gender identities. The court ruling has been a long time coming, after nationwide student protests in 2020 pushed the issue to the fore and prompted the education ministry to leave it to schools to decide their own rules. The decision was met with delight by some students, who have long wanted to express themselves freely in their appearance. “Things have changed, especially (regarding how) they checked hairstyles,” said 16-year-old Nijchaya Kraisriwattana in April. Her school in Bangkok used to hold weekly checks to examine students’ appearances, and she’d previously had academic points deducted for her hair being too long. The rules were so strict she even had to pin back her bangs and tuck away stray baby hairs curling around her face – but these days, the rules seem “more relaxed,” she said. But concerns linger among others who fear some schools will continue to impose strict guidelines and harsh punishments without government intervention. “At first, I was happy when I read about it, but then people started analyzing it. It seems like there are still gaps, which makes me a bit worried because it doesn’t seem very different from before,” Khao Klong said. He and other student activists “haven’t seen much change happening,” he added. CNN has reached out to the Ministry of Education for comment. Though it can be hard to fathom why the rules were so rigid, they reflect Thailand’s conservative, hierarchical Buddhist society — and a culture born from many years of authoritarian rule. The powerful military’s influence runs deep in Thailand, a constitutional monarchy that has seen a dozen successful coups since 1932 — the most recent in 2014. The student dress code regulations were drafted by a military government under the decade-long dictatorship of Thanom Kittikachorn, who was ousted by a violent uprising in 1973. But the military’s conservative influence on how students are told to show up to school has persisted until today, said Thunhavich Thitiratsakul, an educational policy researcher at the Thailand Development Research Institute who has previously written about the dress code policy. “It’s a social norm, the social value is that students have to abide by the law, and if they behave well, they become a good person,” he said. In Thailand, “students have to listen to their parents and follow the school regulations,” he added. “If (they) get a job in the future and can follow by the rules … it means like, OK, you’re a good person, and you tend to do well.” The March court order acknowledged this line of thinking, pointing out that the hairstyle regulations had “aimed to cultivate students as future responsible citizens, emphasizing the need for close supervision by parents and teachers to ensure they adhered to societal norms and laws.” This military-style education extended to other forms of discipline, too. Khao Klong recalled teachers beating him almost “every day” in middle school for “lacking discipline,” sometimes using a ruler until it broke. The rules are strict about uniforms too, which are similar across all public schools – even specifying the types of socks and shoes students must wear. As times changed, students began pushing back. But even a relaxation of rules in 2013 stoked controversy — with some parents and teachers arguing that looser regulations would encourage disobedience and distraction. That debate continued until protests broke out across the country in 2020, with a band of students deciding they had had enough. That year was a monumental one. Across the nation, tens of thousands of pro-democracy protesters took to the streets, demanding reforms to the military-drafted constitution and powerful monarchy. The protests were remarkable because they challenged long-standing taboos against criticizing the royal family — which under Thai laws is punishable by jail time. As the demonstrations stretched across the summer and fall, students took action too. Middle and high school students vowed to overhaul the dress code and hairstyle regulations, and to reform what they called the abuse of power by teachers and administrators. The two movements were separate, but the students’ protests may have been influenced by the larger pro-democracy demonstrations, said Thunhavich, the researcher. Photos from student protests showed hundreds of teenagers adopting many of the visual cues used in the pro-democracy demonstrations, like the three-finger salute and yellow rubber ducks. “Our first dictatorship is school,” read one popular slogan written on protest signs. Khao Klong was one of those students. His head-shaving experience had left a “mental scar” that he didn’t want anyone else to endure, he said — so he joined a coalition of activists called Bad Students. “Cast off the bitter, outdated uniforms!” read one post by Bad Students in November 2020, urging students to “dress as you please.” The following month, the group organized a protest in front of the Ministry of Education, where students hung their school uniforms on the gates. The protests were colorful, lively affairs — with students kitted out appropriately. Some put black masking tape over their mouths to represent their feelings of oppression at school; others came in inflatable dinosaur costumes, poking fun at what they called the older, outdated generation of Thai politicians dictating their uniforms. In a show of defiance, some even cut their hair at the protests. One 19-year-old, Pimchanok Nongnual, shaved her hair on the steps of the education ministry and in front of a top official, at the time. “What about gender fluid or non-binary students?” she said — echoing many students who showed up in rainbow clothing to demand more gender-diverse uniforms. “We felt hopeless. At that moment, it was like, if not us, then who? In the sense that if we don’t speak up, who will speak for us?” Khao Klong said. The group filed petitions and complaints with the government — which eventually led to the education ministry repealing its hairstyle regulations in 2023 to ensure they “do not limit students’ bodily freedom.” Last year, the ministry also told schools and teachers to use caution when doling out punishments. The recent court order appears to, at least on paper, cement these victories — and by declaring the hairstyle rules “unconstitutional,” could give students more leverage at schools that choose to maintain stricter rules. Nijchaya, the student in Bangkok, felt the change when she arrived at school recently without her bangs pinned back. “They just let it pass without saying anything,” she said. When asked whether she wanted more freedom in her clothing, she emphatically answered, “Yes, absolutely,” and said she’d like to wear T-shirts and jeans, and let her hair down loose. But Thunhavich said it’s too soon to celebrate. Schools now need to be held accountable and consult with their communities and school boards on how to adjust their regulations, he said. But it’s not clear if students will have a seat at the table. Five years after the protests swept Thailand, the students once on the front lines are also tired. Many have moved on with their educations, juggling the demands of schoolwork, jobs and daily life. The issue of student rights has faded from headlines, though obstacles linger. Still, Khao Klong said, “with this court order, I hope we can return to discussing rights and freedoms in every school, issues of oppression or authoritarianism.” “Just because we haven’t talked about it doesn’t mean it has disappeared; we’ve just forgotten to address it,” he added. “We feel that the desire to fight may have diminished, but everyone still remembers the feeling of being threatened when we stood up to fight for our own rights.”",

    "content": "A perfectly twirled bite of spaghetti hangs off a fork mid-air. Next to it, a bowl of and a katsudon — freshly cooked eggs and pork cutlet – fall fresh out of the pan. Plates are stacked high with colorful sashimi and elaborate parfaits. It’s a feast for the eyes — and the eyes alone. These are “shokuhin sampuru” — the highly realistic food replicas commonly displayed in front of restaurants in Japan, intended to lure customers inside. A familiar sight in Japan, a vast array of these replicas are now on display in London in an exhibition that is the first of its kind, according to Simon Wright, the show’s curator and director of programming at “ !” features replicas made by the Iwasaki Group, the first company dedicated to the production of these fake foods which remains today the largest producer in Japan. (The company needs to make on average one replica every 40 minutes in order to keep the business viable, according to Wright.) Its founder, Takizo Iwasaki, was to create wax models of food from a childhood memory of seeing candlewax fall into a puddle and form into the shape of a flower. A version of Iwasaki’s first ever replica — modeled after an omelette his wife made — is on display at the exhibition, named “kinen omu,” or celebration omelette. Over time, Iwasaki developed a production method using wax and agar jelly molds, though now the company mainly uses PVC. However the origin story of food replicas more broadly is a “mess,” according to Nathan Hopson, a professor of Japanese at the University of Bergen who has studied the subject in-depth. Hopson told CNN in a video call that there are a myriad of theories as to how the replicas came to be introduced in Japanese culture. One popular explanation, , is that they were made to familiarize Western dishes to a “curious yet cautious” Japanese public who otherwise wouldn’t know what to expect if they made an order. Among the swaths of traditional Japanese food, the exhibit also features strikingly realistic renderings of bacon, eggs and grilled cheese. The exhibition’s centerpiece is a map of Japan made up of food replicas representing each of the country’s 47 prefectures. Each replica was specially commissioned and made by the Iwasaki Group, which created replicas of some dishes for the very first time. It wasn’t easy to choose just one dish per prefecture for Wright’s team, who started by consulting a list created by Japan’s Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, before also reaching out to people from the regions. “You start to discover that a lot of people have a lot of opinions on this,” Wright said. An exception was made for the northernmost prefecture of Hokkaido, the only one represented by two dishes: “kaisen-don,” a bowl of rice topped with seafood, and “ohaw,” a soup from the indigenous Ainu community. The Iwasaki Group had never made a replica of ohaw before, so the exhibition’s team had to ask the community to make them the dish, which was sent to Osaka overnight, photographed, and made into a replica the next day. Creating the impression of realistic liquids is one of the most difficult techniques to master in replica-making. Done right, the result is bowls of soup and glasses of wine which give the sense that they would spill over the table if mishandled by a curious visitor. There is a ‘hyper-realism’ to these foods, explained Wright, which is intended to trigger the prospective customer’s memory, imagination — and hopefully catch their eye. “They are there to attract people in an instant,” he said. “To try and lure them to have lunch or to have dinner there.” And importantly, people trust that the food they see on display will live up to the food they get in real life, with Hopson calling them a “promise.” “I can go into any place in Japan, in any town and city and know exactly what I’m going to get,” he said. But the replicas are more than marketing made pleasing to the eye. They serve a practical function, dating back to when they were introduced by Shirokiya, a major department store, in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake on Japan’s main island in 1923. The store was one of the first places to open in Tokyo after the earthquake and serviced the masses of people who could no longer cook for themselves at home, explained Hopson, who studied the company’s history. Rather than decide their order when they reached the store’s top-floor cafeteria, a new system was designed: window displays could give customers the opportunity to look at the food on offer while they waited in line. “It’s really about this management side, supply-side rationalization that’s very much part of creating a new, modern, capitalist success story,” said Hopson, who added that they really took off in the 1970s, or Japan’s ‘year-zero’ for fast food. Though they continue to be a common sight in Japan’s restaurant windows, the replicas are also evolving in their function. The exhibition shows how food replicas can be used for quality control in agriculture, food manufacturing and for nutritional purposes by displaying the ideal diet for a person with diabetes. The exhibition also gives visitors a chance to arrange their own bento box with the replica treats. Who said you shouldn’t play with your food?",

    "content": "Since crowds first began gathering in Times Square to commemorate New Year’s Eve over a century ago, it has been a ritual to flock to midtown’s brightly lit chaos to ring in new beginnings. At 11:59 p.m. a dazzling ball descends down a pole, while attendees — and millions of people tuning in from home — count down from 60. At the stroke of midnight, the crowd erupts into a cacophony of sound, often pulling their loved one in for a ceremonial kiss. But how did this New Year’s Eve celebration start, and why do we commemorate the occasion by watching a ball descend down a pole? The Times Square ball first dropped in 1904, and it came into being thanks to Jacob Starr, a Ukranian immigrant and metalworker, and the former New York Times publisher, Adolph Ochs. The latter had successfully drawn crowds to the newspaper’s skyscraper home in Times Square with pyrotechnics and fireworks to celebrate the forthcoming year, but city officials banned explosives from being used after just a few years of the festivities. So Ochs commissioned Starr, who worked for sign-making firm Strauss Signs (later known as Artkraft Strauss, a company at which Starr served as president), to create a new visual display. Over the past century, that display, and symbol of the New Year has evolved from a iron and wood cage adorned with light bulbs to a dazzling technicolor crystal sphere. Their concept was based on time balls, nautical devices that had gained popularity in the 19th century. As time-telling became more precise, ship navigators needed a standardized way to set their chronometers. Each day, harbors and observatories would raise and lower a metal ball at the same time to allow sailors to synchronize their instruments. Both Ochs and the New York Times’ chief electrician, Walter Palmer, have been credited with the idea, allegedly inspired by the downtown Western Union Building, which dropped a time ball each day at noon. But Starr’s granddaughter Tama, who joined Artkraft Strauss in 1982 and now owns the business, said in a phone interview that she believes it was her grandfather who came up with the concept of the ball being lowered and lit up with the new year numerals at midnight. “The idea was to … have it illuminated with the brand-new electricity that had just come up to the neighborhood,” said Tama, who for many years served as foreperson at the Times Square ball drop. “And it was lowered by hand … starting at one minute to midnight, and that was the way it was done for many years.” “It was an adaptation of an old, useful thing,” she added. “It was instantly popular. People just loved it.” Though Manhattan had been partially illuminated by electricity since the early 1880s, the US National Park Service (NPS) that half of American homes were still lit by gas lights and candles until the 1920s. The sight of a glimmering ball lowering down from the dark skies would have seemed otherworldly. When the ball reached the parapet with a sign displaying the numbers of the year, “the electrician would throw the switch, turning off the ball and turning on the numbers at the same time,” Tama said. “So it looked like the ball coming down transformed into the set of numbers.” All of Times Square got in on the theatrics. In the first year, waiters in nearby restaurants and hotels wore battery-powered “1908” top hats that they illuminated at the stroke of midnight. “It looked like magic to people,” said Tama. There have been seven different Times Square balls since that first descent, from a 700-pound iron structure fitted with 25-watt light bulbs, to a lighter aluminum frame after World War II, to a “Big Apple” during the administration of the city’s former mayor Ed Koch. In 1995, when the ball got a glitzy update with rhinestones, strobe lights and computer controls, traditional signmakers were no longer needed — which meant that Artkraft Strauss, the company that had brought the ball to Times Square, was no longer needed either. Today’s ball is a collaboration between Waterford Crystal and Philips Lighting, using 32,256 LEDs that can be programed to display millions of colors and patterns on its surface. Nonetheless, Tama remembers her years as the timekeeper on the roof of One Times Square fondly. When the last minute of the year arrived, workers lowered the ball down using a complex pulley system. In performing this ritual year after year, Tama sees an intrinsic link between the countdown, which she calls “a minute outside of time,” and the making of New Year’s resolutions. “When you’re concentrating really hard, time seems to slow down,” she said. “It felt like the longest minute in the world. It felt like you had time to wash your hair, call your mother, change your life. You really can change your life in one minute — you can decide to be different. You can decide to be kinder and better.” A version of this article first published in 2021.",

    "content": "For most of us, the chances of having Martha Stewart visit our garden is vanishingly small. Until now. After years of research, a highly fragrant pink and apricot hybrid tea rose named after the lifestyle doyenne has hit the market. In May 2023 Stewart decided to install a rose garden at her Bedford, New York estate and invited Danielle Dall’Armi Hahn, the owner of and author of “The Color of Roses,” to advise her. While Hahn was in New York for the garden build, the two began to discuss an idea over dinner. “I said, ‘Martha, what do you think about having your own rose?’. And she said, ‘Amazing, I would love that’,” explained Hahn. Creating a new rose is a massive undertaking — from inception to market usually takes years. So, while Stewart’s involvement in the project began a few years ago, the rose named after her has been around a decade in the making. The creation of a rose begins by considering “the traits you want” the flower to have, explained Consulting Rosarian (a certified expert in rose care) and independent hybridizer Christopher Huffer, before choosing your parent plants with those traits. Once the parents are crossed through the pollination process, seeds will form in rose hips (the seed pods of roses) with each seed having the potential to become a new rose. Then there are years of testing before a potential new rose can ever be sold commercially. Hahn is no stranger to working with celebrities. She and her father Lorenzo Dall’Armi collaborated with chef and author Julia Child when Child decided to pick the now iconic yellow rose to be her namesake. Stewart, meanwhile, already has a number of plants carrying her name including a begonia, a daffodil and an orchid. But to have a rose named after you is “a really big honor,” said Hahn. “And for people who love roses, it is the highest honor”. Finding the perfect rose to become Martha’s namesake was difficult according to Hahn, who visited various fields and looked at dozens of contenders. When searching for the right rose, there are a number of factors to consider, including color. Stewart has a “very defined color palette,” said Hahn, “but anything in like the medium-pink to peach, to apricot, even a creamy apricot, I think she would have been open to.” But the search ended when they came across a compact hybrid tea in Martha’s preferred color palette at ,   an American horticultural company involved in plant breeding, distribution and intellectual property. What would become the Martha Stewart rose was first sent to the United States as a test rose called CP 15 8603   in December 2015, one of many sent by European rose breeding company Meilland International for evaluation. “On average, it’s maybe 150 codes (roses) we get from them every year,” Kristen Smith, a rose evaluation manager   for Star Roses and Plants, told CNN. But Meilland is just one of the rose breeders the company works with. On average, it looks at close to 700 roses annually, according to Smith. After entering the US, roses are placed in a two-year quarantine period before testing begins. During the testing phase roses are reviewed for certain  criteria, including growth and development in different weather conditions, as well as disease resistance.  The rose that would become Stewart’s was placed at Star Roses’ testing fields in Pennsylvania and California. In 2021, as it became apparent that CP 15 8603 was special, the Star Roses team decided to patent it. “At that time, we hadn’t necessarily 100% decided to introduce it, but we knew that it was an important variety,” said Susan Bacus Morgan, marketing manager for Star Roses and Plants. “On average, it’s about five varieties that are going in  to the catalog every year,” said Smith, meaning that on average   less than 1% of the roses tested make it into Star’s portfolio annually. “It’s a really long and loving process to launch a rose,” said Morgan. “We want to release the very best.” While many people had a hand in finding the perfect rose to carry Stewart’s name, it was ultimately Martha’s choice. “Martha personally chose and approved the rose,” confirmed a spokesperson from a public relations agency that represents Stewart, in an email to CNN. “I am so happy that such a great rose is named after me and that many of you will be adding it to your garden!”, said Stewart in an Instagram post on her verified account last week. Stewart also thanked Hahn who “worked with me for two years to make this happen”. While new to the North American market, this same rose has been available since 2021 in Europe, where it is known as “ .” “Oftentimes a rose introduced in Europe will receive a different name in America,” said Morgan. When choosing a name for commercial use, cultivators pick “something to catch people’s attention,” said Beth Smiley, publications director of the American Rose Society. “The Martha Stewart rose is going to attract a lot of attention”. There is no “financial benefit for having a rose named after you — absolutely zero,” said Hahn. In a statement provided to CNN, Star Roses said: “This rose has been named in honor of Martha Stewart, recognizing her extraordinary contributions to lifestyle, design, homemaking, and gardening… Our hope is that this rose will honor her legacy and serve as a source of inspiration for generations to come.” While there are only a limited number of plants are available for , if you miss out this year, the variety is expected to be available at independent garden centers in 2026. As a repeat bloomer, you can expect the Martha Stewart rose  to flower in flushes through the growing season. Smith said that while the rose has performed well in hot, dry climates like California, “it does get some leaf spot in areas that are more susceptible to fungal diseases, but it is better than older varieties of hybrid tea types.” But it’s the scent that’s the standout for this plant. “It’s not a traditional rose fragrance,” said Hahn. “It’s fruitier, it’s light, it’s luscious. You feel like you could eat it.” The article was updated to attribute a quote to a Martha Stewart spokesperson.",

    "content": "Yrjö Kukkapuro, a renowned Finnish designer whose postmodern style of chairs graced waiting rooms, offices and living rooms across Finland as well as collections in the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, has died. He was 91. His death Saturday at his home outside was confirmed by his daughter, Isa Kukkapuro-Enbom, in an email to The Associated Press on Sunday, as well as a from Studio Kukkapuro, where she is the curator. The cause of death was not disclosed. “Almost every Finn has sat on a chair he designed — at a metro station, in a bank, at school, or in a library,” the studio said in a news release. “Yrjö Kukkapuro never stopped designing and coming up with new ideas. Until the very end, he pondered a concept of his new chair, the plan of which was clear in his mind. His assistant didn’t have time to make drawings of the chair.” In a career spanning more than 70 years, Kukkapuro’s chairs were lauded for their comfort, functionalism and ergonomics as well as their design, and featured names like Ateljee, Karuselli-chair, Long Chair and, his most famous, the Experiment. Designed in 1982, the Experiment chair was considered avant-guarde but ultimately became commercially successful and was seen as a key turning point for the postmodern style of furniture. The Experiment includes decorative, wavy armrests in bright colors, an upholstered back and bottom, and its signature angled seat despite the frame being flat on the ground. Although initial production ceased in the 1990s, European furniture design brand Hem sought permission from Kukkapuro in 2021 to reproduce it with minor adjustments to the scale and construction. “We are saddened by the news of Yrjö’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family,” Hem founder and chief executive Petrus Palmér said in an email to AP. “He was a furniture design trailblazer, and showed us that a non-conformist approach is the only way to achieve a lasting legacy.” The Experiment chair retailed for up to 2,399 euros ($2,479) on Hem’s website Sunday, where a description called it “timeless, bold, and as compelling today as the day it was created.” “In the Experiment Chair, Kukkapuro sought to add art to Functionalism, to satisfy romantic tastes alongside meeting essential needs,” the description reads. “The result is startling, authentic, a hero of twentieth-century design.” Kukkapuro designed his family’s studio and home to feature a wave-shaped roof and floor-to-ceiling glass windows. Built in the late 1960s for him and his wife, artist Irmeli Kukkapuro, who died in 2022, it’s scheduled to become a museum next year.",

    "content": "In the year 2000, HBO advertised Ellen DeGeneres’ latest comedy special with a Botticelli reference. Perched inside a clam shell and surrounded by figures from the original painting, DeGeneres created her own “Birth of Venus” for the promotional print poster — subbing out nudity for a more signature white pantsuit. (Both HBO and CNN share the parent company Warner Bros. Discovery). Three years late for a magazine advertisement, the now-defunct Toyota sub-brand, Scion, decided to reproduce Damien Hirst’s controversial sculpture “The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living” (1991) by suspending their XII model in a tank of seafoam green formaldehyde. In the same decade, there was a surprisingly artistic print artwork for the season of the popular 2005 CBS TV show “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation”. In the ad, cast members gaze through the window of a neon-lit diner lifted straight out of American painter Edward Hopper’s seminal painting “Nighthawks” (1942). Each of the campaigns may appear to have little in common, but they reveal an unmistakable truth about the advertising industry: before digital marketing became the norm, overtaking print in terms of revenue and budget allocation, there was arguably more room for complex, creative and daring image-making. Jim Heimann, graphic designer, historian and the editor of the forthcoming book “All-American Ads of the 2000s” — available in the UK from April 14 and in the US a month later — is worried these might be the last of their kind. “Print is slowly disappearing. That’s a problem,” he said. Like a skilled archaeologist, Heimann has spent his life hunting down and preserving American cultural relics, such as cocktail napkins collected while researching the country’s penchant for drive-in restaurants to travel brochures from the early 20th century. A fixture at Sunday flea markets for the last 50 years, Heimann finds they are a good location to scour for magazines — often the first thing to go following a home clearout, he said. He normally turns to eBay to source specific ads, despite the added cost, and takes care to cherry pick from across pop culture, selecting the most artfully designed campaigns  for top movies, popular games and even beloved cereal brands, among others. With each decision, he’s thinking:  “What would I want to revisit 20 years from now?” In 2000, Heimann was commissioned by Taschen to create a series of books that mapped the visual fluctuations of the advertising industry. He started with the 1950s, a post-war period often referred to as the golden age of capitalism in the US, sourcing John Wayne-fronted Camel ads, glossy Cadillac double-page spreads and kitschy lingerie illustrations. Then he went back to the ‘30s, the ‘40s and jumped forward to the ‘60s, following each decade until the last tome cataloging the Wild West of the ‘90s hit the shelves in 2022. This edition on the aughts, however, will likely conclude the collection. “We had a discussion about doing 2010 to 2020,” Heimann told CNN in a video call. “But the material just isn’t there anymore.” Chronicling the earlier part of the decade has proved difficult. As the book’s foreword by Steven Heller, former senior art director of the New York Times, reads: “Advertising did not change when the Times Square ball fell at the stroke of midnight on January 1, 2000, but the industry began its creative decline in the 2000s” — a period when digital advertising was starting to creep in. When Google launched its AdWords platform in 2000, small businesses could eschew forking out for expensive visual campaigns and instead promote themselves on Google’s search results page with text-based adverts. By 2001, television had surpassed newspapers in terms of ad revenue for the first time in the US. These developments mark “the end of a century of advertising,” said Heimann. For Heimann, ads offer insight into the values and aspirations as well as political and economic environments of a generation. On compiling them in the book, he explained: “We always have a staple of 10 categories, but we expand them according to the decades. For instance, in the 1940s we had to expand war-related ads. They were really predominant, all these companies that were no longer producing automobiles or tires were doing everything for the war effort.” In the aughts, many of the ads were focused on technology. “The tech world just blew up,” Heimann said. “Everything fell into that (category) consistently.” It was the 10-year-period that saw the invention of the first ever iPhone, the iMac, the iBook, the MacBook, the iPad, the iPod, iPod Nano and iPod Mini — and that’s just Apple. Heimann also found old Motorola, Blackberry, Sony and Nokia ads, along with a slew of brands that are no longer in existence. Amid a shift in societal attitudes towards sexuality and sexual freedom, the concept of “sex sells” became a common marketing strategy in the ‘70s — so much so that it would be difficult to tell the difference between a Dolce & Gabbana campaign and an ad for Durex, said Heimann. Sexual marketing imagery continues to be prevalent, despite advertising’s changing tides (see in 2024, which Heimann sought to collect but failed to find a print copy, even after searching through 15 men’s magazines at his local newsstand). In a Gucci ad from 2002, a topless male model is photographed side-on, undoing the monogrammed belt of his ‘G’ embroidered jeans — the leather strap in-hand creating a “sophomoric suggestion of an enhanced male appendage,” wrote Heller in the book. A Tom Ford menswear shoot Heimann preserved from 2008 shows an entirely naked female model grabbing the crotch of a suited man. “Females are always exploited,” he pointed out. “But to the extent of how they exploit women just becomes (implausible).” At least the French brand Sisley somewhat evened the score, with an advert of a nude man saddled up and being ridden by a fully clothed woman. Still, to Heimann, this level of sexualization is “toned down” compared to the material he has collected from the ‘80s and ‘90s. “Now, we’ve got this new era of hyper masculinity,” Heimann said, referring to Trump’s hypermasculine campaign messaging that called for a return of gender roles, as well as the rise of “manosphere” influencers such as Andrew Tate and Joe Rogan, who push male-supremacist viewpoints and call for the subservience of women on platforms such as YouTube. “Where’s that going to take us?” he questioned. Between the leaps in AI technology and the new US administration, Heimann has questions not only on what adverts in the future might look like, but also who might be making them in the first place. It’s unlikely advertisers will want to spend on an agency to deliver a campaign when they can create them using AI for a fraction of the price. A conducted by the University of Oxford suggests that AI-generated advertising images performed more effectively than human-made ones, as long as the images used do not look like artificial intelligence. “Where will that creative world go?” Heimann mused. “It’ll have to play out, but it doesn’t bode well.” A fixation on cutting costs might only become greater in light of President Donald Trump’s anti-European initiatives and the recently announced 25% tariffs on imported cars among other products. “How do you sell a car that’s 25% more (expensive) than another car?” Heimann asked. “Who’s going to buy a Subaru (or) a Volvo (if they) charge 25% more than an American car?” For Heimann, advertisements of the last two decades have been selling a steady version of the American Dream. “In the ‘90s and the early 2000s, advertising still has that same cadence to it. The population looks the same, the automobiles look the same,” he said. Now, Heimann thinks that as America continues to evolve, more monumental changes will come in the years ahead. “I’ve been asked the question, ‘Did 9/11 affect advertising and how people perceived it?’ I think there was a little bump (in the road)… But I think what’s happening currently is going to be much more impactful,” he said.

    "content": "People across Asia flocked to shopping malls and online stores Friday as they scrambled to get their hands on the latest edition of Labubu, a collectible toy that has sparked buying frenzies the world over. Inspired by Nordic folklore, the toothy, fluffy figurines — which typically come in palm-sized “blind boxes” — drew crowds in cities from Bangkok, to Kuala Lumpur as the new collection went on sale. They were also made available online, where they quickly sold out. The brainchild of Hong Kong-born, Netherlands-raised illustrator Kasing Lung, Labubu and fellow creatures from his “The Monsters” series have amassed a loyal following since their founding in 2015. But Labubu’s popularity has spiked over the past year, thanks to celebrity endorsements. Lisa, from K-pop mega group Blackpink, has frequently professed her love of the creature on social media. “Labubu is my baby,” she in a recent Teen Vogue video. Titled “Big Into Energy,” the latest drop features six vinyl plush pendants (and one “secret” figurine) representing “emotions” like love, hope and happiness — each made in new colorways. The new Labubus cost between $13 and $16 each in various Asian countries. Shortly after their release on Friday, some pendants were being resold for up to $90 on US online resell platform StockX. At the CentralWorld shopping mall in Bangkok, dozens of fans lined up before its branch of Pop Mart — Labubu’s licensed distributor — had even opened, despite having pre-registered time slots. University student Kamolwan Pohfah, 21, said she left home early to reach the store because she couldn’t wait to get her hands on the newest collection.  “I have been following Labubu for almost two years now,” she told CNN. “It was kind of ugly at first sight. But I kept seeing it on social media. And my friends are crazy about it, so I follow them,” she said. Tourist Emily Jong, 27, who was also in line and visiting from Australia, said she tried her luck at the mall hours before she was due to fly home, but left empty-handed. “We tried to line up but we didn’t know we have to register,” she said. Hathairus Mekborisut, 53, bought a box set of six pendants. She decided to keep one, named “luck,” for herself and to resell the rest. She’s been “longing” for a purple one, she said. Another reseller who goes by her nickname Mai, and wanted to remain anonymous, led a small group to buy up as many as possible. She said she could make double the retail price by reselling them to customers in other countries. Despite recently shooting to global fame, Labubu (who is a girl) has been a decade in the making. She first appeared as a side character, often hiding in the background, in a fairy world created by Lung in his three-part picture book series, “The Monsters,” according to Pop Mart, the Chinese toy company licensed to sell Labubu merchandise. Boasting rabbit-like ears, big round eyes and a mischievous grin, Labubu is “kind-hearted and always wants to help, but often accidentally achieves the opposite,” the company said on its website. Lung, 52, previously told Hong Kong local newspaper Ming Pao that the character was inspired by his childhood, which was filled with Nordic folk tales of elves, trolls and fairies. After moving to the Netherlands as a child, he picked up Dutch through simple picture books. Fans often accessorize their outfits by clipping Labubu plushies onto their clothes or bags (they were even spotted at Paris Fashion Week last month). The figurines are also taken to fan-led meet-ups or posted on online marketplaces, where they are traded and resold. Pop Mart, a Chinese toymaker that has made its mark in a collectibles market traditionally dominated by Japan, has found success in selling Labubus in a blind-box format — which makes contents a mystery until opened, adding to their appeal. “The Monsters” series is its best-selling franchise, and last year generated 3 billion yuan ($410 million) in sales. Videos of young fans anxiously unboxing the figurines, and erupting into joy — or sometimes disappointment — have flooded social media platforms like TikTok. And celebrities like Rihanna and Blackpink’s Rosé have only added to the hype. On Wednesday, Blackpink’s Lisa showed off her new pink and yellow tie-dye furry Labubu, from the latest release, in an Instagram story. She revealed herself as a fan about a year ago, when a photo of the star hugging a large Labubu in a camping costume went viral. Her endorsement is widely credited with fueling the toy’s popularity, particularly in Southeast Asia, which is Pop Mart’s largest — and fastest growing — overseas market. Last year, the Chinese toymaker’s annual revenues in the region grew by 619% to over 2.4 billion yuan ($309 million). A fan base is also growing in the US, though American buyers will have to pay more for their purchases amid a trade war between China and the US, which has hit most Chinese imports with a 145% tariff. (China retaliated with a 125% tariff.) A blind box from the latest series, which also went on sale in the US on Friday, is priced at $27.99, up from $21.99 for the previous series. Among the new Labubus being released is a rare one labeled “Secret,” which buyers have just a 1-in-72- chance of unboxing. “It’s quite fun. If you do get the secret ones, you do get the dopamine,” said 27-year-old collector Lawrence Yu, who lives in Melbourne, Australia and has so far spent $1,200 Australian dollars ($763) on over two dozen Labubus, ranging from ones found in “blind boxes” to plush toys. He recalled arriving ahead of a drop at a local mall, where a new Pop Mart store had opened last October, at 2:30 a.m, before spending 10 hours in line. “I hope it comes to Melbourne soon,” he said in a video call, referring to the new series, which will not be released in physical stores in Australia until the end of this month.",

    "content": "Six years after their original outing, actors Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick are back for “Another Simple Favor.” This time, a destination wedding on a sun-drenched Italian island is the backdrop to intrigue, murderous intent, and floppy hats the size of small parachutes. The sequel to 2018’s dark comedy “A Simple Favor” sees the cunning Emily (Lively) reunite with frenemy Stephanie (Kendrick) after the former’s early release from prison for double murder. The simple favor in question this time? “Will you be my maid of honor?” Emily asks — a surprising turn as Stephanie played a key role in the arrest and conviction of Emily years prior. Nonetheless, the two jet off to Capri, Italy, for the lavish wedding of Emily and the very suave and wealthy Dante (played Michele Morrone) where betrayal, snappy dialogue and vintage mob boss-inspired suits   await them. Fans of Emily and Stephanie’s wardrobe in 2018 can look forward to more bold, opulent statement pieces and elevated looks, according to the film’s costume designer Renee Ehrlich Kalfus. “I’d say the whole of the picture was to attain more of a grand and over the top style,” Kalfus told CNN over email. “The costumes altogether were designed to be imposing and memorable.” When we first see Emily, her outfit leaves us in no doubt where she’s been these last few years. Her jumpsuit is a couture twist on the cartoonish striped getup of a jailbird. Her hooped earrings resemble separated handcuffs, and her belt reminiscent of one you might see on a member of a chain gang. Then there’s the highly-anticipated wedding itself. For the extravagant nuptials, director Paul Feig (who clearly knows a thing or two about on-screen weddings, having directed 2011 comedy “Bridesmaids”) took particular inspiration from one real life union. “Paul came to me and his team to tell us to look at this video of fashion editor, ,” Kalfus says of the lavish gathering, also held on Capri. “He wanted his movie to have the look of grandeur, and he wanted us to create an ostentatious and gorgeous wedding.” One of the film’s most memorable garments is Emily’s one-of-a-kind wedding dress — complete with 40-foot veil — designed by Kalfus herself. The gown features a bustier and leggings made of latex courtesy of designer Renee Masoomian, with a satin skirt by Tirelli Costume House. “It is an unexpected mix of beauty and harshness,” Kalfus says — the garment an embodiment of how Emily herself could be described. The extravagant veil was bordered with hundreds of crystals dipped in blood-red as a “harbinger of things to come,” according to Kalfus. The dress — latex aside — is a surprisingly traditionally feminine look for Emily. Fans may remember her appearing in several tailored (and largely monochromatic) suits throughout “A Simple Favor” — a look which was inspired by the way Feig dresses in real life. “We were trying to figure out what Blake’s look was,” explained Feig in an on-set interview during the production of the first film. “Over the course of trying to figure it out, she became enamoured with the way I dress,” he added. Kalfus, who designed the looks for both films, adds that, “Both Blake and I, we looked at each other and go ‘somebody should dress like Paul, don’t you think?’ Every day he wears a three-piece suit.” Emily’s outfits ended up making their way off screen, with Lively promoting the first film in tailored pantsuits by Ralph Lauren, Roland Mouret and Vivienne Westwood among others. In the sequel, “Emily’s style is pushed, much more heightened,” according to Kalfus. Her dresses, accessories, and the striped number worn while descending a hotel’s grand staircase (that could block out the sun for a small village) — have all increased in size. Emily’s black and white lines, neckties and waistcoats are juxtaposed with Stephanie’s colorful floral sweaters and flowing skirts. You also see Emily’s dramatic couture going toe to toe with an often dressed down Stephanie — appearing in sweatshirts and sweatpants, “showing her reluctance to be part of the wedding,” Kalfus says. When Stephanie is in more formal attire, it errs towards a more youthful femininity, while Emily’s appears more mature and domineering, lending a “psychological edge” over Stephanie, Kalfus says. That “edge” may be the key as to why Emily’s looks are so striking. However, as Dante’s mother Portia (Italian actress Elena Sofia Ricci) says, “No amount of fashion can save this wedding from being a disaster.” She may just have a point.",

    "content": "New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art came alive with tributes to as the annual Met Gala got underway Monday evening. The rain did little to dampen spirits on fashion’s big night out, where designers, models and stylists ascended the Met’s iconic — and for the night, blue-carpeted — stairs alongside A-list names from sports, arts and entertainment. This year’s hotly anticipated dress code, “Tailored for You,” was inspired by the Costume Institute’s accompanying exhibition “Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,” which explores the history of Black dandyism. The Met its annual theme is designed to “provide guidance and invite creative interpretation.” It did both, with many attendees putting a contemporary spin on zoot suits, the wide-shouldered, high-waisted suits popularized by African American men in the 1940s. Speaking to CNN ahead of his arrival at the gala, fashion designer Dapper Dan said “real dandyism” began with zoot suits, jazz and the Harlem Renaissance movement. “It’s when Black artists and creatives began to dress the way they felt,” he added. This year marked the first Met Gala dress code centered on menswear, challenging designers to reinterpret tailoring traditions for their female clients. The red carpet was awash with exaggerated suiting, from the broad shoulders of Doja Cat’s 1980s-inspired Marc Jacobs blazer to the wide-lapeled jackets sported by everyone from actor Tessa Thompson to rapper Doechii. Janelle Monáe wowed with a suit-within a suit — an outerwear jacket, printed with a blazer and necktie, that she removed to reveal an actual suit (she completed the look with a bowler hat and a clock monocle with spinning hands). Other standout tailored looks included Zendaya’s Louis Vuitton three-piece and Lupita Nyong’o’s all-aquamarine Chanel look with a matching chiffon cape and hat. The evening’s men also embraced colorful, theatrical suiting: “Bridgerton” actor Regé-Jean Page in all red, Henry Golding in — fittingly — gold and musician Bad Bunny in a loose-fitting brown two-piece paired with a Puerto Rican pava hat. Elsewhere, attendees used the theme to pay homage to individual Black icons. In the first of two red-carpet looks, Oscar-nominated actor Colman Domingo, one of the Met Gala’s co-chairs, arrived in a blue Valentino cape that evoked Vogue’s former editor-at-large André Leon Talley. Formula 1 driver (and fellow co-chair) Lewis Hamilton said his patent leather shoes were also a reference to the late fashion journalist — as was Anne Hathaway’s white-button down shirt and Carolina Herrera column dress. Others looked closer to home, with “The Bear” star Ayo Edebiri telling Vogue that her Ferragamo look nodded to the dandy men in her life, including her father. Supermodel Gigi Hadid’s Miu Miu dress was inspired by Zelda Wynn Valdes, a pioneering Black fashion designer who dressed the likes of Josephine Baker and Ella Fitzgerald, while Jodie Turner-Smith channeled equestrian Selina Lazevski. And then there were the Black icons themselves: Diana Ross, making her first appearance at the gala since 2003, arrived in a 60-pound, 18-foot-long train embroidered with the names of all her children and grandchildren.",

    "content": "Over 150 years ago, rich women from all over the world came to 7 Rue de La Paix in Paris to be dressed by couturier Charles Frederick Worth, whose eponymous fashion house, founded in 1858, continued through three generations after his death in 1895. Widely credited by historians as the “father of haute couture,” Worth was the first designer to be known by his name, and not by who wore his clothes. He gained international acclaim and shaped the way fashion was marketed and worn. His legacy is now being documented in a new exhibition, “Worth: Inventing Haute Couture,” running until September 7 at the Petit Palais art museum in Paris. A collaboration between the Petit Palais and the Palais Galliera, it is the first retrospective of the House of Worth staged in France, and the second only in the world — the last being over 60 years ago at the Brooklyn Museum in New York — and coincides with Worth’s 200th birthday this year. The Worth family’s close ties to artists during the 19th and 20th centuries and the Petit Palais’s “flamboyant architectural testament to this period,” said the museum’s director and chief curator Annick Lemoine, made Petit Palais “the perfect setting,” she told CNN ahead of the show’s opening. The exhibition encompasses the house’s work from its inception to the 1920s — when famous actresses and singers, such as Sarah Bernhardt, Sophie Croizette and Nellie Melba, wore its clothes on-stage and off. Also on show are art and design items that belonged to the Worth family, including a black lacquer screen by French Art Deco artist and designer Jean Dunand and a series of nude photographs of Worth’s great-grandson Jean-Charles taken by American visual artist Man Ray. Fragrance has also been incorporated in the exhibition, where visitors can smell a recreation of “Je Reviens,” a light powdery, floral scent by Worth. While Osmothèque, the world’s largest scent archive, based in Versailles, remade the fragrance for the exhibition, the scent itself was relaunched in 2005 by perfumer Maurice Blanchet and continues to be sold. Original Worth perfume bottles designed by René Lalique are also on display. As some of the garments are too fragile, the show will not travel internationally, said Raphaële Martin-Pigalle, chief heritage curator of the Petit Palais’s modern paintings department. Worth was born in England in 1825, where he trained with two textile merchants before heading across the Channel to work for Maison Gagelin, a clothing store in Paris, as a salesperson and dressmaker, eventually working up to becoming a partner. He then went on to establish his fashion house — initially called Worth and Bobergh, named after himself and business partner Otto Bobergh, a Swede. Worth decided what women would wear, not by creating new silhouettes, but by changing the business model. Today, haute couture fashion shows take place twice a year as designers present the latest styles for clients to pick from. But this wasn’t always the way. Before Worth, “couturiers didn’t have much latitude to invent looks,” said Sophie Grossiord, Palais Galliera’s interim director and general curator in charge of the collections from the first half of the 20th century. At the time, aristocratic women brought fabric and ideas of what they wanted to wear to couturiers, who would then produce those garments. But that wasn’t how Worth operated; instead, he designed looks that customers, if interested, could buy — subsequently turning the role of the designer, as someone who would merely serve the wealthy, to one of authority whom clients would look up to and follow guidance on how to dress. “Women come to see me to ask for my ideas, not to follow theirs,” Worth notably said to Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine, a literary and political periodical, in 1858. Worth “didn’t necessarily agree with what his clients wanted,” said Grossiord. At Worth and Bobergh, the clothes were already made, but embellishments — like woven borders, lace and fake flowers — could be added. The clothing could also be modular, with interchangeable parts such as different sleeve lengths for different times of the day, as seen in the “transformation dress” from the late 1860s. The demand for Worth’s clothes was great: During the Second French Empire from 1852 to 1870, elaborate costume balls were all the rage — and paintings shown in the Petit Palais exhibition, including Jean Béraud’s “Une Soirée” (1878), depict Worth gowns at these events. Worth’s costumes ranged from the avant-garde — like an umbrella costume from 1925, which looks like a cross between waders and an upside-down closed umbrella — to those which referenced history, like the dress made for Madame Charles-Pierre Pecoul for Princess Sagan’s ball around 1893, modeled after a painting of the infant Margaret Theresa of Spain. The house only ever made one suit for a man outside of the family: It was for the Duke of Marlborough and the most expensive costume made. Supporters of Worth included Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III and one of the leading trendsetters in Europe, who learned of Worth through her close friend, Princess Pauline von Metternich, and Valérie Feuillet (who was married to the writer Octave Feuillet), according to the show’s catalogue. As the French Empress threw her support behind Worth, he soon became the go-to name in fashion. “Worth is an authority,” French news magazine Le Monde Illustré wrote in 1868, describing him as “the absolute power in the world’s royalties.” Worth’s atelier doubled from over 500 workers in the 1860s to over 1,000 in the ’70s, as he sought to cater to clients, several of whom were European royals from across France, Russia, Austria, Spain, Portugal and Sweden. Though, a majority of Worth’s business came from customers further afield, in India, Japan, Hawaii and Egypt. American high society, which included the Astor, Morgan and Vanderbilt families, also provided a large source of income — as was emphasized towards the exhibition finale, where scenes from HBO TV series “The Gilded Age” are projected. (HBO and CNN share the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.) As the Second Empire came to an end, so did Worth and Bobergh’s partnership — the company’s founding documents say it was intended to last 12 years. There is little known about Bobergh, so the exact reasons behind his departure are unknown. But Worth carried on, with the help of his wife, Marie, and later, his sons Gaston and Jean-Philippe. With the shift in French regime to the Third Republic, tastes changed — in fashion, crinolines were out, bustles were in. Worth adapted by bringing down the flamboyancy of his clothes. But another challenge soon emerged: In the 1890s, the US significantly raised its customs duties, creating the most consequential tariff of the 19th century and Worth’s clothes became extremely costly to export. That created an opportunity for copycats in the American market to create similar-looking pieces, for cheaper prices. “The copying phenomenon was a problem for all couturiers,” Grossiord said, noting: “the copiers pillaged their ideas.” In response, in 1868 Worth founded the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture (it later became the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode and remains France’s governing fashion body) to protect the designs of French couture houses from copying and to promote the status of Paris as the fashion capital of the world. Worth also established practices that are now regarded as standard in fashion, such as using live models (Worth’s wife, Marie, was his first model) and runway shows to present new collections. Worth also photographed each of his looks and registered it by name or number. All of these were efforts to reduce the forgery of his designs. “There was a clientele we can’t even imagine,” Grossiord said, noting that while Worth’s own order books have largely disappeared, some records still exist from the early days of Louis Vuitton (whose trunks were used to transport Worth’s clothes) and Cartier (with whom the Worth family had two marriages). Among some of the most sumptuous dresses that feature in the Paris exhibition include those belonging to Countess Élisabeth Greffulhe, who was the inspiration of the Duchess of Guermantes, a character from Marcel Proust’s literary masterpiece “À la Recherche du Temps Perdu.” Worth himself was such a grand figure that he, too, has been immortalized in fiction: In his book “La Curée” (The Kill), French novelist Émile Zola based the character Worms on Worth, calling him, “the genius tailor, before whom the Second Empire’s rulers took to their knees.” Over 100 years later, thousands continue to marvel at Worth’s clothes. His legacy lives on.",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days. Megan Thee Stallion is no stranger to taking risks on the red carpet – from the sparkly Y2K-reminiscent dress she wore to the “Mean Girls” musical movie premiere in 2024, to the wave-like, body-hugging gown by Indian fashion designer Gaurav Gupta she opted for at the 2022 Oscars, to her three-tiered hairstyle at the Met Gala just last week, which channeled Black performer Josephine Baker. Saturday’s Gold Gala was no exception. The American rapper arrived at the Music Center in Los Angeles in a dramatic creation by New York-based fashion brand . The look wove aspects of the traditional Chinese qipao, or cheongsam, such as the mandarin collar and a floral pattern, with unexpected flourishes – soft, puffy sculptures encircling the bust and hip, black lace and a thigh high slit. Megan received the One House Honor at the annual event put on by non-profit Gold House – a celebration of Asian Pacific talent across entertainment, fashion, technology and more – for her support of the AAPI community through creative collaborations. “I was so excited because I wasn’t 100% sure that she would wear it,” the brand’s 32-year-old founder Kuai Li told CNN in a phone interview, of seeing the star appear in her creation. “Normally (stylists) have backups – so I was so happy to see this come true,” she said, adding that she had less than a month to design it. The Chinese-born designer said the brief was to create a look that could be modern, reference Asian design and reflect Megan’s personality. The result was a sculptural qipao that had a sci-fi slant, as two curved rings framed Megan’s midriff — almost-exposed if not for the thin weft of lace — like the dress had been run through an X-ray machine. She used fabric from her recent collection of Swallowtail Butterfly qipaos and combined it with the geometric expressions seen throughout her relatively short, but budding career (celebrities such as Kylie Jenner, Michelle Yeoh and Julia Fox have already her garments for campaigns and magazine covers). In her wider portfolio, designer Li says she fuses her background in industrial design and fashion, “obsession” with architecture and 1980s “vintage vibes” to create futuristic looks. The qipao traces its origins to robes worn by Manchu nobility during the Qing dynasty, but the garment rose in popularity and the figure-flattering silhouette we know today is largely and the city’s glamorous nightlife in the 1930s. In recent decades, both luxury and fast fashion Western brands have been accused of appropriating the garment, while people of non-Asian descent wearing versions of it have either for cultural appropriation, while others have argued it’s acceptable and celebrates Chinese culture. Li said while fashion designers should be aware of cultural appropriation she saw this as “a great opportunity to feel proud of Asian culture, especially in America,” and wanting “to try something very bold, (that would be a form of) cultural appreciation as well.” Many celebrities at the Gold Gala also wore looks by Asian designers or incorporated elements nodding to their cultural heritage. Icelandic-Chinese singer-songwriter Laufey a silver gown by Huishan Zhang, while “White Lotus” breakout star Tayme Thapthimthong his suit wearing a maroon sash with gold embellishments from Thai boutique The Phukaw. On accepting her award, Megan told the audience, “My respect and appreciation for the Asian Pacific culture extends far beyond music, and into other areas like fashion, cuisine and of course anime,” adding that she looked forward to visiting more places in Asia and working on future collaborations with the community. “Wicked” and “Crazy Rich Asians” director Jon M. Chu also took to the stage to accept the Gold Legend award and in a speech said, “We’re not just guests at the table anymore. We built the damn house, and guess what? It’s made of gold, and we’ve got more work to do.” “I’m ready, if you all are.”",

    "title": "\n      Remember when Salma Hayek ‘took a chance’ by wearing a fuzzy cardigan to Cannes?\n    ",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: Delving into the archives of pop culture history, “ ” is a CNN Style series offering a nostalgic look at the celebrity outfits that defined their eras. Was 1999 a simpler time? With dumber phones and fuss-free styling, Y2K-era nostalgia has been strong, and its fashion is no exception. What was once a daring red-carpet look wouldn’t look out of place on the streets today — namely, the peek-a-boo cardigan Salma Hayek wore to the Cannes Film Festival that year. The actor, who had two films premiering at Cannes — the Gabriel Garcia Márquez adaptation “No One Writes to the Colonel” and Kevin Smith-directed fantasy-comedy “Dogma” — paired her baby-blue short-sleeve sweater (fastened suggestively with just two buttons and a bra peeking through) with a full, flowing satin skirt in a sister shade. Hayek wore the unconventional two-piece to the amfAR Gala at Cannes, and accessorized with a silver clutch and extravagant jewelry, opting for a matching set of sapphire and diamond earrings, necklace and bracelet. Later, she traded the necklace for an elephant-shaped pendant as she with Ben Affleck, her co-star in “Dogma.” Voluminous satin silhouettes had a moment at the festival: Geraldine Chaplin wore an A-line maxi skirt in white with a plunging V-neck blouse and a dramatic stack of pearls around her neck, while Catherine Zeta-Jones went full prom queen with a halter-neck powder-pink gown. But Hayek stood out for daring to pair hers with the unexpectedly casual: a fuzzy knit. Hayek’s laissez-faire styling wasn’t contrived, either. Over 20 years later, the actor revealed that she had picked out the look herself. “It was taking a chance… I took a sweater that’s supposed to be (worn) with something underneath — because it only had two buttons — and a skirt, and made my own fashion style,” said Hayek in a recounting some of her best fashion moments for Vogue, which the Cannes fit a “look-at-me combination.” “Little did I know that Vogue one day was gonna say (it was) one of your iconic looks,” she added, explaining how the ensemble was a result of her “creativity” during a time when she didn’t have many resources to dress for the red carpet. At that point in her career, Hayek was no stranger to getting herself ready for the glitzy celebrity circuit. She told the fashion magazine that she struggled to find designers who would provide her with outfits for her earlier red-carpet appearances. “Nobody thought a Mexican would stick around, so why give me a dress?” she said. By the time Hayek stepped out in her breezy red-carpet-ready cardigan, she already had a number of innovative, self-styled looks under her belt. At the MTV Movie Awards in 1998, she accessorized a simple little black dress with a flutter of butterflies painted on her body — a nod to the era’s temporary tattoo trend, and a clever way to skip wearing expensive jewelry, she explained to Vogue. The year before, Hayek opted for a tiara at her first Academy Awards appearance, rebelling against advice from those who told her it would be “ridiculous,” she recalled. “Everybody started wearing a tiara after that and I never got credit for that trend,” she said in the video. Her suggestive, nothing-underneath cardigan has similarly become a throwback staple, popularized by brands like Reformation who them styled with satin skirts. In 2019, Katie Holmes went viral for her equally slouchy and chic and bralette, while designers like Jacquemus, whose cropped, barely-there have been a favorite of celebrities like Bella Hadid and Hailey Bieber. Though Hayek can’t get all the credit for pioneering cropped cardigans in the 1990s — the era saw Rose McGowan’s character in the cult flick “Jawbreaker” in a purple version, while Drew Barrymore, Christina Aguilera and Mena Suvari rocked them in various shades — it was a daring choice for Cannes, which is known for its strict dress code. (This week, the festival on nudity, seemingly taking aim at the ‘naked’ dress trend, as well as voluminous dresses, from official events). While Hayek now has her pick of designer pieces to wear on the red carpet, her creative combination for Cannes remains timeless. Like all the fashion beloved from the decade, it’s easy, fun — and comes in baby blue.",

    "title": "\n      Look of the Week: Alexander Skarsgård flips the script on thigh-high leather boots\n    ",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days. While much of the discussion around the Cannes film festival red carpet has been centered , Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgård bravely poses a different question: What if in 2005’s “Mr. and Mrs. Smith” Brad Pitt wore sky-high leather boots instead of Angelina Jolie? On Sunday, Skarsgård, who was attending a premiere of Wes Anderson’s latest film “The Phoenician Scheme,” arrived onto La Croisette in a jaw-dropping pair of thigh-high boots. Styled by Harry Lambert, the square-toe creations were straight off Saint Laurent’s Fall-Winter 2025 runway and engulfed the actor’s entire leg, only finishing where one might imagine his boxer shorts to begin. It was half-dominatrix, half-fishing wader, and wholly surprising. Tall leather boots have long been considered a sartorial shorthand for female sex appeal. Jolie, in her turn as the archetypal seductive assassin Jane Smith, famously wears a pair with fishnets, suspenders and a strapless PVC minidress under her satin-lined trench coat as she impersonates an escort to complete a mission. Julia Roberts’s performance as the sex worker Vivian in “Pretty Woman” (1990) wore a pair, as did Jane Fonda in her racy rendition of “Barbarella” in the ‘60s. Andy Sachs, played by Anne Hathaway, only reaches aesthetic apotheosis in “The Devil Wears Prada” (2006) after she slips on a pair of knee-high, hosiery-style leather boots. “Are you wearing…?” stutters Miranda Priestly’s vengeful and hierarchical first assistant, played by Emily Blunt, before being interrupted by Hathaway: “The Chanel boots? Yeah, I am” — a retort that has become one of the most satisfying moments of cinematic history. The history of the boot, however, is far more unisex. Thigh-highs date as far back as the 15th century, where they were typically worn by men — as demonstrated by the medieval skeleton in 2018. A potential sailor, fisherman or mudlark, the height of the boots suggested the man was working in the water when he died. They became more fashionable than functional during the Restoration period in England, where they were worn by King Charles I and his calvarymen or Cavaliers. Often complete with a heel that signified status, the riding-style leather boots could be extended fully, reaching the upper thighs, or folded down into cuffs. The boot wasn’t perceived as sexy, feminine footwear until the 1960s. In 1962, fashion designer Cristóbal Balenciaga unveiled a knee-high boot on the Fall-Winter runway. The next year, shoe designer Roger Vivier saw Balenciaga’s bet and raised him a few inches, designing a thigh-thigh silhouette for Yves Saint Laurent’s 1963 collection in alligator leather. “Ankle-deep, knee-high and even up to the thigh,” Vogue at the time. “This year’s best-looking legs will be marching up and down and back again in boots.” The rise of the thigh-high was just one of the many sartorial changes that came with the post-war “Youthquake.” Hemlines were growing shorter and attitudes to sex were changing. In the brave new world of Mary Quant’s miniskirt, a tall boot acted as the perfect picture frame for the exciting, never-before-seen terrain of a bare leg. In womenswear today, a flash of thigh is as ubiquitous as a crew neck T-shirt, but the male leg is far less familiar. Yet, the sentiment has already been embraced by actor Pedro Pascal, who donned the same Saint Laurent boots as Skarsgård in March, and labels Rick Owens, Martine Rose, Givenchy, Maison Margiela and GmbH have all designed their own pair. As we welcome daring gentleman dressers who are open to slipping on a pair of and , the over-the-knee boot is nothing more than a logical next step.",

    "content": "Kim Kardashian arrived at the courthouse in central Paris earlier this month composed, collected, and dripping in an estimated $8 million worth of jewelry. The ensemble was a bold choice, considering she was appearing at her own robbery trial, over one of the most audacious celebrity heists in modern history. She arrived alongside her mother Kris Jenner to testify against the so-called “grandpa robbers” (some suspects in their 60s and 70s, one of which died before the case went to trial, while another developed Alzheimer’s and was deemed unfit to stand), who are facing , kidnapping and conspiracy after allegedly stealing $10 million worth of cash and jewelry from the A-lister, who was held at gunpoint, during a trip to Paris in October 2016. At the trial, Kardashian was bespectacled in Alaïa sunglasses, her form accentuated in a vintage John Galliano black skirt-suit with a plunging neckline and sizeable side-slit. Kardashian’s neck alone was encircled with over 52 carats — courtesy of a tear-drop-shaped necklace from Samer Halimeh — which she paired with diamond earrings, a 4.55 carat Repossi diamond over-the-ear cuff and a white gold and diamond pavé version by Briony Raymond. The striking Halimeh piece felt like a revenge necklace signalling Kardashian’s unique ability to easily replace millions of dollars’ worth of precious jewels. To some on social media, this served as a gauché reminder of seemingly bottomless wealth. But for NYU fashion law professor and “The Laws of Style” author Douglas Hand, it was a symbol of defiance. “Her choice of jewelry really underscored the fact that she wants to announce that she’s reclaiming her power after this traumatic event,” Hand told CNN over the phone. “If I were advising her from both a business perspective and a legal perspective, I think you’d want to signal that you are a survivor.” The power of a carefully considered courtroom outfit should never be underestimated. In 2023, when Gwyneth Paltrow was taken to court for a personal injury claim over a skiing accident, she wore a series of understated, luxurious looks — including a loden coat from The Row, pants by Proenza Schouler, boots by Celine and a number of her own branded sweaters — that demographic in her favor. Several fans took to out of ten, while some even sought to at home. What could have easily become a brand-damaging episode — Paltrow’s expensive taste in ski instructors and her decision to have a post-crash massage were key elements of the prosecution — surprisingly became a masterclass in the soft power of fashion. Ultimately, the jury and found her not liable. Similarly, when author E. Jean Carroll appeared in court to testify against US President Trump in 2023, in a Bergdorf Goodman store in 1996, the writer curated a series of decorous earth-toned tailored dresses, smart jackets and off-white overcoats, which presented her as the antithesis of the “whack job” Trump had tried to label her. Despite denying the allegations and publicly insulting Carroll for making the claim, and Carroll received $5 million in damages. (A year later, she was .) Elsewhere, celebrities including Megan Thee Stallion and Cardi B have enlisted their regular red carpet stylists to help create courtroom looks that still feel authentic to them: sharp tailored suits (worn shirtless, however) with hair cut into razor-sharp bobs. According to Hand, the consideration that goes into courtroom clothes isn’t merely an exercise in vanity. “(These outfits) are pretty choreographed by any well-advised litigant,” he said. “For high profile litigants, courtroom dress is usually an attempt to dispel any appearance of wrongdoing, whether you’re charged with a crime or you’re embroiled in some dispute or a nasty divorce.” The right ensemble can also help promise “some degree of credibility,” added Hand. This seems to be the strategy of music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs, who has avoided all iterations of masculine power-suiting and instead opted for soft sweaters, glasses and undyed grey hair. The result, some argue, is a curated image that seems like a far cry from the alleged crimes. “Your apparel choices speak before you do,” Hand added. “That’s incredibly important, particularly in a high stakes situation like a court of law.” For almost as long as celebrities have been breaking the law, they have at least been dressing for the occasion. In 2002, Winona Ryder arrived at her shoplifting trial (she was accused of stealing more than $5,500 of designer goods from Saks Fifth Avenue) dressed in a Marc Jacobs trompe l’oeil knit dress that has since gone down in fashion history. Her sartorial strategy was clear: midi-skirts and dresses that were elegant, prim and demure, worn with headbands for a youthful earnestness. “How nice to see a defendant rise above the tried-and-true dark suit and opt for a more fashionable facade,” Robin Givhan at the time, in a tongue-in-cheek report for the Washington Post. Unfortunately, no matter how much her hemline communicated sweetness and light, Ryder was still found guilty and sentenced to 480 hours of community service, a $3,700 fine and 36 months of probation. When rapper Lil’ Kim was on trial for perjury in 2004, she coordinated her tailored pinstripe suit vest and slacks with those worn by her attorney Mel Sachs. In fact, several of her courtroom looks were reportedly personally gifted by Marc Jacobs — a close friend of the musician — who provided her with modest sandy-colored suits and bouclé twin-sets. But too heavy an emphasis on fashion can also backfire. When Martha Stewart was brought to trial for insider trading in 2004, her choice to wear a mink stole and chestnut-colored Hermés Birkin bag sparked controversy. “The Birkin did little to promote the image of an approachable woman who has struggled up from humble roots,” the New York Times that same year. “Instead, it cemented an image of her as a pampered fat cat seemingly willing to snatch money from an Average Joe Stockholder.” Meanwhile, when Michael Jackson arrived at court in 2005 after being accused of child molestation (he was later acquitted), the pop star showed up dressed in flamboyant brocaded vests and dazzling waistcoat jewelry — much like what he wore on stage. Ideally, said Hand, celebrities want to aim for a “sober” outfit that feels “conservative to emphasize trustworthiness.” Anything else risks sending a message of flagrance, which can sour jurors fast. Earlier this year, the realms of fashion and law enforcement intertwined even further when rapper A$AP Rocky appeared in a Los Angeles court facing charges of two counts of felony assault, one with a firearm. Rocky, who recently co-chaired the 2025 Met Gala, arrived at his trial looking strikingly dapper. His gabardine trench coat, wool chiné pants and striped satin shirt worn with sunglasses was a sophisticated, stylish take on courtroom dressing. Upon first glance, it looked like the type of paparazzi-style campaign Rocky has starred in for Italian luxury label Bottega Veneta. A few days later, a press blast distributed to journalists confirmed that Rocky had been kitted out head-to-toe in Saint Laurent. When the media alert was sent, Rocky — who has now been acquitted on all charges — was still the lead suspect in an ongoing criminal trial. But Saint Laurent was not deterred by the questionable backdrop, continuing to send multiple releases after each new courtroom appearance. It surprised even a senior fashion public relations executive in London, who said they would advise PRs to avoid sharing outfit details and shopping links when pieces have been worn to sensitive events. “It’s not appropriate to be shouting about them wearing your brand in those contexts,” they said. “It’s tacky.” (Saint Laurent did not respond to requests from CNN for comment.) But the French luxury house isn’t the only brand hoping to captialize on the free press that comes with highly publicized lawsuits. In 2024, Anna Delvey — the “fake heiress” who was found guilty of , in 2019 — used one of her immigration court appearances to promote emerging fashion label Shao New York by wearing a custom outfit by the brand (the designer is a client of the , a venture Delvey began with publicisit Kelly Cutrone in 2023). In Kardashian’s case, she was not appearing as a person convicted of a crime but rather a veritable victim. “The appearance of wrongdoing was not anything that she needed to address,” said Hand. Instead of sending a message to the judge and jury, as is usually the goal of a celebrity courtroom outfit, Kardashian’s diamonds spoke directly to the public. What they were really intended to say, however, isn’t crystal clear.",

    "content": "‘Naked dresses’ may be out, but flat shoes — according to the official Cannes Film Festival dress code — are in. It’s a sartorial judgement that may feel well overdue, after a group of women made headlines in 2015 for being reportedly refused entry to a screening for their ground-height footwear. While the festival has never officially stated such a rule, according to event organizer Thierry Fremaux, who in 2015 asserted on X that    a heels-only mandate did not exist, the perceived preference for high heels led to a backlash known as #flatgate, criticizing the perceived pressure on women. It set in motion a series of mini red-carpet protests and conversations around the inherent misogyny embedded in gendered dress codes. In 2016, Julia Roberts walked the Cannes red carpet barefoot in the ultimate act of defiance. Two years later, Kirsten Stewart tiptoed around the rule by arriving in stilettos and pointedly removing them when arriving at the photographer’s pit. In 2023, Jennifer Lawrence inadvertently reignited the conversation when she lifted up her Dior haute couture ball gown to descend the Croisette, revealing a surprisingly pedestrian-looking pair of black flip flops (she maintains the decision wasn’t deliberately disobedient, and that the shoes she had originally intended to wear were one size too big). For the last few years, however, the festival has expressed written permission for guests to wear shoes and sandals “with or without a heel” — stipulating only that they were “elegant.” Slowly but surely, more celebrities are taking the bait. In 2024, Jane Fonda attended the festival wearing a pair of silver Margaux Mary Janes while Margaret Qualley opted for a pair of Chanel sequined ballet flats. This year, film directors Alice Rohrwacher and Molly Manning Walker wore Prada loafers onto the Croisette, while actor Llúcia Garcia arrived in black leather lace-up ballet flats. For the most part, flat shoes have long been considered the domain of the elderly, the clumsy or the unfashionable. In Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie,” Margot Robbie must choose (red pill, blue pill style) between a stiletto and a Birkenstock. When her arches collapse and her heels touch the floor, Barbie is treated with as much trepidation as a contagious biohazard by the other dolls. “Flat feet!” gasps Hari Nef in her role as Doctor Barbie. After Carrie Bradshaw’s hip surgery in season two of “Sex and the City” reboot “And Just Like That…” her main concern was being unable to slip into a teetering pair of Manolo Blahniks — revealing that she hadn’t bought a pair of flats in over a decade. (The television series and sequel aired on HBO and Max, respectively, which share the same parent company as CNN: Warner Bros. Discovery.) Previously, any sightings of low-profile footwear at Cannes have been few and far between: Uma Thurman in 2011, Karlie Kloss in 2014, Susan Sarandon in 2016. “It’s a misconception that to look dressy one needs huge heels,” French fashion designer and model Inès de la Fressange — who has regularly flouted Cannes’ unofficial flat ban — told Vogue in 2015. “Were Greek ancient statues wearing heels with their togas? Did Cleopatra wear platforms?” Now, a decade on from #flatgate, the much-maligned footwear is finally welcomed onto one of the most historic and glamorous red carpets in the world. But can they rise to the occasion? There is indication that they already have. According to Pinterest Trends, searches for “ballet flats” in the US were up around 190% this month compared to data collected in May 2023. (Growth in searches for high heels across the same time period was 53%.) Meanwhile, almost twice as many people worldwide were searching for “Mary Janes” than in 2023, according to Google Trends data. At New York Fashion Week in September 2024, fashion label Tory Burch resurrected the Reva — a round-toe ballet flat that comes in soft or patent leather, stamped with the label’s circular medallion — that had been out of production since 2017. The glitzy pump was launched in 2006 and sold five million pairs in just seven years, before appetite for slim, dainty shoes dropped off in the mid-to-late 2010s. The death knell was the advent of the “Dadcore” chunky trainers movement (think Balenciaga Triple S sneakers or the Fila Disruptors — both of which were released the same year the Reva was put to rest). Now, it appears, ballet flats rule the roost once more. Sandy Liang’s rehearsal-ready satin Pointe toe shoe ($550) was the cult item that put the designer on the map, with the first batch launched in 2022 selling out in just two days. Alaïa’s crystal Mary Jane flats — a rhinestone studded black leather pump with a matching over-the-foot strap that retails for $1,350 — was first introduced in 2022, yet the embellished style still came fourth in Lyst’s ranking of the hottest fashion products last year. Perhaps coincidentally, Miu Miu (one of the few luxury brands defying a global downturn) boasts a remarkably varied and long-standing flat-shoe offering — with 14 styles on their site currently priced from $875 to $1,790. “I think people want alternatives, and shoes they can walk in,” observed Mosha Lundström Halbert, a fashion journalist and social media commentator under the handle @newsfash. For Lundström Halbert, the comeback of the flat shoe is partly down to a new generation of shoppers coming of age in a more flexible corporate environment. “When I first started out as a fashion editor in 2008, you wore heels to work,” she said over the phone. “Even when I was an intern, I was in a Givenchy by Ricardo Tisci stiletto, because that’s what (actor turned designer) Ashley Olsen wore.” Office dress codes have also evolved as a result of hybrid working styles. “It’s more socially acceptable to wear something that previously would have been viewed as quite casual,” Lundström Halbert said. “It’s probably easier for a lot of consumers to justify spending on a flat that they know they’re going to wear all summer long, than it is a pair of stilettos that are really only for select occasions,” she added. As high heels become less of a requisite in certain arenas, the Cannes red carpet — whose ostentation is rivaled only by the Met Gala or the Oscars — is something of a final frontier. “I think we’re re-examining a lot of tropes right now in society when it comes to how women are meant to present,” said Lundström Halbert. “We’re moving towards integrating the way people dress in real life on the red carpet for (those outfits) to resonate and stand out.” Plus, as Lundström Halbert noted, “there’s something (about a flat shoe) that breaks free from the pageantry of it all. It’s refreshing.”",

    "title": "\n      The world’s largest architectural model captures New York City in the ’90s\n    ",

    "content": "The Empire State building stands approximately 15 inches tall, whereas the Statue of Liberty measures at just under two inches without its base. At this scale, even ants would be too big to represent people in the streets below. These lifelike miniatures of iconic landmarks can be found on the Panorama — which, at 9,335 square feet, is the largest model of New York City, meticulously hand-built at a scale of 1:1,200. The sprawling model sits in its own room at the Queens Museum, where it was first installed in the 1960s, softly rotating between day and night lighting as visitors on glass walkways are given a bird’s eye view of all five boroughs of the city. To mark the model’s 60th anniversary, which was celebrated last year, the museum has published a new book offering a behind-the-scenes look at how the Panorama was made. Original footage of the last major update to the model, completed in 1992, has also gone on show at the museum as part of a 12-minute video that features interviews with some of the renovators. The Queens Museum’s assistant director of archives and collections, Lynn Maliszewski, who took CNN on a visit of the Panorama in early March, said she hopes the book and video will help to draw more visitors and attention to the copious amount of labor — over 100 full-time workers, from July 1961 to April 1964 — that went into building the model. “Sometimes when I walk in here, I get goosebumps, because this is so representative of dreams and hopes and family and struggle and despair and excitement… every piece of the spectrum of human emotion is here (in New York) happening at the same time,” said Maliszewski. “It shows us things that you can’t get when you’re on the ground.” The Panorama was originally built for the 1964 New York World’s Fair, then the largest international exhibition in the US, aimed at spotlighting the city’s innovation. The fair was overseen by Robert Moses, the influential and notorious urban planner whose highway projects New Yorkers. When Moses commissioned the Panorama, which had parts that could be removed and redesigned to determine new traffic patterns and neighborhood designs, he saw an opportunity to use it as a city planning tool. Originally built and revised with a margin of error under 1%, the model was updated multiple times before the 1990s, though it is now frozen in time. According to Maliszewski, it cost over $672,000 to make in 1964 ($6.8 million in today’s money) and nearly $2 million (about $4.5 million today) was spent when it was last revised in 1992. As to why the Panorama hasn’t had another update since, Maliszewski believes that the labor and financial resources required to capture three decades of new buildings would be “unparalleled.” Additionally, the unique nature of modelmaking requires specialists that are hard to come by. While the craft was once utilized by many architects, city planners and designers, it has largely been replaced by digital modeling, Maliszewski explained. Nonetheless, the model’s historical accuracy adds to its charm. “What we’re looking at is January 1, 1992, which is bonkers, as far as thinking about how much has changed (and) how many whole neighborhoods would not even be recognizable if you shrunk yourself down and were on this model,” Maliszewski said. “The world continues to evolve so quickly, right? But in (New York) city, infrastructurally, it’s at an even faster clip.” The Panorama is supported by 497 steel legs, with layers of wood and foam that were sculpted to resemble the topography of New York City, according to the book. Tiny bridges made of brass and several acrylic cars, buses, trains and subway cars adorn the model, which was originally designed to be walked across by visitors — at least for the areas with flatter and smaller buildings and large waterways and parks. The model contains around 895,000 replica buildings, including brownstones and private homes, made through acrylic injection molding, and distinctive structures, such as skyscrapers, museums and churches, made from hand-painted wood and paper. From the five updates that took place between its original construction and the last renovation, the most prominent additions include the gigantic World Trade Center complex — the twin towers are still represented on the model — as well as Battery Park City, a former landfill that was redeveloped in the 1970s, and the Lincoln Center, the city’s cornerstone for arts and culture. Among the notably missing new landmarks, however, is the Hudson Yards neighborhood (also home to one of CNN’s headquarters), the High Line, a 1.45-mile-long walkway converted from a freight railroad in the late 2000s, and the numerous “super-skinny” skyscrapers now dominating parts of the city’s skyline. One of the crew members involved in the 1992 revision, Tom Jarrow, remembers seeing the model during the 1964-1965 World Fair, when he was about seven years old. At the time, there was a plastic tracked car “helicopter” ride that circled around its perimeter, allowing riders to view the model city at a simulated 20,000 foot elevation. “Looking at (the model), it’s daunting to think that any set of human beings could create something so massive and large (with) so much detail,” Jarrow told CNN on a phone call. Jarrow, who had worked for Lester & Associates, the origin architectural modelmakers of the Panorama, for 15 years before starting his own exhibit specialist company, S-Tech Associates, recalled some of the meticulous tasks carried out during the renovation, which marked the only time the model, weighing about 45,000 pounds, had ever been removed from the room it currently sits in. Some of the labor included acid etching the finer details of the windows and doorways, casting hundreds of new shapes for additional buildings, and producing tiny trees and shrubbery from painted sponges. “If we had 3D printers back then, it would have been fantastic — we could have 3D printed everything, but everything was done by hand,” Jarrow said. Jarrow’s main work was electrical — the Panorama used to be lit up by over 3,000 tiny colored light bulbs that needed to be manually unscrewed each time one needed to be replaced. As part of the renovation, Jarrow updated the model with brighter lights, although he had to use technology that even at the time was considered outdated because of price restrictions, he recalled. “There’s miles and miles of wires underneath that model, and it’s all low voltage lighting,” he said. Most of the bulbs, which originally served to color code different municipal facilities around the city, are no longer functioning today. Both Jarrow and Maliszewski agree that the current model would benefit from a more modernized lighting system that would be easier to manage, and also be more interactive for guests, which the museum is working to achieve by 2027 through a grant funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services. Additionally, the museum would like to digitally add subway lines, which do not currently feature on the model but plays a key role in the average New Yorker’s experience, said Maliszewski. To maintain the model’s appearance, it is cleaned by the museum in its entirety at least twice a year. From dusting its intricate features with brushes of different sizes to using a low intensity vacuum to carefully suck up the dust, it’s a process that can take up to two weeks, Maliszewski said. To finance the museum’s efforts, a long-running program allows visitors to “adopt” a piece of the model, whether that is their apartment building, a restaurant, a park or any other feature that speaks to them. By paying a yearly “rent” or donation to the museum, they can receive a deed to owning a property on the model. “This model brings out so much for people, as far as their history and nostalgia and memory,” Maliszewski said, adding it shows that “we’re really not that far apart from each other, even if you never leave your neighborhood, or if you never leave your borough… there’s still millions of people just a few miles away from you.” Editor’s Note: “",

    "title": "\n      North Korea unveils new 10,000-home showpiece residential district\n    ",

    "content": "As slowly emerges from five years of self-imposed pandemic isolation, a glittering new high-rise neighborhood in the capital Pyongyang is taking center stage. Photos of the 10,000-apartment development, released by state news agency KCNA after the country’s leader Kim Jong Un inspected the site Saturday, show residential skyscrapers spilling out from a wide boulevard in the new district, Hwasong. The project is part of a major construction drive in the capital, and across much of the internationally isolated, authoritarian nation, intended to improve living standards. The homes are part of an ambitious five-year plan, announced in 2021, to build 50,000 additional apartments in Pyongyang, where residents’ quality of life is considerably higher than elsewhere in the impoverished country. But despite the gleaming images of Pyongyang’s new skyline, high-rise living in North Korea is not necessarily a symbol of luxury. Frequent power outages mean that elevators in residential buildings often do not function, making daily life difficult for those living in upper floors. As a result, younger residents are typically assigned higher apartments, while older residents are moved to lower floors to minimize the physical strain of climbing stairs, as witnessed by CNN during multiple visits to the country. Housing shortages remain a significant challenge for North Korea, which is also grappling with a faltering economy, surging commodity prices, and ongoing food insecurity. A by researchers from South Korea’s Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology suggested that the country only has enough homes to accommodate 70% to 80% of its households. Outside of the showpiece capital, many homes are dilapidated and lack consistent access to electricity, clean water and sewage services. The new neighborhood features numerous tall towers — two of which are connected by a soaring skybridge — as well as “educational, commercial and service facilities,” according to state media. KCNA claimed that Kim was closely involved in the design and “energetically led the work of drawing up the construction plan.” Kim’s site visit comes ahead of the official opening ceremony on April 15, one of the country’s most important public holidays, celebrating the birthday of his grandfather, North Korea’s late founder, Kim Il Sung. The opening will complete the third stage of construction at Hwasong, an area described by state media as a “beautiful and modern urban quarter” that signifies “a new era of prosperity” for Pyongyang. Pyongyang has been largely closed off to visitors since North Korea shut its borders in response to the Covid-19 pandemic more than five years ago. A small number of visited the city in 2024, though the capital was off-limits to the international tour group that last month before trips were again suspended. The latter group was only permitted to visit Rason, a special economic zone near the country’s border with China and Russia. Hwasong is the latest in a series of recent urban developments in Pyongyang, which is known for its . Other large residential projects have been built around Mirae Scientists Street and Songhwa Street, where the country’s second tallest building — the Songhwa Street Main Tower — was completed in 2022. North Korea is also expanding housing beyond Pyongyang, building thousands of homes in mining towns and rural areas. While these projects aim to modernize the country, they rely on soldiers and civilian laborers working under harsh conditions with little pay. Housing is assigned by the government, prioritizing those who are considered most loyal to the ruling Kim family and people working in sectors considered most valuable to the nation, such as scientists and engineers. State media has previously boasted about the pace of construction in the capital, dubbing it “Pyongyang Speed.” Officials claim to have completed the frame of a 70-story skyscraper at the capital’s Ryomyong New Town in just 74 days. But experts have expressed concerns about the quality of the construction materials and workmanship on the country’s building projects — especially after a Pyongyang apartment building, which may have housed dozens of families, collapsed in 2014. State media attributed the disaster, for which no official death count was disclosed, to “sloppy building” and “irresponsible supervision of officials.” North Korea’s military, which plays a central role in the country’s construction projects, has likely been instrumental in completing the new district, as it has with previous large-scale developments. There are more than 1 million active-duty personnel and conscription is mandatory. Most men are required to serve for at least ten years, starting from age 17, often without any contact with their families. Even after serving, they remain part of a civil paramilitary force, numbering in the millions. Kim has recently signaled that his government’s construction plans now stretch beyond the five-year targets announced in 2021. Last month, he said the capital’s “rundown and old” neighborhoods will also be redeveloped in the near future. CNN’s Yoonjung Seo contributed to this report.",

    "content": "There are a few constants that the Internet knows about Lenny Kravitz’s lifestyle. Photos of him wearing an enormous brown blanket scarf, which resurface each year, have become a reliable indicator of the approaching winter. And he’s never far from a pair of leather pants, which the 60-year-old American musician proved last year when he posted a video to TikTok bench pressing while doing sit-ups at the gym in black leather, a sheer mesh tank and sunglasses. (“This isn’t how everyone’s dad works out?” his daughter, the actor Zoë Kravitz, asked “The Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon in response to the video). But over the years, the rock star has also provided a window into his life through his homes, from the idyllic Brazilian ranch that Architectural Digest (AD) toured in 2019, to the beachside Airstream trailer he occupies for part of the year in the Bahamian island of Eleuthera. For , published today, Kravitz is showing off the grand Paris townhouse he has had for two decades and was the previous palatial home of a countess. Kravitz was taken aback by the enormous space when he first saw it, located in the 16th arrondissement, the French capital’s home to embassies, museums and luxury shopping. In the early 2000s, he had already released several Platinum albums, but had in mind something more modest: “a little apartment, maybe on the Seine — one bedroom, two bedrooms, maximum — where I could write and hang out,” he to AD. It was his real estate agent who encouraged him to see the “once-in-a-generation” listing, he added. When he arrived, he thought perhaps he was touring a single floor, not the entire property. “I said, ‘No, no, no, no, absolutely not.’” Inside though, his feelings changed. “I walked in and said, ‘This is my house.’ Spiritually, I knew.” Years later, the home feels undeniably his — “a true reflection of his personality and creative energy,” noted Marina Hemonet, head of editorial content for AD France, in an email to CNN. From the airy interiors outfitted with work by blue-chip artists, traditional African art and some of his own studio’s furniture designs — Kravitz Design was included in the prestigious AD100 list in 2023 — to the eccentric wine room and red-lit subterranean party space he calls “The Chaufferie,” the musician has continued to transform the space as an extension of himself. (Though he’s not the only Kravitz to enjoy the home, as Zoë has “been having a lot of soirées” in the speakeasy-esque boiler room, he told AD.) “The things he surrounds himself with — (Andy) Warhol masterpieces, African artifacts, major music memorabilia, and rare furnishings by Paul Evans, Karl Springer, Afra and Tobia Scarpa, Joe Colombo, and others — offer an astounding feast of the dreamily recherché,” AD’s global editorial director, Amy Astley, who leads AD U.S., wrote in the issue’s editor’s letter. Kravitz’s sensibility reflects his upbringing, he noted to the magazine. He often moved between his parents’ Upper East Side apartment in Manhattan — his mother, Roxie Roker, was an actor best known for “The Jeffersons;” his father, Sy Kravitz, was a TV producer for NBC — to his grandparents’ home in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. “Two completely different worlds,” he said. He calls his aesthetic “soulful elegance,” which is “comfortable, clearly. But also chic,” he explained. “I love that balance of African, European, and Afrofuturism mixed with midcentury pieces. I love things that are extremely glamorous and also extremely brutal.” And though artworks by Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Richard Avedon hang on his walls, it’s a portrait by the photographer Ruven Afanador of Kravitz’s late grandfather, Albert Roker, that he considers a centerpiece of his home. Afanador photographed the cover for the musician’s fourth album, “Circus,” released in 1995, and his grandfather attended the shoot. “I put my grandfather in one of my suits, and Ruven took a bunch of portraits of him. He is why I am here, and why I’m in this house, why my mom went to Howard University in DC and studied at the Shakespeare Institute in Stratford-upon-Avon and became who she became, then I became who I became, and Zoë became who she became,” Kravitz said. “It’s all him. So he presides over the table at all times.”",

    "content": "Antoni Gaudí, the celebrated Catalan long nicknamed “God’s architect” for designing Sagrada Família, has been put on the path to sainthood by the Vatican. In a statement released on Monday, the Vatican said recognized Gaudí’s “heroic virtues,” which is a step on the path to sainthood. Becoming a saint is a complex process that can take hundreds of years, however, since a candidate normally needs two miracles to be attributed to their intercession. Finding those miracles will be the next step if Gaudí is to beatified and then canonized. Commissions of doctors and theologians then examine the miracles before the pope makes the ultimate decision to canonize someone. Gaudí is a rare case. Few artists become saints and no architect, in the modern understanding of the profession, has ever been canonized. Gaudí’s legacy is intrinsically linked with Catholicism as he dedicated much of his career to the Sagrada Família – a church of such awesome splendor that it remains unfinished more than 140 years after construction began. He envisioned the church to be “a Bible in stone” and designed a monumental structure with 18 huge, spindle-shaped towers, each symbolizing a different biblical figure – the 12 apostles, the four evangelists, the Virgin Mary and Jesus. When it is finally completed in 2026, the tower of Jesus Christ will stand at 172.5 meters (566 feet) tall and will be finished with a 17-meter-tall (56-foot) four-armed cross, making it the world’s tallest church. Inside, the nave is bathed in multicolored light that streams in from every direction through ornately decorated stained-glass windows. Gaudí never saw the church anywhere near completion. He died in 1926, when only an estimated 10%-15% of the project had been built, including one transept, a crypt and some of the apse wall. Although Gaudí dedicated the remaining few years of his life and career exclusively to the Sagrada Família, other buildings bearing his distinctive style are dotted all over Barcelona, lending the city much of its character. For decades, there has been a movement calling for Gaudí’s beatification, known as the Association for the Beatification of Antoni Gaudí. The Archbishop of Barcelona took up that cause in 2023 and submitted the or key argument, for Gaudí’s beatification to the Vatican. CNN’s Jack Guy and Amarachi Orie contributed reporting.",

    "content": "Construction of the unoccupied skyscraper may resume as early as next week, almost 10 years after work ground to a halt, according to Chinese state media. The 597-meter-tall (1,959-foot) Goldin Finance 117, which topped out in the northern Chinese port city of Tianjin but has stood unfinished since 2015 amid major financial difficulties, is now expected to complete in 2027. At 117 stories high, the tower was set to be China’s tallest skyscraper when it broke ground in 2008. The soaring structure was built using “mega columns” to protect against strong winds and earthquakes, while its “walking stick” design was topped by a diamond-shaped atrium containing a swimming pool and observation deck. It was set to contain offices and a five-star hotel on the upper floors, according to . But the project came to a standstill following the 2015 that plunged the future of Hong Kong-based Goldin Properties Holdings into doubt. The real estate developer, whose founder Pan Sutong was once among Hong Kong’s richest businessmen, has since gone into liquidation. A new construction permit — which reportedly lists a contract value of almost 569 million yuan ($78 million) — suggests the defunct developer’s title may have been dropped from the building’s name, according to state media. It is unclear whether plans for the “supertall” skyscraper’s use remain unchanged. Neither P&T Group nor BGI Engineering Consultants, the state-owned company named on the permit, responded to CNN’s requests for comment. Over the last decade, the abandoned skyscrapers littering China’s skylines have become emblematic of the country’s real estate woes. In 2020, its housing ministry and National Development and Reform Commission banning new towers over 500 meters (1,640 feet) in height — a move seemingly aimed, in part, at reining in the speculative financing often underpinning skyscraper projects. On Monday, China’s Greenland Group announced that work is also resuming on the previously stalled Chengdu Greenland Tower in the southwestern city of Chengdu, local state-owned media reported. Construction of the 468-meter-tall (1,535-foot) skyscraper has been on hold since 2023, after the state-owned developer encountered financial difficulties, . The fact that two high-profile projects are resuming at the same time is unlikely to be a coincidence, said Qiao Shitong, a law professor at Duke University School of Law and the author of two books on Chinese real estate. “The national government has made it clear it wants to stabilize the real estate market,” said Qiao over a video call, adding that it has been encouraging local governments to help “revive” the struggling sector. “It is signaling to the market — (it’s) not only about the skyscrapers themselves.” Although the Tianjin tower’s new financing is yet to be disclosed, Qiao believes the state has offered investment and debt restructuring to help kickstart the project. “(Supertall skyscrapers) are not necessarily the most efficient projects and they are not necessarily making profits, but they are indicators,” he said. “By having this project revived and completed, the government at least hopes it can increase people’s confidence.” For local officials, completing abandoned skyscrapers is also about “the image of the city,” said Fei Chen, a reader in architecture and urban design at the UK’s University of Liverpool. “They don’t want a project to be unfinished and to stay like that, which is an eyesore for everyone.” Chen stressed, however, that the resumption of projects in Tianjin and Chengdu is unlikely to herald a return to the “vanity projects” of recent years. “The government is conscious that although these (skyscraper) projects have some positive effects on the area, they require too much investment and are not financially or environmentally sustainable… I think the general urban development trend is not changed by the fact that some projects are being resumed. I think it’s more about local government efforts to make their city better.” Despite economic concerns and tightening regulations, China continues to dominate global skyscraper construction. Of the 133 skyscrapers measuring 200 meters or above completed around the world last year, 91 were in China, according to from the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. Chen said that skyscrapers, although expensive to build, are often used by developers as “magnets” for investment in the surrounding area. Goldin Finance 117, for instance, was part of a wider development containing villas, commercial buildings and offices, as well as a convention center, entertainment center and polo club. The fate of these projects is not explicitly outlined in the new construction permit, though it reportedly describes the development of several “commercial corridors.” But with sluggish property sales and struggling office occupancy rates across China, the project’s economic viability remains in question, said Qiao. “It’s a huge investment,” he added “And I seriously don’t know who is going to buy or rent this commercial space.” During the decade-long hiatus, Tianjin welcomed another supertall skyscraper — the Tianjin CTF Finance Centre, which at 530 meters (1,739 feet) is currently the world’s eighth tallest completed building. Goldin Finance 117 has meanwhile been surpassed in height by both the twisting Shanghai Tower and the Ping An Finance Centre in Shenzhen, meaning it would now only become the country’s third tallest (and the world’s sixth tallest) skyscraper upon completion. It will fall to eighth globally if Saudi Arabia’s kilometer-high Jeddah Tower — on which construction also following a years-long hiatus — and Dubai’s are both completed later this decade.

    "content": "Though it only had the distinction of being the world’s tallest building for 11 months, the Chrysler Building in midtown Manhattan has remained one of the most recognizable skyscrapers in the world — and a glimmering architectural icon of the Art Deco period, which celebrates its centennial on April 28. The 1920s and 1930s gave rise to buildings such as Chicago’s Tribune Tower and New York’s Waldorf Astoria hotel that mixed materials and colors through the use of steel, glass, terracotta, stone and marble. This new modern style prized vertical designs that drew the eye upwards, decorative glass and metalwork with geometric and floral motifs, high-shine lacquered surfaces, and unique sculptural adornments — overall, a movement toward originality instead of references to the past. “Until the 1920s, American architects tended to design their buildings with one eye looking over their left shoulder of Europe,” said Anthony W. Robins, a founding member and former vice president of The Art Deco Society of New York, in a phone call. Architectural styles in the US often followed revivals popular across the West, he noted, such as the Greek, Romanesque and Italian Renaissance revivals that fell in and out of favor. But Art Deco didn’t have a name for decades; in 1966, during renewed interest in the era, a group of curators named the style after the “Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes,” which took place on April 28, 1925 in Paris and drew some 16 million visitors over seven months, forging a new period of architecture, design and decorative arts that influenced many parts of the world. The 1,046-foot-tall Chrysler Building, completed in May of 1930, was the pinnacle of both the then-unnamed Art Deco period and the skyscraper boom that rapidly transformed New York City’s skyline. It dethroned the Eiffel Tower as the world’s tallest structure, and was only eclipsed by the Empire State Building before such lofty projects came to a halt as the global economy cratered during the Great Depression, Robins noted. “(The Chrysler Building) and the Empire State Building were the culmination of this huge skyscraper race,” he said. “They weren’t the last to open up before the Depression put an end to it, but they were … the two that took the title of the ‘world’s tallest building.’” Designed by the architect William van Alen for the automotive magnate Walter P. Chrysler, who took over the project from the developer and politician William H. Reynolds, the tower features a steel frame and white and gray bricks that ascend skyward with three vertical columns of windows on each side, flanked by horizontal rows that appear like notches at each level. Climaxing with a cascade of curvilinear sunbursts at its peak, it tapers off to a gleaming 185-foot-tall spire — one that had to be secretly assembled and erected from the inside to deliver on its promise to become the world’s new tallest building. During construction, the Chrysler’s superlative was at risk by a structure rising in tandem at 40 Wall Street. Though the New York Times in October 1929 that Paul Starrett, the downtown building’s developer, denied competing for “height supremacy,” the building plans had changed to accommodate additional floors. The press played up the rivalry over the course of a year, Robins noted, until Van Alen resolved it by having the spire covertly assembled from five parts on the 65th floor and quickly hoisted up in 90 minutes so that competitors would not know its final height until it was completed. With the Empire State Building on the horizon, as well as plans for other supertalls that were never built — including the Noyes Building, a monumental, four-block wide, 1,600-foot-tall terracotta tower that, in New York’s skyline, would have only fallen short of One World Trade Center today — the Chrysler Building was the symbol of a rapidly changing skyline. “What next February’s skyline will be like it would take a rash guesser to say,” the New York Times journalist H.I. Brock wrote in 1930 of the year ahead. “But it will be different. July’s skyline will be a new skyline, for that matter.” What makes the Chrysler Building so striking can be attributed, in part, to the experimentation of the Art Deco period, with its variety of textures, colors and materials, including its use of Nirosta steel: a new type of rustproof stainless steel from Germany. “The color in the metal — that extraordinary silvery glow of the Nirosta at the top — it just stands out. You get there when the sun hits it on a good day, and it knocks your socks off,” Robins said. But one landmark piece of legislation also contributed to its visual appeal, Robin said. New York City’s 1916 Zoning Resolution — the first citywide zoning code in the US to be established — included a requirement that large buildings taper off as they rise  so as not to block the sun. Van Alen used the Chrysler Building’s five step-like setbacks to vary the design at each level, including ornaments on each ledge. Steel eagle heads and sculptural pineapples can be spotted on different levels, as well as replicas of Chrysler’s 1929 radiator hub caps — a tribute to innovation as well as a direct reference to the building’s original owner. “It’s very common among Art Deco skyscrapers that the ornaments, aside from being ornamental, will… tell us who the building was built for and include the building itself in the ornament somewhere,” Robins said. Those motifs continue inside, where the skyscraper’s dramatic vertical entrances of polished black granite and recessed glass panels lead visitors into the red marble and yellow travertine lobby. On the ceiling, Edward Trumbull’s monumental mural, “Transport and Human Endeavor,” is dedicated to the human ingenuity and technology that created the building, with a depiction of the skyscraper itself included. For all its favorable attention today, the Chrysler Building was completed to mixed reviews. Architecture critics considered the last-minute spire to be a stunt, to the New York Times. In 1931, the acclaimed critic Lewis Mumford : “Heaven help the person who critically looks at this building without the help of distance and heavy mists. The ornamental treatment of the facade is a series of restless mistakes.” The architectural tides also shifted drastically as the International Style architectural movement swiftly rose to prominence in the 1930s, prizing functionality in its blocky concrete forms with no decor — the antithesis of its predecessors. But with Art Deco’s revival in the 1960s — along with its official name — as well as the skyscraper’s designation as a federal and city landmark in 1976 and 1978, respectively, the Chrysler Building’s renown grew with time. That wasn’t the case for its architect, however, as Van Alen’s promising career dwindled, and he became mired in litigation with his client, Chrysler, over payment for the project. (The courts ultimately ruled in Val Alen’s favor and he received his fee.) “The Chrysler is building in his life, and it was the last major building in his life,” Robins said. Though the building was completed in 1930, it took until 1981 for Van Alen’s full vision to be realized, when lighting technicians illuminated the skyscraper’s crown for the first time according to the architect’s original designs. “There’s no spire that looks anything like that,” Robins said. “You’re flying over Manhattan — that’s the one that just catches your eye.”",

    "content": "A pair of gently curved bridges, a bronze oak tree and a lily pad-inspired walkway are among the standout features of five shortlisted designs for official memorial site in central London. The national memorial will be built in St. James’s Park, near Buckingham Palace in the heart of the British capital. The finalists, unveiled Wednesday, include some of the UK’s most prominent architecture firms, including Foster + Partners, which designed London’s City Hall and 30 St. Mary Axe (known as The Gherkin), and Heatherwick Studios, the firm behind . A panel from The Queen Elizabeth Memorial Committee, which was jointly established by the British government and Royal Household, will announce a winning proposal this summer, according to a press release. The memorial is expected to be unveiled in 2026, marking what would have been the late Queen’s centenary. The design brief asked for “an emotionally powerful place” that celebrates Elizabeth II’s “extraordinary life of service,” while providing the public with a space for reflection. “She was part of our national identity and helped to define our values, she gave us a sense of continuity through times of great change, she was integral to recognizing achievement and she exemplified service and duty, strengthened by faith and leavened by pragmatism, optimism and humor,” said committee chair Lord Janvrin, the late Queen’s former private secretary, in the press release. “The masterplan design needs to seek inspiration from all this,” he added. “The memorial must be — simply — a beautiful place, a place to visit with friends, a place to gather, to enjoy, and to reflect on an extraordinary life.” The public can view the finalists’ designs as part of an online exhibition and can provide feedback until May 19. To honor Britain’s longest-reigning monarch, Heatherwick Studio proposed an entry with a lily-themed bridge at its heart (pictured top). In a video introducing the design, the firm’s founder said Elizabeth II’s values of “togetherness and unity” led his team to conceptualize a “Bridge of Togetherness” that would serve as a gathering place in the park. The design features a sculpture of the late monarch protected by a canopy of “sculptural lilies” at the center of a limestone bridge. The proposal also includes a pathway of 70 limestone “lily pads” signifying the Queen’s 70-year reign, as well as plants that held significance for her. “Like her legacy, it is quietly monumental,” reads the firm’s entry. “A memorial grown from the landscape, open to people throughout the world from every walk of life.” Another design looking to themes of harmony was proposed by Foster + Partners, which was inspired by British architect John Nash’s 1820s remodeling of St. James’s Park. The design consists of gardens connected by a network of meandering paths and linked by a “Unity Bridge” symbolizing the Queen as “a powerful force for bringing together people, nations, charities, the Commonwealth, and the Armed Forces,” the firm’s founder, architect , said in a video entry. The pathways will feature Elizabeth II’s words, both as audio installations and inscriptions on the path, including a quote from her 1953 coronation speech: “Throughout all my life and with all my heart I shall strive to be worthy of your trust.” Proposed sculptures include new figurative statues of the Queen and Prince Philip, as well as a “Wind Sculpture” designed by the British artist Yinka Shonibare, intended to serve as a place of “reflection and shared experience.” The proposal from landscape architecture studio J&L Gibbons centers on a vision of the late Queen as “the nation’s bedrock” by incorporating a bridge made of literal bedrock. Its layout also “invites forest bathing” in a series of glades surrounded by trees. In its proposal video, the firm said its design represents a quote from the Queen’s in which she spoke to breathing “gentleness and care into the harsh progress of mankind.” Also borrowing from nature is landscape architect Tom Stuart-Smith, whose proposal incorporates a replica of a centuries-old oak tree from Windsor Great Park, once the private hunting grounds of the late Queen’s former residence, Windsor Castle. Stuart-Smith’s team would digitally scan the tree before casting it as a full-size bronze sculpture. Called “The Queen’s Oak” and situated beside a gently curved bridge, the sculpture would be the centerpiece of the site, its lacquered leaves appearing like a “golden mirage reflected in the lake” at night, according to the firm’s entry. Other features include bronze casts of flowers from various Commonwealth countries, as well as a “sonic soundscape” playing recorded memories from people whose lives were impacted by Elizabeth II. To create a contemplative experience, architecture firm WilkinsonEyre, which recently restored London’s Battersea Power Station, proposed pathways with “threads” symbolizing the Queen’s life. Visitors can follow each of the threads, which are built around seven themes, including family, nature and the Commonwealth, representing her seven decades of service. A pair of bridges, set on two different levels, would give visitors views of the park, royal palaces and the London skyline.",

    "content": "There is something peculiar about entering a building only to be greeted by another one inside it, so it takes a moment to adjust upon arriving on the second floor of London’s prestigious Tate Modern art gallery. Directly in front of the entryway is a 1:1 scale facsimile of Do Ho Suh’s childhood home in Seoul, which he wrapped in mulberry paper and carefully traced in graphite to produce an intricate rubbing of the exterior. It is just one of many versions of home envisioned by the Korean artist over the past 30 years. Running at Tate Modern through to October, “Walk the House” is Suh’s largest solo institutional show to date in the UK, where he has been based since 2016. Before that, he lived in the US, having studied at the Rhode Island School of Design and Yale University in the 1990s. The exhibition’s name stems from an expression used in the context of the “ ,” a traditional Korean house that can be taken down and reassembled elsewhere, thanks to its construction and lightweight materials. The buildings have become rarer over time, because of urbanization, war and occupation, which led to the destruction of many traditional homes in the country. Suh’s own childhood home was an outlier amid Seoul’s changing cityscape during the 1970s, which underwent rapid development after  the Korean War left the city in ruins. It spurred the artist’s ongoing preoccupations with home as both a physical space that could be dissolved and reanimated, but also a psychological construct that can reflect memory and identity. Among the show’s exhibits are embroidered artworks, architectural models in various materials and scales, and film works involving complex 3D techniques. The detailed outlines picked up in Suh’s hanok rubbing are echoed in two closely related large-scale pieces on display for the first time, both of which visitors can walk inside. “Perfect Home: London, Horsham, New York, Berlin, Providence, Seoul” (2024) takes various 3D fixtures and fittings from homes Suh has lived in around the world and maps them onto a tent-like model of his London apartment. “Nest/s” (2024) is a pastel-hued tunnel, again based on different places he has called home, this time splicing together incongruous hallways — an environment that holds symbolic meaning for the artist. “I think that the experience of cultural displacement helped me to see these in-between spaces, the space that connects places. That journey lets me focus on transitional spaces, like corridors, staircases, entrances,” Suh told CNN at the show’s opening. The exhibition also features “Staircase” (2016), a 3D structure that was subsequently collapsed into a red, sinewy 2D tangle. “I think in general we tend to focus on destinations, but these bridges that connect those destinations, often we neglect them, but actually we spend most of our time in this transitional stage,” Suh said. There’s a translucent quality to much of the work on display. Fine, gauzy textiles are used directly within many of the pieces, as well as in the form of a subtle room divider — the closest thing to an internal wall in the main space. “For the first time since 2016, the galleries of the exhibition will have all their walls taken down in order to accommodate the multiple large-scale works that will be materialized within them, as well as the multiple times and spaces that those works carry,” said Dina Akhmadeeva, assistant curator for international art at Tate Modern, who co-curated the show with Nabila Abdel Nabi, senior curator of international art at the Hyundai Tate Research Centre: Transnational. “In doing so, the open layout will form not a linear passage or narrative, but instead encourage visitors to meander, return, loop back, evoking an experience closer to the function of memory itself.” Suh’s emphasis on spatial interventions poses creative challenges for curators as well as the institutions that hold these works. One such example is “Staircase-III” (2010), acquired by the Tate back in 2011, which often needs to be adapted to wherever it is shown by measuring new panels to fit each space. “I wanted to disturb the habitual experience of (encountering) an artwork in a museum,” said Suh by way of explanation. Akhmadeeva added that the approach challenged the “idea of permanence — of the work and of the space around it.” Removing the gallery walls also reflects Suh’s interest in peeling environments back to their foundations. “It’s just the bare space that the architects originally conceived,” he said. Suh’s work often focuses on spatial experiences rather than material goods because, just like the rooms and buildings we inhabit, an empty space behaves like a “vessel” for memories, he explained. “Over the years and the time that you’ve spent in the space, you project your own experience and energy onto it, and then it becomes a memory.” The artist does occasionally focus on ornaments and furnishings, however, as seen in his monumental film, “Robin Hood Gardens” (named after the East London housing estate it captures), which used photogrammetry to stitch together drone footage taken inside the council building awaiting demolition. It marked a rare instance of Suh documenting both residents and their belongings. The film illustrates the subtle politics of Suh’s practice. “Often in my case, the color and the craftsmanship and the beauty in my work distract from the political undertone of it,” he said. Issues such as privacy, security, and access to space are intimately connected to class and public policy, but his commentary is covered in a soft veil of fabric or the gentle rub of graphite. The latter is also used in “Rubbing/Loving: Company Housing of Gwangju Theater” (2012), which reflects on the deadly Gwangju Uprising of 1980. The artwork resembles the shell of a room that is unravelled to form a flat, vertical structure, like a deconstructed box. It is based on a rubbing that was taken by Suh and his assistants while blindfolded — a nod to the censorship of the military’s violent response  and its absence from South Korean collective memory. The exhibition is bookended by pieces that address sociopolitical questions. “Bridge Project” (1999) explores land ownership among other issues, while “Public Figures” (2025), an evolution of a piece Suh made for the Venice Biennale in 2001, is a subverted monument featuring an empty plinth, directing focus to the many miniature figurines upholding it. For Suh, it was intended to address Korea’s histories of both oppression and resilience. While these two exhibits may feel distinct, for Suh, all of his work interrogates the boundaries between personal and public space, and the conditions that force transience or enable permanence. The tension between public and private was thrown into sharp relief during the pandemic, when lockdowns forced people to spend most of their time indoors. Although Suh “scrutinized” all corners of his home during this time, the lockdowns didn’t materialize in his practice in the way one might expect. Instead, it elicited a more tender reflection on what is often the making of a home: people. It explains why, among the substantial, often colorful structures in the exhibition, there are two small tunics made for (and with) his two young daughters, adorned with pockets holding their most cherished belongings, such as crayons and toys. “As a parent, it was quite a vulnerable situation. Other families, I cannot speak for them, but it really helped us to be together,” said Suh.",

    "content": "The official coronation portrait of Britain’s King Charles was made public on Tuesday, two years after he was crowned, in a tradition dating back more than 400 years to a time when such a painting often became the defining image of a monarch. The portrait of Charles, in his Robe of State standing beside the Imperial State Crown, and one of his wife, Queen Camilla, will go on display in London’s National Gallery for a month before being moved to Buckingham Palace, their permanent home, Buckingham Palace said in a statement on Tuesday. Charles, 76, who was diagnosed with an unspecified form of cancer early last year some 10 months after his coronation, has been sitting for the portrait while he undergoes treatment. The king and queen commissioned the paintings shortly after the coronation ceremony at London’s Westminster Abbey, choosing different artists. Charles was painted by Peter Kuhfeld, while Camilla selected Paul Benney, Buckingham Palace said. “I have tried to produce a painting that is both human and regal, continuing the tradition of royal portraiture,” Kuhfeld said in a statement of the image of the king whose backdrop is the Throne Room in St James’s Palace. Camilla is seen wearing her Coronation Dress of ivory colored silk, next to a different crown. Benney said he wanted to acknowledge the historic nature of the coronation while also showing “the humanity and empathy of such an extraordinary person taking on an extraordinary role.” Historically, the paintings were used as a show of power. The earliest example in the royal collection is the state portrait of James I of England, James VI of Scotland, from 1620.",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: This article was originally published by , an editorial partner of CNN Style. The curator Koyo Kouoh, a giant of the contemporary art world who tirelessly championed African artists and became the first woman from the continent to , died on Saturday, age 57. Her death, in a hospital in Basel, Switzerland, was announced in a statement by the Biennale. While the official cause was not disclosed, her husband, Philippe Mall, said she had died of cancer following a recent diagnosis, according to . Kouoh had been appointed in December to curate the next edition of the Biennale, the world’s most prestigious international art exhibition. In its statement, the organization said: “Koyo Kouoh worked with passion, intellectual rigour and vision on the conception and development of the Biennale Arte 2026. The presentation of the exhibition’s title and theme was due to take place in Venice on May 20.” It added: “Her passing leaves an immense void in the world of contemporary art and in the international community of artists, curators and scholars who had the privilege of knowing and admiring her extraordinary human and intellectual commitment.” Giorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, in a statement: “I express my deep condolences for the untimely and sudden death of Koyo Kouoh.” Asked how her death might affect the next Biennale, a spokesperson told The Art Newspaper: “We’ll know on May 20.” The spokesperson clarified that the conference was still scheduled to take place on that date. The Biennale is scheduled to run from May 9 to November 22, 2026. The organization had cast Kouoh’s appointment as reinforcing its cutting-edge reputation. In December, Pietrangelo Buttafuoco, the Biennale’s president, praised her “refined, young, and disruptive intelligence” in a press statement. In the same announcement, Kouoh called her appointment a “once-in-a-lifetime honor and privilege,” describing the Biennale as “the center of gravity for art for over a century.” She expressed hope that her exhibition would “carry meaning for the world we currently live in — and most importantly, for the world we want to make.” Kouoh was born in Douala, Cameroon, in 1967, and moved to Switzerland at 13. After studying administration and banking, she worked as a social worker assisting migrant women before immersing herself in the art world and returning to Africa in 1996. In Dakar, Senegal, she founded RAW Material Company, an independent art center. In 2016, she joined the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa (Zeitz MOCAA) in Cape Town, serving as curator and There, she became a leading advocate for Black artists from Africa and beyond, curating, among other projects, a major retrospective of the South African artist Tracey Rose in 2022. Beyond Africa, she won acclaim for exhibitions such as “Body Talk: Feminism, Sexuality and the Body in the Works of Six African Women Artists,” which opened at WIELS Contemporary Art Centre in Brussels in 2015, and “Still (the) Barbarians” at the 2016 Ireland Biennial in Limerick, which explored Ireland’s postcolonial condition in the context of the 1916 Easter Rising centenary. “Kouoh did not leave a title for the Biennale, but she did leave a grammar: the urgency to rewrite the rules of the curatorial game,” wrote an Italian art magazine, in its obituary. “Koyo Kouoh’s theoretical legacy… does not propose new aesthetic models to frame, but undermines the very foundations of cultural hierarchy. It does not offer easy solutions, but asks uncomfortable questions: Who decides what is ‘art’? Who has the right to tell? What is left to say when language itself has been historically colonized?” .",

    "title": "\n      Who took ‘Napalm Girl’? World Press Photo ‘suspends’ attribution of historic Vietnam War image\n    ",

    "publication_date": "2025-05-19T12:38:07.150Z",

    "content": "World Press Photo has cast fresh doubt over the authorship of “The Terror of War,” a picture better known as “Napalm Girl,” amid growing debate about one of the 20th century’s defining images. The organization, which named the image “Photo of the Year” in 1973, Friday that it has “suspended” its longstanding attribution to retired Associated Press (AP) photographer Nick Ut. An said the “visual and technical” evidence “leans toward” an emerging theory that a Vietnamese freelance photographer, Nguyen Thanh Nghe, took the photo. It is the latest twist in a controversy sparked by “The Stringer,” a documentary that premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January claiming Nghe, not Ut, captured the iconic photo of a naked girl fleeing a napalm attack during the Vietnam War. Nghe was one of more than a dozen people stationed at a highway checkpoint outside the village of Trang Bang on June 8, 1972, as 9-year-old Phan Thi Kim Phuc and other villagers were mistaken for the enemy and bombarded by the South Vietnamese air force. (A year later, Ut won the Pulitzer Prize for the picture.) The film contains allegations that Nghe sold his photo to the AP before editors intervened to credit Ut, who was the agency’s staff photographer in Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) at the time. CNN could not independently assess the claims because the film’s producer, the VII Foundation, did not respond to multiple requests for a copy of the documentary, which has not yet been publicly released. Ut has since repeatedly dismissed allegations that he did not take the photo. A statement released on the Vietnamese American photographer’s behalf by his attorney, Jim Hornstein, called World Press Photo’s decision to suspend attribution “deplorable and unprofessional.” The statement added that Nghe’s claim is “unsupported by a scintilla of corroborating evidence or eyewitness.” Earlier this month, the AP published a on the matter. The investigation — which was based on eyewitness interviews, examination of cameras, a 3D model of the scene and surviving photo negatives — found “no definitive evidence” to justify changing the attribution. While the agency acknowledged that the passage of time and absence of key evidence made it “impossible to fully prove” whether Ut took the photo, crediting Nghe would “require several leaps of faith.” But World Press Photo took a different stance, with executive director Joumana El Zein Khoury writing on the organization’s website that the “level of doubt is too significant to maintain the existing attribution.” “At the same time, lacking conclusive evidence pointing definitively to another photographer, we cannot reassign authorship either,” she continued, adding: “The suspension will remain in place unless further evidence can clearly confirm or refute the original authorship.” Citing the AP investigation and the documentary, which included visual analysis by Paris-based research group Index, World Press Photo said there are “substantial and credible reasons” to doubt the existing attribution. The organization’s report centers on several “unresolved issues,” including the camera used to take the photo and analyses of Ut’s position relative to the image’s vantage point. A reconstruction of the scene by Index, based on a “geo-based timeline,” suggested that Ut would have needed to have “taken the photo, run 60 meters (197 feet), and returned calmly, all within a brief window of time,” World Press Photo said. The organization described that scenario as “highly unlikely” though “not impossible.” The AP, meanwhile, has disputed the 60-meter figure, saying that Ut’s purported position on the highway — which is based on “shaky,” low-resolution footage filmed by a TV cameraman — could have been as little as 32.8 meters away from where the image was captured, and that the photographer “could have been in the position to have taken the shot.” World Press Photo also pointed to ongoing questions over equipment. The AP has previously said it is “likely” the photo was taken using a Pentax camera, which Nghe is known to have used. Ut, however, had frequently said he carried cameras by Leica and Nikon. When questioned for the AP’s investigation, Ut told the agency he also used Pentax cameras. The photo agency said it subsequently found negatives in its archives, shot by Ut in Vietnam, with “the characteristics of a Pentax camera.” World Press Photo also noted the possibility that another person altogether — Vietnamese military photographer Huynh Cong Phuc, who sometimes sold images to news agencies — took the photo. The AP’s investigation noted that he, like Ut and Nghe, “could have been in the position to have taken the shot.” Earlier this month, Ut welcomed the findings of the AP’s latest report, saying in a statement that it “showed what has always been known, that the credit for my photo … is correct.” He added: “This whole thing has been very difficult for me and has caused great pain.” Appearing in the world’s newspapers the day after it was taken, “The Terror of War” became a symbol of opposition to the Vietnam War. In the decades since, Ut has campaigned for peace alongside the photo’s subject, now known as Kim Phuc Phan Thi, who survived her injuries and was granted political asylum by Canada in 1992. to mark the image’s 50th anniversary in 2022, the photographer recounted his version of events, saying: “I saw Kim running and she (screamed in Vietnamese) ‘Too hot! Too hot!’ “When I took the photo of her, I saw that her body was burned so badly, and I wanted to help her right away. I put all my camera gear down on the highway and put water on her body.” Ut said he put the injured children in his van and drove them for 30 minutes to a nearby hospital. “When I went back to my office, the (dark room technician) and everyone who saw the picture told me right away it was very powerful, and that the photo would win a Pulitzer,” he added. In a statement emailed to CNN, the organizer of the Pulitzer Prizes said it “does not anticipate future action” regarding Ut’s award. “The Pulitzer Prizes depend on submitting news organizations to determine the authorship of their entries,” the statement read. “AP’s extensive review showed insufficient proof to withdraw credit.” This article was updated to include a statement from Pulitzer Prize organizers.",

    "content": "A sculpture of the late American singer and poet Jim Morrison that went missing from his gravesite in almost four decades ago has been found, according to French police. “After 37 years of absence, the bust of Jim Morrison, stolen in 1988 from the Père Lachaise cemetery, has been found,” wrote the Paris Regional Judicial Police Directorate in an Instagram on Friday. It added that “this iconic symbol for the singer’s fans was recovered” during an investigation conducted by the Financial and Anti-Corruption Brigade, under the authority of the Paris Public Prosecutor’s Office. “This was a chance discovery made during a search ordered by an examining magistrate at the Paris court,” the prosecutor’s office told CNN in a statement Tuesday. Jeff Jampol, manager of the Jim Morrison Estate, told CNN in a statement Tuesday that they were “happy to hear” of the statue’s rediscovery, adding: “Obviously it’s a piece of history, and one Jim’s family wanted there on his grave, so it’s gratifying to see that it’s been recovered.” “Now we’ll have to see what kind of shape the bust is in,” he continued. Morrison, the charismatic frontman of 1960s psychedelic rock band The Doors, died in 1971, aged just 27. His grave in the French capital attracts many music fans. Resting in the Père Lachaise cemetery, it is one of the most popular graves in Paris, according to the city’s official tourism , with crowds gathering there on the anniversary of his death on July 3 every year. The bust, created by Croatian sculptor Mladen Mikulin, was installed on his tombstone on the 10th anniversary of his death, according to the official city of Paris . However, it disappeared in 1988. The grave’s headstone, which was damaged in the 1980s, was replaced by his parents in 1990 with the epitaph “True to His Spirit” written on it in Greek. On the 20th in 1991, police had to disperse fans from the cemetery with tear gas due to unruly behaviour. By the 30th anniversary, alcohol and music had been banned, but thousands still turned up to his plot to lay wreaths and take photos. “Every day, somewhere in the world, a Doors song is played,” said former Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek at the time. “The energy of Jim Morrison is still with us, in the ether.” Morrison, who was also known as “The Lizard King,” developed a reputation for his heavy alcohol drinking and shocking onstage antics. Morrison left the band in 1971 to focus on writing poetry and he moved to Paris with his girlfriend, Pamela Courson. However, he died in their Paris apartment later that year. Courson told authorities that she had found the singer dead in the bathtub. His cause of death is officially recorded as being heart failure but no autopsy was conducted, prompting conspiracy theories. CNN’s Jack Guy contributed reporting.",

    "content": "Indian author Banu Mushtaq and translator Deepa Bhasthi won the International Booker Prize for fiction Tuesday for “Heart Lamp,” a collection of 12 short stories written over a period of more than 30 years and which chronicle the everyday lives and struggles of women in southern India. The award was announced by bestselling Booker Prize-longlisted author Max Porter in his role as chair of the five-member voting panel, at a ceremony at London’s Tate Modern. It is the first time the award has been given to a collection of short stories. Bhasthi is the first Indian translator — and ninth female translator — to win the prize since it took on its current form in 2016. Mushtaq is the sixth female author to be awarded the prize since then. Written in Kannada, which is spoken by around 65 million people, primarily in southern India, Porter praised the “radical” nature of the translation, adding that “It’s been a joy” to listen to the evolving appreciation of the stories by members of the jury. “These beautiful, busy, life-affirming stories rise from Kannada, interspersed with the extraordinary socio-political richness of other languages and dialects,” said Porter. ”It speaks of women’s lives, reproductive rights, faith, caste, power and oppression.” The book, which beat five other finalists, comprises stories written from 1990 to 2023. They were selected and curated by Bhasthi, who was keen to preserve the multilingual nature of southern India in her translation. Mushtaq, who is a lawyer and activist as well as writer, told a short list reading event on Sunday that the stories “are about women – how religion, society and politics demand unquestioning obedience from them, and in doing so, inflict inhumane cruelty upon them, turning them into mere subordinates.” The 50,000-pound ($66,000) prize money is to be divided equally between author and translator. Each is presented with a trophy too. The International Booker Prize is awarded every year. It is run alongside the Booker Prize for English-language fiction, which will be handed out in the fall.",

    "content": "A monument to dictator erected in subway is stirring debate, with some Russians welcoming it as a historical tribute, but others saying it’s a mistake to commemorate someone who presided over so much suffering. The life-size wall sculpture in Moscow’s Taganskaya metro station depicts Stalin standing on Moscow’s Red Square surrounded by a crowd of Soviet citizens looking at him in admiration, and is a recreation of a monument that was unveiled in the same station in 1950, three years before Stalin died. The Moscow metro said that the original monument to Stalin had been “lost” in 1966 when the Taganskaya metro station hosting it had been reconfigured. Nearly 700,000 people were executed in Stalin’s 1937-38 Great Terror amid show trials and purges of his real and perceived enemies. Many other Soviet citizens were sent to the gulag, a grim network of prison camps, spread across the world’s largest country. The Moscow metro said in a statement that the new version of the monument, which was presented to the public on May 15, was one of its “gifts” to passengers to mark the 90th anniversary of the sprawling, ornate and famously efficient transportation system. The work’s original title, “Gratitude of the People to the Leader and Commander,” was dedicated to Stalin’s role in delivering victory for the Soviet Union in World War II, the 80th anniversary of which Russia . “This man (Stalin), he created a lot,” said Yevgeny Ivanov, a Moscow resident, who had come to look at the new monument on Wednesday. “He has something to be proud of. And it is not for us to tear it down. A man did something - we must respect what he did.” Kirill Frolov, another resident of the capital, said he accepted that Stalin’s record was mixed and that you couldn’t call him “good.” But he said that Stalin’s role as a victor in World War II and his successful industrialization of the Soviet Union meant he had achieved real results and deserved to be remembered. “This man did more for our country than anyone else. That’s why I think that this (the new monument) is good and there should be more… Because the generation of, say, the 2000s and later, they don’t really understand at all who this is.” Others condemned the monument. The Moscow branch of the liberal Yabloko party issued a formal protest against what it called the return of a monument to “a tyrant and a dictator” and demanded that the Moscow metro focus on commemorating the victims of Stalin’s repressions instead. “The return of symbols of Stalinism to Moscow is spitting in the face of history and an act of mockery against the descendants of the repressed,” Yabloko said in a statement. Unidentified individuals initially left two signs at the monument containing quotes from Russian President Vladimir Putin and former President Dmitry Medvedev that were critical of Stalin. They were later removed. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin for his brutality and crimes in 1956 and images of Stalin would later be systematically removed as part of a de-Stalinization campaign. In recent years, some monuments to Stalin have begun to reappear in some places, though his legacy remains deeply divisive. Alexander Zinoviev, a researcher and expert on Soviet architecture, said he felt the new monument and the period it evoked had some parallels with the current mood inside Russia at a time when it is locked in a standoff with the West over the war in Ukraine. “It is the same self-isolation, it is the same conservative ideology and reliance on our own strength,” he said. “And this theme with Stalin, with his esthetics…that we need to trust our leader and be happy and not criticize those in power, it is very in tune with our time.”",

    "content": "Photographer Derek Ridgers’ introduction to the Cannes Film Festival arrived in 1984, when he was commissioned to shoot the DJ and rapper Afrika Bambaataa — in town to promote his cameo in Stan Lathan’s “Beat Street” — for the music magazine, NME. “I don’t think I’d ever really thought about Cannes, or the film festival, before I went,” Ridgers, widely celebrated for his distinctive portraits of British subcultures, told CNN via email. “Every year one sees items about it on TV, but it hadn’t impacted my life in any significant way.” Ridgers would return to the French resort town a further 11 times, during which he said he “only ever saw two films” — “Beat Street” and Thaddeus O’Sullivan’s “December Bride” (he’d been at art school with the director). “If you’re on the French Riviera and the sun’s out, why would you choose to go to the cinema if you didn’t have to?” he reasoned. Instead, Ridgers focused on the compelling and sometimes controversial scenes that unfolded around him, shooting celebrities, young models and upcoming actresses, as well as fellow photographers. Three decades on, some 80 images from Ridgers’ archive have been brought together in a new book, published by IDEA. The festival it presents is in many ways a different kind of spectacle to its contemporary iteration. This year’s edition, which runs through May 24, will largely be experienced via social media (the official Festival de Cannes Instagram page has 1.3 million followers alone, while thousands of tagged videos populate TikTok). In Ridgers’ pictures, made in the 1980s and 1990s, there’s not a single cell phone and barely a point and shoot camera; star-making-moments, political statements and fashion history were all typically reported by TV and printed media. “My interest has always been people and, I suppose, a study of the human condition,” said Ridgers, who, alongside his professional assignments, spent much of the 1980s and the decade prior documenting London’s punks, skinheads and New Romantics. “The film festival was my first extended foray into reportage, but it’s still all people doing what people do,” he noted, reflecting on how his book “Cannes” was shaped by this same curiosity, in tandem with his rejection of the more traditional red carpet set-up. “There’s so much of life’s rich pageant on show during Cannes, there are great photographic opportunities almost everywhere,” he continued. Shooting both in color and black and white, Ridgers captured icons such as Clint Eastwood, Helmut Newton and John Waters, as well as then-up and coming models like Frankie Rayder, who appears on the book’s cover dressed in diamonds and fur (the surrounding crowd adopting casual jeans and T-shirts), and performers attending the Hot D’Or adult film industry awards too, including the late Lolo Ferrari. “During the years I was going, the film festival seemed to become a bigger and bigger deal,” shared Ridgers. “When the porn stars were having their awards show there as well (the Hot D’Or’s ran from 1992-2001), that added a layer of craziness and made for some interesting photographic juxtapositions. The main film festival seemed to take itself awfully serious, and having the porn stars there lightened the mood somewhat.” Young women then, adult entertainers and wannabe film stars alike, are a constant throughout the new book, posing with friends or performing for the camera; showing off in an attempt to emulate Brigitte Bardot’s culture-shifting debut at the festival in 1953, while promoting “Manina, the Girl in the Bikini.” Ridgers, adopting the gaze of a bystander, recorded it all, from the playful to the outrageous, and sometimes the outright questionable, as in the picture of another photographer taking an upskirting shot. “It seemed shocking then, too, which was why I took the photograph,” he explained. “I was appalled by the unabashed brazenness of it. Someone doing that nowadays would, rightly, get arrested.” Stressing that he never considered himself above his peers, Ridgers further recalled that he also never felt any sense of kinship with them, and the book concludes with an image of some photographers holding and discussing one of his images, oblivious to his presence. “The whole time I went to the festival, I don’t think I had one conversation with any of the other photographers,” he said. “They shouted at me occasionally, for getting in their way, but that’s hardly a conversation. It sounds terrible, I know, but I just ignored them. I’m competitive and very focused — if I’m standing around chatting, I may be missing a good photograph.” In “Cannes” however, the mood is one of debauchery with a light-hearted sensibility. “I’m serious about my work but this is not a particularly serious photobook,” said Ridgers, acknowledging the nature of its contents. “Most of the photographs are frivolous, and some are simply outrageous. These days, because of the French law of (a right to one’s image) it’s harder to publish photographs of people in public without their permission — how that works in the era of the camera phone, I have no idea. My photographs are testament to what fun, crazy and at times, ludicrous, things happened back then.”",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days. The American Music Awards returned after a two-year hiatus to a new location in Las Vegas, and while several celebrities seemed to take style inspiration from Sin City, none took the brief more seriously (or unseriously) than Rebecca Black, who stepped onto the red carpet dressed for a shotgun wedding. Black’s ivory silk taffeta dress was flouncy and corseted, and she paired it with a bridal veil and monogrammed sailor hat — the latter accessory a signature of the LA designer Erik Charlotte’s maritime-influenced fall 2024 capsule collection. When asked by Variety if she said she wanted a wedding gown, Black joked: “I did not, but then we ended up here, and I said of course I’m getting married.” At another point, she told Billboard she wanted to look like “an angel,” adding, “I wanted to float down the carpet.” Black, who rose to fame in 2011 as a teen for her viral pop song “Friday,” has pivoted in adulthood to hyperpop and Boiler Room-approved DJ sets, opening for Katy Perry and striking out on her own tours, too. She’s been candid about how her early fame negatively impacted her mental health, telling Good Morning America in 2020 she became “ ” due to online bullying over her song. Over the past few years, as she’s an openly queer identity, her return to music has been more tongue-in-cheek with campy, party-girl aesthetics that have gained her a new cult following. At the AMAs, she told Billboard she’s “taking it one day at a time. I have a lot of fun with what I do obviously,” she added, gesturing to her look. Black’s ensemble stood out during an unusually subdued red carpet, with many celebrities skipping the step-and-repeat — or the event altogether. The night paid tribute to icons including Janet Jackson and Gloria Estefan, but a number of nominated and winning artists sent recorded messages in lieu of attending. Out of those who did arrive, some, like Black, leaned into the Vegas look, though overall the night’s fashion was disjointed. As the event’s host, Jennifer Lopez had multiple glittering and voluminous outfit changes fit for location, while Benson Boone performed in a bold purple floral suit by Dolce & Gabbana and Shaboozey donned bedazzled plaid chaps by Etro. Ciara arrived in a showgirl-esque Bronx and Banco bodysuit dripping in chains — acknowledging to Billboard that “we gotta bring bling bling to Vegas” in a red-carpet interview, while Heidi Montag glittered in a blue flared jumpsuit by The Blonds. Though Black might not be rushing off to Vegas’s wedding chapels, bridal looks have a long history of closing out runways. And as the event’s official closer — the AMAs’ afterparty DJ — her irreverent look fit the bill.",

    "content": "In Caroline Walker’s 2022 painting “Bottles and Pumps”, various breastfeeding paraphernalia lies drying on a white tray. “That’s been an interesting one, in terms of how people have responded,” she wrote to CNN over email, relaying the painting’s reception as part of “Acts of Creation: On Art and Motherhood”, a touring group show curated by art critic Hettie Judah. “It was the painting men responded to most when it was first shown (at Stephen Friedman Gallery in London), with (their) memories of bottle feeds or being tasked with cleaning and sterilizing the apparatus in those strange first months with a new baby,” said Walker. The work was initially produced as part of “Lisa”, a series of paintings capturing Walker’s sister-in-law in the weeks immediately before, and three months after, giving birth. At The Hepworth Wakefield gallery in the north of England, pieces from “Lisa” join other artworks by the Scottish artist in a major new solo show, titled “Mothering,” in an intimate survey of early motherhood and the extended support network that helps new mothers navigate the experience — from midwives and cleaners, to grandmothers and childcare workers. The show includes work made during Walker’s 2021 artist’s residency at a London hospital maternity ward (“Birth Reflections”) and depicting her young daughter’s nursery (“Nurture”). “’Mothering’ felt like an expansive title that could describe acts of care, which weren’t limited to the relationship between biological mother and child, reflecting the wide range of people who become part of our lives in the early years of childhood,” shared Walker, reflecting on the deliberate reframing of how motherhood is characterized and tethering it to the socio-economic structures of labor she has previously studied. “I liked that the term is a verb describing the act of providing care and nurture, rather than a specific identity or fixed relationship.” The theme of motherhood has been a core focus for artists for centuries, though it is often with men in the role of the author, rendering scenes they only know secondhand. See Gustav Klimt’s “The Three Ages of Women”, or Caravaggio’s controversial “Madonna and Child with St. Anne (Dei Palafrenieri)” — indeed, the many depictions of the Madonna and Child make it perhaps the most widely celebrated and frequently circulated image in the genre of mother and children in art. For Walker however, it wasn’t always an obvious subject matter. “Motherhood wasn’t a preoccupation for me, so I wasn’t looking for it in the world around me,” she said. “I’ve always been drawn to images of women in painting. Some of course were depictions of motherhood, but it wasn’t something I was especially drawn to.” “My work is very routed in a Western painting tradition and frequently references, directly and indirectly, specific genres,” Walker continued, “but I try to approach these through a contemporary female lens, asking if the perspective of a woman artist can add something different.” In Walker’s own research, she found a sense of commonality in the work of Impressionist painters Mary Cassatt and Berthe Morisot; “The Wet Nurse Angele Feeding Julie Manet”, made by Morisot in 1880, in particular shares a dialogue with her own perspective. “The relationship of exchange that’s at play in the painting really interests me. Morisot is paying another woman to nurture her child, so she can work and make that exchange the subject of the work itself,” Walker explained, referencing the balancing act that has commonly been an obstacle for women who are parents, especially working-class individuals and those from marginalized communities, generally and also within creative industries, where income is typically less stable. “I’ve been thinking a lot about the relationship between paid and unpaid care and the transactional nature of nurseries and paid childcare, a service we rely on as a society and which I myself utilize.” “Mothering” then, in title and content, stretches the typical narrative and asks the viewer to revise how we might imagine motherhood to be presented creatively, building on the vast visual library constructed by women artists over the last century. Louise Bourgeois for example, whose “Maman” sculpture recently returned to London’s Tate Modern, frequently interrogated ideas about motherhood and maternity in her work, while Alice Neel often painted mothers and their children informed, in some part, by her own understanding of the relationship (in an early piece from 1930, she fused her own story with the Virgin Mary’s, producing “Degenerate Madonna”). In photography too, these roles and the associated rituals have regularly been a vehicle for expression, from Carrie Mae Weems’s “Kitchen Table Series”, featuring a mother and daughter make-up session, to Rineke Dijkstra’s “New Mothers”, wherein the photographer documented women and their hours-old newborns. In 2020, the American photographer Maggie Shannon began accompanying midwives on home visits for what would become “Extreme Pain, Extreme Joy”, an echo of Walker’s hospital residency. And in 2023, Andi Galdi Vinko’s “Sorry I Gave Birth I Disappeared But Now I’m Back”, a confronting but ultimately warm account of the first years of motherhood, won the UK’s Kraszna-Krausz Foundation Photography Book Award. While hardly a new arena, in 2025 it seems there is a considerable effort, as part of a wider campaign of awareness and correction, to foreground these artists, just as women artists more broadly have begun to receive their flowers. The volume of interest in Walker’s work is a prime example of this. In addition to “Mothering”, her paintings are currently on display in three group shows: the Scottish leg of “Acts of Creation” at Dundee Contemporary Arts, “Good Mom/Bad Mom” at Centraal Museum in Utrecht, and at Dussedorf’s Kunstpalast in “MAMA: From Mary to Merkel”. I liked that the term is a verb describing the act of providing care and nurture, rather than a specific identity or fixed relationship. Artist Caroline Walker In “Mothering: The Family Reborn”, the closing chapter of a Thames & Hudson publication that accompanies Judah’s “Acts of Creation” exhibition, the critic celebrates the notion of mothering as perceived by queer artists, oftentimes in a political context, exploring how “committing to networks of care” and a broader sense of shared responsibility has previously been, and has the potential to, further comprise modern iterations of motherhood. Here, she references artists such as Sadie Lune, Zanele Muholi and Cathy Cade. In Walker’s case, the term mothering arrived via a member of the team at her daughter’s nursery, who explained that it was a key part of their training. Subsequently, Walker said she began reflecting on “the constellation of women that are part of my children’s care and education, performing vital work and informing a period of a child’s life, which research has shown is important to their development throughout childhood and beyond.” “I had been exploring the subject of women’s working lives for a few years but becoming a mother really opened my eyes to this whole area of women’s labor in relation to the bearing and rearing of children,” Walker continued. “Women artists have been responding to the demands of motherhood for decades but haven’t always enjoyed the same exposure or validation. If I was making this work 10 years ago, I don’t think it would be getting so much traction.”",

    "content": "Many people will have experienced the excitement of receiving an online order, or that hit of dopamine that follows a new purchase. But what happens when you unbox the goods, only to find that it wasn’t what you were expecting? Worse yet, when it turns out that you spent a significant sum on a product that could potentially be counterfeit? That was the dilemma Joan Kim had to contend with. In a TikTok uploaded in December 2024 that has since amassed over 1 million views, the Los Angeles-based content creator shared her frustration at “being scammed” by US luxury department store-chain Saks Fifth Avenue. “It’s the holidays and I wanted to buy a gift,” Kim said, gesturing to an ivory-colored leather bag on her shoulder. Priced at $2,600, it was a tote by The Row, the discreet, logo-free luxury label founded by actresses-turned-designers Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. “I’ve been needing a bag and I wanted one that wasn’t so ‘loud,’” Kim told CNN over email. (As) I already had The Row bag in medium, I wanted to buy the bigger size in black.” And while she was initially delighted to receive her order, made online through Saks Fifth Avenue (a receipt of the purchase was viewed by CNN), that joy quickly faded as she noticed discrepancies between her new purchase and the same style she already owned. Kim said that the dust bag it arrived in was a different color and fabric, its drawstring visibly thicker. The stitched-on rectangular logo, bearing the brand’s name, also looked dissimilar. “I had a feeling it was off,” said Kim, adding that when she opened the dust bag, what she found inside “was even weirder.” Looking at her cream bag, which she had purchased directly from The Row’s Melrose Place store, and the black version that had arrived from Saks, she observed multiple differences — from the material used in the lining to its shape when worn. Convinced that the new bag was a fake, Kim was deeply disappointed. After all, Saks Global, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue as well as luxury stores Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus, is a respected entity, known for selling high-end brands including Prada, Gucci and Dolce & Gabbana. She contacted Saks’ customer service department, which asked her to return the product via post. But Kim wasn’t satisfied with the response. Her concern, she explained, was that she would have no physical evidence to prove her claim — and that she consequently wouldn’t receive a refund — if she wasn’t believed. Ultimately, Kim took the bag to a Saks Fifth Avenue store in Beverly Hills and received a refund in gift card form, but the experience had left a sour taste in her mouth. “After the incident, I haven’t purchased anything online,” she told CNN, adding that in the future she would only shop for luxury goods in-person. Saks confirmed to CNN that the incident had been resolved, but did not comment on whether the returned bag was counterfeit and what had happened to it. “Return fraud has become a pervasive issue for retailers, and, as a result, we consistently evaluate our returns approach,” a global spokesperson for Saks said in an emailed statement. “As part of this, we’ve identified the need to take additional steps in our processes, including more time for careful product quality inspection and authentication, to ensure that customers receive high quality authentic merchandise in future orders.” The spokesperson added: “Our fulfillment centers manage millions of shipments every year, but it is unacceptable for any customer to have this experience. Our top priority is ensuring our customers enjoy the luxury shopping experience for which Saks Fifth Avenue is known, and we continuously work to improve our processes.” Kim’s experience isn’t as unusual as you might think, with shoppers across the world reporting similar incidents. Tiffany Kim (no relation), a California-based dental hygienist, was also shocked to discover that a recent purchase — a top-handle bag, also by The Row — could potentially be counterfeit. She had bought it from Ssense, a Canadian online luxury retailer that stocks Bottega Veneta, Loewe and Auralee, among other fashionable labels. When Kim received the bag in January, she had her suspicions, because the quality didn’t match her expectations. She ended up purchasing the same style directly from The Row. On placing the two bags side-by-side, they appeared distinctively different in size, shape and material. The product that had arrived from Ssense was also missing a warranty card. Kim was astonished. “This bag is not cheap; it’s about $1,000,” she said shared with her 39,900 followers on Instagram. Kim did not respond to requests for comment from CNN. On her video alleging that she received a fake product, Ssense commented that it had gotten in touch directly in hopes of resolving the issue. In a statement provided to CNN, Ssense did not comment on whether the bag that Kim received was counterfeit but said: “We are committed to ensuring the authenticity of all products sold. We have measures in place to prevent the sale of counterfeit items.” Ssense added that all returns undergo “thorough examination.” British retailer Flannels, which sells high-end brands including Versace, Burberry and Moncler, has also been subject to , who claim that their purchases, ranging from a Saint Laurent belt to pair of Gucci monogrammed sandals, are counterfeit. (The shoppers did not respond to requests for comment from CNN seeking to verify their purchases.) Similar complaints have plagued Flannels for years: In 2018, the retailer was who had purchased Moncler items, after the Italian label said that their purchases were not genuine products. When approached by CNN, Flannels declined to comment on the allegations that the products they sold online were fake, and what it was doing to prevent potential fraudulent returns. In a sector where trust and credibility are paramount to success, it’s unlikely that an established department store or multi-brand boutique — which tends to have longstanding relationships with luxury brands — would knowingly sell a counterfeit product. Yet, as global supply chains increasingly diverge from traditional models, in response to inflationary pressures and geopolitical and economic changes, they’re getting more complex — and more challenging to police. It’s through these avenues that counterfeits may be slipping through, warned Simon Geale, executive vice president of procurement at Proxima, a supply chain firm owned by Bain & Company. One method that fake products enter the retail system may be through fraudulent returns, in which a customer returns a completely different item while claiming they’re the original product, Geale told CNN over the phone. Processing returns is a complicated and costly process, and it is possible that some stores may not have the infrastructure in place to thoroughly inspect the returned items, he warned. “It’s rare, but the impact is substantial,” Geale said, noting financial loss and reputational damage. As a customer you might go onto a website — let’s say Saks. You might buy a Prada bag thinking it’s coming from the Saks warehouse, but that might not be true. Luxury supply chain consultant and Uncovered Agency co-founder Ona Simpson Ona Simpson, a luxury supply chain consultant and the co-founder of Uncovered Agency, whose clients have included Burberry and Vivienne Westwood, asserts that big retailers are well equipped to handle returns, but the issue may be with the suppliers. While the luxury industry has traditionally operated a wholesale model (high-end stores typically purchase and hold inventory from brands), a growing number of retailers, including Net-a-Porter and Nordstrom, have turned to or , because it enables them to source high-end products while avoiding less upfront investment. The danger is that stores have less oversight over where the product has come from, said Simpson. “As a customer you might go onto a website — let’s say Saks. You might buy a Prada bag thinking it’s coming from the Saks warehouse, but that might not be true.” As to why a store might resort to such means, Simpson pointed to the exclusive nature of luxury goods, where scarcity is typically associated with desirability and value. Increasingly, to control their image and brand integrity, luxury brands have been limiting which distributors or stores can sell their products, as they instead prioritize direct retail channels (such as their own stores or e-commerce site). For example, Chanel notoriously does not sell its fashion and handbag collections online (those items can only be purchased in the brand’s physical boutiques). That can make it difficult for retailers to keep up and cater to trendy customers who want the latest launch or the buzziest brand of the moment. “A lot of high-end retailers now (stock) products from independent boutiques and suppliers because they have found this to be a way to (sell) brands they want,” said Simpson. However, that puts the retailers at risk of receiving counterfeit products without realizing, she noted. “(Stores) are trying to keep customers happy, but (fraudsters) are taking advantage of that.” Simpson’s hope is that the recent incidents will give stores a wakeup call to take greater preventative measures that protect their integrity, as well as seek greater differentiation at a time when retail has become increasingly homogenous. It’s a decision that would also benefit shoppers, who are now seemingly faced with the same choices everywhere they go, as stores stock the same fashion labels and products. “There are increased counterfeits floating around, so every step of the way, there’s a greater chance of mistakes or fraud happening,” Simpson warned.",

    "content": "Apartment owners at a luxury New York skyscraper are suing the building’s developers over a “far-reaching fraud” in which they allegedly hid structurally significant defects — including “thousands” of severe cracks on the tower’s facade. The condo board at 432 Park Avenue, a super-skinny high-rise on Manhattan’s Billionaire’s Row, claims that real estate firm CIM Group failed to disclose the extent of damage that has resulted in flooding and impacted the value of their . Filed at the state court in New York in late April, the lawsuit also names architecture and engineering companies involved in the project. Condo owners are collectively seeking more than $165 million in damages, according to the complaint. Completed in 2015, the slender 1,396-foot-tall skyscraper has a 15:1 height-to-width ratio, putting it among the so-called “pencil towers” now dotting midtown Manhattan’s skyline. To protect against high winds, the building was designed with unoccupied floors that encourage airflow, anchors drilled deep into the bedrock and “tuned mass dampers” that act like pendulums to counteract swaying. Property developer Harry Macklowe — whose firm McGraw Hudson Construction Corp is also named in the suit — compared the tower to the Empire State Building, telling in 2013 that it was “the building of the 21st century.” Pop star and Chinese businessman are among those reported to have purchased units there for eight-figure sums. But owners and residents have since complained of numerous construction issues, including more than 20 water leaks since 2017, according to the complaint. In 2021, the condo board filed a lawsuit alleging a range of defects, from malfunctioning elevators and poor energy efficiency to a trash chute that sounds “like a bomb” when used. The new lawsuit meanwhile claims that the tower’s facade is “plagued with thousands of severe cracks, spalling, and other forms of deterioration,” including a 10-inch-deep crack in the building’s core. As well as causing flooding, the damage has corroded some of the steel in the tower’s reinforced concrete columns, the complaint alleges. While the 2021 complaint also detailed “substantial cracking,” the condo board said it filed its most recent action after claiming it uncovered evidence that defendants had “conspired” to conceal the extent and seriousness of the defects. In statements provided to CNN, both CIM Group and SLCE Architects, the project’s architect of record, said they “vehemently” deny the claims and are moving to have the complaint dismissed. Engineering firm WSP declined to comment.  McGraw Hudson Construction Corp did not respond to CNN’s inquiries. The lawsuit attributes cracking to the building’s “experimental” facade, which is made from white concrete. The material is, it says, “typically used for aesthetic purposes” and had to be strengthened to withstand the supertall building’s structural load — especially during high winds. Among the suit’s allegations are claims that CIM Group ignored concerns raised by various concrete consultants, as well as the project’s late architect about the strength of the concrete mix. The condo board claims that mockup tests showed the material’s use would result in cracking. But CIM Group and its contractors “bulled forward” with “complete disregard for… the inevitable problems it would cause for the building and its future residents,” the suit adds. The condo board alleges that, despite having knowledge of the facade’s defects, SLCE Architects deceived condo owners by making “materially false” claims in its offering plan, a document disclosing important information to potential buyers. (The lawsuit cites an alleged change in the document’s wording, which went from claiming the concrete “will” prevent water penetration to saying that it was only “designed to” do so.) Additionally, the lawsuit alleges that McGraw Hudson and WSP misled New York City Department of Buildings in a letter that “misrepresented the nature, extent, and type of cracking.” It claims the letter failed to disclose the full findings of a survey that had discovered 1,893 defects. The complaint claims that developers then “repeatedly rejected” recommendations on how to address issues that arose. A suggestion that an opaque elastomeric covering could be applied to the facade to prevent air and water infiltration, for instance, was ignored because it would “significantly alter” the building’s appearance and make it less appealing to “the world’s billionaires,” the lawsuit alleges.",

    "content": "A painting by South African artist has sold for $13.6 million at auction, setting a new record for a living female artist. “Miss January” is Dumas’ “magnum opus” and stands 9.25 feet (2.82 meters) tall, according to a statement from auction house Christie’s on Wednesday. “We were thrilled with the outcome of our sale this evening,” Isabella Lauria, head of the 21st century evening sale, said in the statement, calling the price “incredible.” The painting had been expected to fetch between $12 million and $18 million, according to a separate statement from Christie’s published earlier this month. “Through its monumental scale and singular subject matter, Miss January is truly the magnum opus of Marlene Dumas,” said Sara Friedlander, deputy chairman of post-war and contemporary art at Christie’s, in the May 2 statement. “In this painting, Dumas triumphantly demonstrates a formal mastery of the woman’s body while simultaneously freeing it from a tradition of subjection, upending normalized concepts of the female nude through the lens of a male-centric history,” she added. Painted in 1997, the work sees Dumas revisit “Miss World,” an artwork depicting the forms of 10 models, which she painted 30 years prior at the age of 10. Today, Dumas is known as one of the most influential painters in the world, according to Christie’s, which said she “is known for her emotionally charged, psychologically complex portraits — often based on found photographs — which explore themes of sexuality, race, grief, motherhood, and the body.” While the sale of “Miss January” sets a new record price for a work of art by a living female artist, works by male artists have traditionally sold for much more. At Wednesday’s auction, a 1982 triple portrait by Jean-Michel Basquiat, titled “Baby Boom,” sold for $23.4 million, and the record for the most expensive artwork by a living male artist is the $90.3 million paid for US artist Jeff Koons’ “Rabbit” sculpture in 2019. And the gender gap in valuations is a systemic issue, according to 2022 BBC documentary “Recalculating Art,” which found that works by female artists sell for 10% of the value of those by men.",

    "content": "At the now wrapped-up Met Gala and the Cannes Film Festival, which is in full swing, megawatt diamonds and vibrant gemstones lit up the red carpet. Yet, it’s the rare, not-for-sale pieces drawn from jewelers’ private vaults that continue to dominate the conversation on social media. Think of Isha Ambani’s custom-made necklace — a blinding cascade of diamonds, each immaculately cut and set. The striking jewel, worn by the Indian billionaire heir to the Met Gala, was inspired by a historic Cartier design, created in the 1930s for Maharaja Digvijaysinhji of Nawanagar and later reproduced for the movie ﻿“Ocean’s 8.” Meanwhile, singer and actor Diljit Dosanjh wore a lavish, torso-spanning necklace to the event that echoed the ceremonial 1,000 carat-diamond necklace Cartier designed for Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala in the 1920s, now on display at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London. A penchant for the “old” isn’t entirely new, but it has been accelerating in recent years. When Lady Gaga grabbed headlines at the 2019 Oscars for wearing Tiffany’s show-stopping 128.54-carat yellow diamond — the same stone that was famously first worn by Audrey Hepburn during the publicity tour for “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” in 1961 — it felt like the starting gun of a new race, as the pop star became the third person to ever wear the historic diamond valued at more than $30 million. The red carpet trend of wearing archival pieces became even more noticeable at the 2022 Met Gala, when the dress code — “Gilded Glamour and White Tie” — inspired Cartier to style actor Emma Corrin in diamond earrings from the 1930s, pin a vintage flower brooch into Maude Apatow’s hair, and crown YouTube star Emma Chamberlain with a 1911 diamond tiara and a choker that was believed to have been previously owned by the Maharaja of Patiala. As the momentum around vintage and archival styles continues to grow, luxury houses are increasingly buying back their historical creations (from auctions, collectors and vintage dealers) and restoring them with meticulous care, occasionally lending them to some of the world’s most photographed celebrities for red-carpet appearances. At the BAFTAs in February, Cynthia Erivo dazzled in vintage emerald jewels from Tiffany — a nod to the green hue of her character Elphaba in “Wicked.” At the Oscars the following month, Mikey Madison accepted her first statuette wearing a diamond Tiffany necklace from the early 1900s, while Felicity Jones — nominated for her performance in ﻿“The Brutalist” — walked the red carpet in a silver gown paired with a Boucheron parure of diamond jewels, including an Art Deco bracelet from 1927. “Using heritage jewelry from the archive is incredibly appealing — not just because these pieces are considered exceptional by the Maison, but also because access to them is so rare,” explained stylist Nicky Yates, who masterminded Jones’s look. “That exclusivity helps us create a real fashion moment,” she told CNN over a text message. While some brands might seek to preserve and safeguard historical pieces, Boucheron CEO Hélène Poulit-Duquesne believes that the house’s archive is not just for archivists, but should — on occasion — be admired and worn. “We consider our patrimony (archive pieces not for sale) as living and breathing rather than museum pieces,” she explained over email. Since taking the reins in 2015, Poulit-Duquesne has expanded Boucheron’s heritage collection to over 800 creations — a selection of which are now “always included in the jewel selections presented to celebrity stylists ahead of major events around the globe,” Poulit-Duquesne said. Lending heritage jewels for the red carpet gives the house a competitive edge, Poulit-Duquesne explained. “Having them worn by international personalities with a strong sense of style — male or female — is a powerful way to show their timelessness,” she said, adding that “the fascination surrounding these historical designs creates compelling stories that resonate far beyond traditional advertising.” When pieces from the past continue to receive recognition, it’s a clear sign of their lasting creative and cultural value. Achim Berg, Independent luxury consultant And it has the potential to boost sales too. Achim Berg, an independent consultant who was a former senior partner at McKinsey & Company leading their fashion and luxury division, believes that the red carpet is a prominent platform to showcase that “jewelry is a good investment,” he told CNN. “It shows that jewelry from a top house will always remain relevant. It’s timeless. And when pieces from the past continue to receive recognition, it’s a clear sign of their lasting creative and cultural value.” Tiffany & Co. president and CEO Anthony Ledru echoed this view. “Red carpet moments have allowed us to generate excitement around our historical pieces, many of which have inspired our designs today,” he said, citing the iconic “Bird on the Rock” brooches that the late Jean Schlumberger designed for Tiffany as an example of an archival design whose sales have taken flight. It’s not only century-old brands like Cartier, Boucheron, and Tiffany that have invested in their archives and actively promote them. Pomellato, founded in 1967, is doing so as well. The Milanese brand’s history took center stage at the Fosun Foundation in Shanghai late last year, and again during Salone del Mobile in April, where jewels from its archive were showcased in-store alongside photography by Gian Paolo Barbieri. Earlier in February, at the Sanremo Music Festival held in the Italian city of Sanremo, Liguria, Pomellato’s new ambassador, actor Pilar Fogliati, wore vintage jewelry, further highlighting the house’s heritage. “It was Pilar’s choice,” according to Pomellato’s chief marketing and product officer Boris Barboni. “Pomellato was happy to lend them to her, as it allowed us to showcase creations from the past in which we recognize the same creative energy found in our contemporary jewelry as well as our identity,” he said. By investing in its heritage, Pomellato is able to rediscover its history in new ways, which can lead to inventive, new designs, Barboni added. Last November, Pomellato launched a capsule collection of “Mosaico” rings inspired by its designs from the 1990s. The red carpet is turning into a kind of cultural treasure hunt. Laurent François, Partner at Paris-based communications firm 180 “Archive matters for the final client,” said Barboni, noting that by looking to the past, “jewelry lovers can better understand the brand’s creative vision and the messages behind the designs — and truly appreciate the depth of its artistic value.” Showcasing historical pieces on the red carpet has become a surefire way to generate positive PR, said Laurent François, a partner at Paris-based communications agency 180 Global. “For luxury-savvy audiences, spotting an archival piece in a contemporary context is a thrill,” he explained over a call. “It invites deeper engagement. And there’s something generous about it, as jewelry houses offer the public a rare glimpse into its most treasured past.” “Luxury is heading now toward rich, emotionally resonant experiences that reward curiosity and signal belonging,” François added, noting that with historical pieces on show, “the red carpet is turning into a kind of cultural treasure hunt.”",

    "title": "\n      Feats of fantasy: This software engineer codes self-twirling and illuminating gowns\n    ",

    "content": "When Christina Ernst dreamed up the concept for a self-twirling dress, she made it and then programmed its robotic arms to lift the hem of a romantic pink smock gown and to spin it left and right. She turned fantasy into reality with a flickering, faux candle-lined corset top, too, as well as a cathedral gown with stained-glass-like panels that could be illuminated like windows seen at night. Over the past year, the 28-year-old has attracted hundreds of thousands of followers for her whimsical fashion projects that incorporate coding and circuitry. Based in Chicago, when Ernst isn’t working as a software engineer at Google’s West Loop office, she’s home experimenting with what she calls “fashioneering” projects, then documenting each one for her online audience. Through her tutorial website and social media accounts , she hopes to encourage more young women to enter STEM fields. “When I was growing up, I would have loved to see some sort of tech representation (for) my own interests in fashion, art and drawing,” she told CNN during an interview at Chicago Public Library’s Maker Lab, where Ernst had a 12-week residency, demonstrating how some of her designs worked. “I loved all of these things, but never thought that they had any compatibility with the tech world…It’s really important to me to center (my tutorials) on the interests that a lot of teen girls already have, to meet them where they are.” Ernst often goes for feats of fantasy, with her first viral videos documenting her Medusa dress adorned with several undulating robotic serpents, including one programmed to make eye contact using AI facial recognition. But the “stupidest” thing she’s made with her computer engineering degree — as she declared in her most-watched video — was for one of her Halloween costumes. In it, she shows a small, motorized 3D-printed replica of a familiar foodie rat affixed to a headband, pulling two small handfuls of her hair up and down in its paws as she slices up an onion in the kitchen. To test her version of Remy from “Ratatouille,” she gave the rodent yarn first so it wouldn’t yank her hair out. After seeing the reaction online, with nearly 45 million views to date across Instagram and TikTok, she took some commenters’ advice to upgrade him further. “The first version I made just had his arms going up and down. I coded them to move randomly,” she explained. “And a bunch of people in my comments had a wonderful idea to sync it up to my movements, and I just happened to have (an) accelerometer laying around. It’s a pretty common circuitry piece, so I spent the weekend wiring it up.” Ernst says she usually has multiple ambitious ideas ticking away in her mind, sometimes for months at a time. Her projects are not meant to represent the future of tech or fashion, though, as she emphasizes, but are instead a conversation-starter for young makers and designers to see technology presented in a different way. “Technology really is magical to me… When I say I make robotic dresses, I never want it to look like how people picture it,” she said. “The wonder and the whimsy is very important to me. All of my designs really introduce that aspect to (engage) people who might not traditionally be interested in engineering.” Though Ernst isn’t planning a more formal entry into fashion, robotics on the runway have led to some of the industry’s most memorable moments. In 1998, Alexander McQueen staged a frenetic moment of performance art when two robots spray-painted a dress worn by model Shalom Harlow. Two years ago, Coperni partnered with Boston Dynamics in Paris to send out the company’s robot canines to interact with models, including Lila Moss, to take off their coats and tote around handbags. The wonder-evoking combination is one that Ernst discovered early on, through the first fashion project she made in college: a Bluetooth-controlled color-changing LED dress she created during a hackathon at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The number of girls who approached her exhibition booth asking for instructions on how to recreate the dress was a “lightbulb moment”, she explained, as she realized that fashion projects could be a gateway into STEM studies. In high school, she was a mathlete who loved reworking her clothes, but felt that when it came time to apply for universities, she had to choose between the two fields. “A lot of people think that fashion is completely divorced from the sciences, but that is not true at all. The history of the computer is actually textile history,” Ernst said. The punch-card Jacquard loom, invented in the early 19th-century for weaving, is considered a precursor to modern computing because its use of binary code inspired early computer design. “That history is very interwoven.” In her own practice, Ernst combines a range of disciplines and techniques, from 3D modeling and laser cutting to hand dyeing and knitting, she explained. Because of that, she often prototypes her projects in simpler materials such as cardboard “before dropping into high-tech tools.” Since college, Ernst has explored various ways to design curriculum for students. She received a small grant in 2017 for her hackathon project to create introductory circuit projects with art and fashion in mind and provide them online for free. She also provided educational kits to five public schools in Chicago from 2022 to 2023. And this past year, she was a maker-in-residence at Chicago Public Library, teaching free classes at the Harold Washington Library branch while growing her online audience. There, she taught people from all walks of life, from young students to parents to retirees. In one case, a Girl Scout leader who attended and learned to program a motor said she would teach the new skills to her troop, Ernst recalled, and offer a new electronics badge that members could earn. During her residency, Ernst created a new design for the , a gold and blush Phoenix gown with feathers that rise and fall, activated by passersby who place their hands up to a panel on the window. The garment is a tribute to the Garden of the Phoenix, which was built in Jackson Park for the 1893 Chicago Fair as a symbol of US-Japanese friendship; the park was set on fire in the wake of World War II but was later reconstructed. Though at first, Ernst had hoped to trigger the dress using motion sensors, then through viewers’ phones, she eventually (and quickly) had to rig up a more simple solution using light-sensitive photoresistors that activate when covered. “So much of it is trial and error, and I think my computer engineering background and my software job really builds those skills of persistence, of debugging, of experimentation, and I’m able to bring that over into my experimental fashion, where I’ll often go through 6, 7, or 8 prototypes before I get close to something that works,” she said. She’s learned that showing or explaining the unsuccessful versions of her projects to her followers have sometimes become just as interesting to them. “I was surprised by how many people have commented that they like seeing the failures. They like seeing the prototypes that don’t work,” she said. “It helps them see that it is OK to fail and OK to iterate — nobody inherently knows how to do these things.”",

    "content": "After much teasing and speculation, ESPN has finally unveiled the details of its new flagship streaming service. While the streamer long had the working title “Flagship,” the Disney-owned sports network revealed the platform, slated to launch in the fall, will be called something even simpler: ESPN. “As we explored options, we kept coming back to our four letters ESPN,” network chairman James Pitaro explained during a press event on Tuesday morning. “There’s power in our name, and there’s trust in our name.” The direct-to-consumer platform will feature two subscription tiers at launch, said Roz Durant, ESPN’s executive vice president of programming and acquisitions. The unlimited plan will cost $29.99 per month (or $45.99 when bundled with Disney+ and Hulu) and will give users access to all things ESPN — including ESPNs 2 and 3, along with ESPNU, ESPN Deportes and a slate of college sports-focused networks. “That’s 47,000 live events, studio shows and more every year,” Durant said. The other plan, titled “select,” will cost $11.99 per month and will include all content currently available on the ESPN+ over-the-top service. Since the platform was first announced, Disney executives have touted the streamer as an immersive new experience for sports fans. During , Disney chief executive Bob Iger hailed the streaming service as “very user-friendly because it’s more app-based.” The streamer reveal comes as Disney looks to shore up its subscriber numbers, as its linear networks have been challenged by the same cord-cutting habits as the rest of the industry. However, live sporting events have proved relatively impervious to the viewership declines felt across traditional television. That’s why Disney was willing to spend big to ensure ESPN would retain its , especially among an overcrowded streaming sector, with heavyweights like Netflix, Amazon’s Prime Video and WBD’s Max carving up access to sporting events. During its quarterly report last week, Disney despite the economic headwinds from President Donald Trump’s tariff chaos. Revenue at ESPN was up 5% to $4.53 billion, even as operating income dropped 16%. Disney attributed that drop to increased programming and production costs from three additional college football playoff games and an added NFL game during the quarter, though these helped increase domestic advertising revenue 29%. To ensure a smooth launch, Iger said on the earnings call that linear ESPN subscribers will automatically get the ESPN flagship streamer. ESPN’s streamer reveal comes just over four months after , the joint sports streaming venture among Warner Bros. Discovery, Disney, and Fox. In Venu’s final months, Disney began touting its own streaming platform, hedging its bets as it became increasingly clear there was no path for Venu to launch. (WBD is CNN’s parent company.) The trio’s decision not to launch the JV came after they four days earlier. Despite that, reports had emerged that satellite TV providers DirecTV and Dish had asked a judge to reconsider dismissing Fubo’s case, signaling further delays in the platform’s launch.",

Reversing a lower court decision, a New York appeals court ruled Tuesday that Fox News can obtain disputed materials about a separate against senior Smartmatic executives. The conservative cable network says the documents are crucial to its defense in the defamation lawsuit. Smartmatic, a voting technology company based in Florida, sued Fox News and its in 2021, claiming that the network’s conspiracy theory-tinged coverage of the 2020 election destroyed its reputation. Numerous on-air hosts and guests that Smartmatic machines rigged the 2020 results against President Donald Trump. Adding to its legal troubles, three current and former executives at Smartmatic were with allegedly paying more than $1 million in bribes to secure a contract in the Philippines. The defendants in the bribery case have pleaded not guilty, and Smartmatic denies criminal wrongdoing. Fox has argued that if Smartmatic’s reputation was damaged, it was because of its controversial foreign dealings — not because of news coverage about the 2020 election. “We are pleased with the Court’s ruling that materials about Smartmatic executives’ indictments are ‘plainly relevant’ to its lack of damages,” Fox said in a statement on Tuesday. “The factual evidence shows that Smartmatic’s business and reputation were badly suffering long before any claims by President Trump’s lawyers on Fox News.” Lawyers from Fox News say the case threatens First Amendment press freedoms.

(Pro-Trump cable channel Newsmax from Smartmatic for $40 million last year.) “The discovery that Smartmatic has already produced shows that Fox’s campaign of lies was the number one cause of Smartmatic’s injuries,” Smartmatic lawyer Erik Connolly said in a statement. “Fox trying to blame anyone other than itself for Smartmatic’s injuries is just more lies from Fox. The writing is on the wall. Lies have consequences.” Both Fox and Smartmatic have asked the New York judge presiding over the case to end the lawsuit now without going to a jury. Those motions are still pending. If there isn’t a settlement, the case could possibly head to trial by 2026.",

    "content": "A voting technology firm suing Fox News for defamation over its 2020 election coverage claimed senior corporate executives, including Rupert Murdoch, intentionally destroyed damning evidence in the case, according to court filings. Smartmatic levied the stunning new allegations on Wednesday, alleging in court filings that Fox “orchestrated the destruction of text messages across all levels of their corporate hierarchy… despite a clear duty to preserve evidence.” In the highly redacted filings, Smartmatic claimed Murdoch and his son Lachlan Murdoch were among the Fox officials who “deleted their texts” in an “extensive and willful” fashion — and not by accident. Rupert Murdoch was chairman of Fox Corporation during the 2020 election, and his son was CEO. The elder Murdoch and his son became Fox Corp. chairman. A Fox spokesperson said the latest allegations from Smartmatic were a “desperate attempt to distract” from a recent evidentiary ruling that was decided in the network’s favor. “Smartmatic weakly attempts to resurrect stale, baseless discovery issues that actually were disclosed by Fox and resolved two years ago,” the Fox spokesperson said. “These issues have no bearing on the merits of Smartmatic’s case, which has fallen apart at every turn.” Smartmatic claimed the deleted texts were from November and December 2020, when numerous Fox hosts promoted the debunked lie that Smartmatic machines rigged that year’s presidential election against President Donald Trump. Evidence established that around the same time, Rupert Murdoch and other top Fox officials – as well as on-air hosts, producers, and fact-checkers – said they did not believe the claims of massive voter fraud that were being promoted on Fox News’ shows. “Fox has eliminated contemporaneous texts that would have revealed further evidence of what Fox executives knew about the falsity of their broadcasts,” Smartmatic lawyers wrote in the filing. “While it championed election fraud on air, behind the scenes Fox ensured that many of its executives’ incriminating communications would never see daylight.” The long-running lawsuit doesn’t yet have a trial date in New York state court. Smartmatic asked the judge overseeing the case to tell the eventual jury that Fox destroyed evidence, and that they can assume that the evidence would’ve hurt Fox’s defense. The right-wing network denies wrongdoing and says the case threatens First Amendment press freedoms. Fox’s lawyers have said Smartmatic is “a failing election company that was in financial free fall” and the lawsuit is nothing more than a “meritless cash grab.” The latest evidentiary squabbles come as both sides try to strengthen their hand before a trial, or in potential settlement negotiations, which are commonly how major defamation cases are resolved. On Tuesday, an to documents about a against senior Smartmatic executives, which the network believes will bolster its defense in the defamation lawsuit. (The defendants in that bribery case have pleaded not guilty and Smartmatic has denied any wrongdoing.) Lawyers for Fox have argued that Smartmatic isn’t entitled to the billions of dollars its seeking in damages because its reputation was already tarnished by its controversial foreign dealings, as highlighted by the alleged laid out in the federal indictment. Earlier in the litigation, which has been ongoing since February 2021, Smartmatic faced accusations from Fox of improperly deleting materials, which the voting company denied. A New York appeals court ruled that Smartmatic needed to provide Fox with some of its internal communications about deleting text messages. A Fox spokesperson said Wednesday that the network would soon file its own motion outlining this “massive failure to preserve evidence” by Smartmatic.",

WBD executives emphasized that the move is an attempt to emphasize its strongest offerings. “We all know this industry is cluttered. Streaming has become a lot like fast fashion,” Max chief marketing officer Shauna Spenley said on Wednesday. “So when we think about our competitive advantage, it’s the same one that we’ve had at HBO for the last 50 years.” WBD changed HBO Max’s name to Max in 2023 shortly after WarnerMedia and Discovery merged, creating WBD, in 2022. The company originally rebranded the service as HBO Max in 2020, having pivoted away from the previous name HBO Now, which it announced in 2015. (WBD is also CNN’s parent company.) By changing the streaming platform’s name roughly two years ago, WBD intended to highlight its diversity of offerings, which include original IP from HBO, Warner Bros. Pictures and Discovery. While Warner Bros. Pictures has seen box office success recently with “A Minecraft Movie” and “Sinners,” the company has suffered several misfires. For years, WBD’s superhero arm, DC Studios, has lagged behind Disney’s Marvel Studios, which, despite historic successes, have seen diminishing returns in recent years as audiences experience superhero fatigue. The change pushes HBO, the crown jewel in WBD’s content coffers, to the forefront as it looks to draw audiences to the platform. Though WBD’s saw Max report 5.3 million new subscribers, the company still lags behind rivals Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.",

    "content": "A Democratic commissioner on the Federal Communications Commission tore into the panel’s recent actions under its new chairman, without naming him, saying the agency has been “weaponized to chill speech and to punish the press.” “We are witnessing a dangerous precedent: the transformation of an independent regulator into an instrument of political censorship,” Anna Gomez, a 2023 Biden appointee, said Thursday at the 2025 Media Institute Communications Forum in Washington, DC. Gomez did not directly name Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed FCC chair who has used his authority to pressure media outlets President Donald Trump has deemed unfavorable. Carr has over their sponsorship practices; reopened a probe of CBS for “news distortion;” against ABC for its handling of a presidential debate between Trump and then-Vice President Kamala Harris; and opened new probes into NBCUniversal and Disney, ABC’s parent company, over . “This FCC has made clear that it will go after any news outlet that dares to report the truth if that truth is unfavorable to this administration,” Gomez said. In contrast, she applauded past FCC chairs who demonstrated “courage” by “refusing to wield the agency’s licensing authority as a weapon… even in the face of political pressure.” Gomez said she will “refuse to stay quiet” as the federal government “weaponizes its regulatory tools” to violate the First Amendment and attack the news media. After fellow commissioner , Gomez will be the lone Democrat on the five-seat commission, alongside Carr and another Trump appointee. The remaining slot currently sits vacant. “Unfortunately, the administration efforts to censor and control appear to be working, at least for now,” Gomez said. “Some media outlets are finding it is easier to retreat in the face of government threats, veiled or otherwise, than to be responsive to their audiences.” Gomez pointed to changes at CBS News and its flagship news program “60 Minutes” as examples of what gets lost when political pressure comes to bear on reporting the news. CBS News is reportingly considering a of , which accuses the broadcaster of deliberately mis-editing a “60 Minutes” interview with Harris to manipulate the November election. While many experts have deemed the lawsuit to be bogus, CBS parent Paramount Global has begun discussing a settlement, especially as company chair Shari Redstone looks to — a deal that will require signoff from Carr’s FCC. The pressure to settle the lawsuit and clear the way for a merger has trickled down to CBS News. In late April, longtime “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens because he felt he could no longer make “independent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes,” according to a memo he wrote to the show’s staff. Days later, the newsmagazine’s host Scott Pelley that Paramount had begun “to supervise our content in new ways” amid the Trump pressure, leading Owens to feel “he had lost the independence that honest journalism requires.” “Pardon my language, but that is a B.F.D.,” Gomez said on Thursday of the “60 Minutes” ordeal, using a shorthand for “big f**ing deal.” She continued: “Corporate parents should give journalists the independence they need. A free press requires free journalists.” Gomez closed by saying that if she’s removed from her seat, “it wasn’t because I failed to do my job. It’s because I insisted on doing it.”",

    "content": "In 2025, Dan Bongino, , disappointed the 2023 version of himself. In 2023, Dan Bongino, star podcaster, demanded to know: “What the hell are they hiding with Jeffrey Epstein?” “I have reviewed the case. Jeffrey Epstein killed himself,” he . Bongino was flooded with replies, many of the accusatory variety, from people who refuse to believe him. The backlash to Bongino’s factual statement is part of a broader political phenomenon. Some self-identified loyalists of President Trump Trump’s top law enforcement officials, partly because of the unsupported MAGA media claims that made those officials popular in the first place. Conspiracy thinking has been a defining trait of the MAGA movement for as long as Trump has been a political candidate. Right-wing media personalities like Bongino, acting as Trump’s top attack dogs, routinely floated unproven theories as a way to malign Trump’s political opponents. But now some of that conspiratorial talk has boomeranged back around. Listeners accustomed to “just asking questions” innuendo aren’t accepting the answers they’re getting. Bongino’s contentious post on X came after he and his boss, FBI director Kash Patel, appeared on Maria Bartiromo’s Fox News show. The choice of platform was telling: Bartiromo is , her show is a regular promoter of pro-Trump conspiracy theories and is widely trusted by the president’s base. Sunday’s telecast was billed as a long-awaited exclusive interview. Patel and Bongino blamed past FBI leaders for political bias and insisted that they are fixing what Trump fans believe is broken about the agency. “You’re about to see a wave of transparency,” Patel said in response to Bartiromo’s pressure for “accountability” over the FBI’s now-infamous Trump-Russia probe. But the two men also repeatedly tried to tamp down expectations about future revelations. And in a couple of cases they tried to deflate conspiratorial claims that have propped up and united Trump’s base. Numerous MAGA media influencers have argued that the government is covering up information about last year’s Trump assassination attempts, for example. Bongino tried to let those people down easy. When Bartiromo asked about the cases, he let out a sigh, then emphasized that he had personally reviewed all the evidence. “I’m not going to tell people what they want to hear. I’m going to tell you the truth,” he said. “And whether you like it or not is up to you. If there was a big explosive ‘there’ there… we would have told you.” Bongino, who used to host a show on Fox, seemed astutely aware of his audience during the interview. It is an audience that favors Fox’s hyperpartisan opinion shows over hard news coverage; an audience that eagerly shares social media memes about supposed liberal criminality and corruption. “In Bongino’s case, his audience has been told for years that prominent liberals and deep-state operatives have committed blatant crimes against the Trump family that should be easy to prosecute,” Will Sommer of The Bulwark . “Yet no top Democrats have been indicted, leading Trump fans to believe Bongino is falling down on the job.” Bongino has repeatedly asked for patience in his social media posts. “Just because you don’t immediately see it doesn’t mean it isn’t happening,” in one such X post last month. Some of his former viewers and listeners are deeply skeptical — of everything that conflicts with their preferred version of reality. Bartiromo alluded to that in the interview when she said to Patel, “You said Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide. People don’t believe it.” “Listen,” Patel said, “they have a right to their opinion,” but then he joined Bongino in trying to extinguish a conspiracy theory that has raged in right-wing media circles ever since Epstein died in 2019. In on Sunday, Bongino told people, “I’m not asking you to believe me, or not. I’m telling you what exists, and what doesn’t. If new evidence surfaces I’m happy to reevaluate.” Tommy Vietor, who served in the Obama administration and now co-hosts “Pod Save America,” that it was “fascinating to watch Patel and Bongino transition from feeding the base lies and conspiracy theories to being in positions of actual responsibility and occasionally having to tell the truth.” On topics like the January 6 attack, which stirred many far-right conspiracy theories that attempted to absolve Trump of blame, Patel said, “We’ve got answers coming.” But as Bongino put it, when referring to the assassination attempts, “in some of these cases, the ‘there’ you’re looking for, is not there.”",

    "title": "\n      CBS News boss Wendy McMahon exits amid Trump pressure\n    ",

    "publication_date": "2025-05-19T16:03:34.184Z",
    "cate": "business",
    "content": "The top executive in charge of CBS News resigned on Monday amid President Trump’s intensifying political pressure against the news operation. Wendy McMahon alluded to a “challenging” past few months in a farewell memo to employees. “It’s become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward,” she wrote. “It’s time for me to move on and for this organization to move forward with new leadership.” While McMahon did not address Trump’s against CBS in the memo, the suit has been top of mind in recent months. McMahon has publicly stood up for the news division while its parent company, Paramount Global, has sought to settle with Trump while trying to win administration approval for its pending merger with Skydance Media. The clash between editorial principles and corporate priorities has profoundly shaken CBS, one of America’s most distinguished broadcast networks. Last month, “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens, who ran the program that triggered Trump’s ire, said he was stepping down, citing a loss of independence. Owens and McMahon praised each other at the time, signaling a united front against Trump’s legal attacks. Thus, McMahon’s exit — coming one day after the season finale of “60 Minutes,” no less — has employees feeling “like a purge is underway,” as one CBS correspondent told CNN on Monday. The correspondent spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not allowed to speak publicly. McMahon’s departure also stirred speculation that a Paramount settlement with Trump is imminent. The company has not commented. In a memo on Monday morning, Paramount Global co-CEO George Cheeks thanked McMahon for four years of leadership. He said that McMahon’s recently named number two, CBS News president Tom Cibrowski, will now report directly to him. A person with knowledge of the matter pointed out that McMahon’s departure removes a layer of management at a time when Paramount is trying to slim down and spend less. McMahon’s future was also far from certain under Skydance, the company that is trying to take control of CBS and the rest of Paramount. But by stepping down now, and referencing corporate disagreements about the “path forward,” McMahon is highlighting Paramount’s controversial dealings with the president. Trump sued CBS over the editing of last October’s “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. The suit’s allegations that CBS violated the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, a consumer protection law, have been derided by legal experts as frivolous and ridiculous. CBS lawyers defended “60 Minutes” and its editorial judgment on First Amendment grounds. But Trump has blasted the network over and over again, at times even , an agency he has sought to control, to punish CBS by revoking its licenses. With the FCC tasked with reviewing the Paramount-Skydance deal, top executives sought to settle with Trump to make the lawsuit go away. Mediation talks reportedly began at the end of April. The notion of a settlement is anathema to “60 Minutes” employees. The transcript of the Harris interview, which CBS provided to the FCC in February, confirmed what the network said all along: It engaged in normal editing, not any nefarious activity like Trump alleged. Months before resigning, Owens told “60 Minutes” employees that he would not apologize as part of any settlement, since the newsmagazine did not do anything to warrant saying sorry. McMahon also told colleagues that apologizing was a “red line” she would not cross, according to two sources who spoke with her about it. Despite Trump’s attacks, “60 Minutes” continued to broadcast probing reports about his administration all winter and spring long. McMahon acknowledged the viewing audience in her memo Monday, writing, “Thank you for your trust. You hold us accountable, and you remind us why this work matters.” , one of the Democrats on the Republican-controlled FCC, that McMahon’s departure was “beyond alarming.” “Independent journalists are being silenced simply because their reporting may threaten the ambitions of their corporate owners,” Gomez wrote. “It will only embolden an Administration hell-bent on censoring speech and controlling content.”",

    "content": "Sometimes the arguments could be heard well down the hall. The topic was “60 Minutes,” and the tension was audible. CBS News chief Wendy McMahon was clashing with her bosses over upcoming stories on the newsmagazine — in part because President Trump’s legally dubious lawsuit against CBS meant that billions of dollars were at risk. “Wendy was standing up for us,” a veteran CBS journalist said. “There’s a lot of fear about what happens with her gone now.” McMahon , under pressure from CBS parent Paramount Global, intensifying the impression that CBS News is in distress due to Trump’s political pressure and other business factors. While CBS journalists are doing their jobs and covering the Trump administration assertively, Paramount lawyers are trying to strike a settlement with Trump, perhaps believing that such a deal will help secure the administration’s approval of a pending merger. With the Trump tug-of-war on everyone’s minds, getting and keeping “60 Minutes” on the air this spring was a week-by-week challenge, according to people at the network. McMahon repeatedly defended the program in conversations with Paramount Global co-CEO George Cheeks, who himself was under pressure from controlling shareholder Shari Redstone. While some of the internal battles have been previously reported, five sources who spoke with CNN on condition of anonymity said the fights were much more fraught than the viewing public realizes. There was one hint about it on-air, last month, after “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens resigned, . “No one here is happy about it,” correspondent Scott Pelley Owens had sensed. The alleged corporate meddling began several months earlier. One of the disputes was over CBS News coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. Redstone, a strong supporter of Israel and Jewish causes, lodged objections over what she sensed was biased coverage of the conflict. For a newsmagazine like “60 Minutes” with a long, proud tradition of independence, Redstone’s involvement was deeply troubling. One of her chief complaints was about a January “60 Minutes” segment that highlighted America’s support for Israel’s bombing of Gaza. McMahon mediated the conflict over that report, as well as multiple disputes over “60 Minutes” reports about Trump’s return to office and the impact of his administration’s policy changes. It was clear, the five sources said, that Paramount was primarily concerned about how the tough Trump coverage would impact the lawsuit and settlement talks. (The New York Times that Trump’s team threatened to file another lawsuit over a “60 Minutes” segment on Trump targeting big law firms.) One of the people involved said McMahon played the role of educator, or at least tried to, “explaining the importance of journalistic independence” to Paramount leadership. There is a long history of news division chiefs serving as firewalls between a corporate parent and a newsroom. The big difference in this case is the Trump lawsuit over last October’s “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris, which Trump claimed was deliberately mis-edited at the behest of the Democratic campaign. Legal experts have derided the lawsuit , and CBS defended the newsmagazine and its editorial judgment on First Amendment grounds. A of the Harris interview only further confirmed that “60 Minutes” engaged in normal editing processes. However, the suit posed a very serious problem for Redstone, who struck a merger deal with Skydance Media in mid-2024. That deal is now awaiting Trump administration approval. Redstone has pushed to settle the lawsuit, despite the widely held assessment that CBS lawyers would prevail against Trump in court. In a letter to Redstone that was made public on Tuesday, three Democratic senators questioned whether Paramount is in danger of violating bribery laws. That question has also come up inside CBS News. At “60 Minutes,” “everyone thinks this lawsuit is an act of extortion, everyone,” a network correspondent told CNN. The far-flung “60 Minutes” staff — while rarely all together at the network’s midtown Manhattan headquarters — is united in confidence that the program did nothing wrong, despite Trump’s wild allegations about the Harris interview. But there is also a widespread sense of resignation that the Trump settlement will happen, one way or another. Citing a source close to the negotiations, CNN’s Jake Tapper reported that Paramount could pay Trump as much as $30 to 50 million. McMahon and Owens told colleagues that they would not apologize to Trump as a part of any settlement, so their departures may portend an imminent deal. McMahon had detractors in and around CBS, too, and those people have pointed to other reasons for her exit. The news division’s recent reformatting of the “CBS Evening News” is widely thought to be a misfire, for instance, and the newscast will likely be retooled — again — once McMahon is out of the picture. But “despite all her miscalculations, she was viewed as the last thing standing between us and Redstone,” one of the sources said. When Owens stepped down, CBS journalists feared that in-the-works “60 Minutes” segments about Trump could be quashed. Journalists talked with each other about how to preserve the material. According to several sources, McMahon worked behind the scenes to protect the reports. McMahon, Cheeks and Redstone have not commented about the “60 Minutes” disputes. Ultimately, the newsmagazine’s reputation has been protected. Week after week, CBS has broadcast substantive investigations about Trump and other subjects. Ahead of the newsmagazine’s traditional mid-May season finale, a scheduled report about Trump’s planned cutbacks to the IRS was held back, but for sound journalistic reasons, according to the network. A CBS spokesperson said that “the roughly 7,000 probationary employees who were dismissed from their jobs” at the IRS were being called back to work, thus changing the segment altogether. “Our team will continue to report on these new details and will broadcast the story in the future,” CBS said. With McMahon exiting, her recently named No. 2, CBS News president Tom Cibrowski, will now report directly to Cheeks. CBS journalists said they are hopeful that Cibrowski, an award-winning journalist and executive, will act as a heat shield with Paramount — and Skydance, assuming the merger is approved.",

The Moscow branch of the committee, which deals with major criminal cases in Russia, said Tuesday that it had opened the case against Russian-born Galina Timchenko, co-founder and head of the Meduza publication. Meduza, which reports in detail on Moscow’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor, said in an announcement posted online that Timchenko faced six years in prison if convicted. The committee said the case was based on organizing the activities of an “undesirable organization” and posting videos “to foment protest sentiment and to involve the public in the activities” of such an organization. Institutions deemed “undesirable” on grounds that they threaten Russia’s constitutional order can be subject to fines or orders to dissolve. Timchenko, who had previously headed up prominent publications inside Russia, was last year declared a “foreign agent,” a designation that carries negative Soviet-era connotations and imposes difficult bureaucratic requirements. Hundreds of Russian nationals have had the designation imposed on them. Since Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022, parliament has approved legislation cracking down on dissent in the country, including fines and prison terms for discrediting or spreading false information about the army.",

    "content": "Less than a few hours after Snapchat rolled out its My AI chatbot to all users last week, Lyndsi Lee, a mother from East Prairie, Missouri, told her 13-year-old daughter to stay away from the feature. “It’s a temporary solution until I know more about it and can set some healthy boundaries and guidelines,” said Lee, who works at a software company. She worries about how presents itself to young users like her daughter on Snapchat. The feature is powered by the viral AI chatbot tool ChatGPT – and like ChatGPT, it can offer recommendations, answer questions and converse with users. But Snapchat’s version has some key differences: Users can customize the chatbot’s name, design a custom Bitmoji avatar for it, and bring it into conversations with friends. The net effect is that conversing with Snapchat’s chatbot may feel less transactional than visiting ChatGPT’s website. It also may be less clear you’re talking to a computer. “I don’t think I’m prepared to know how to teach my kid how to emotionally separate humans and machines when they essentially look the same from her point of view,” Lee said. “I just think there is a really clear line [Snapchat] is crossing.” The new tool is facing backlash not only from parents but also from some Snapchat users who are bombarding the app with bad reviews in the app store and criticisms on social media over privacy concerns, “creepy” exchanges and an inability to remove the feature from their chat feed unless they pay for a premium subscription. While some may find value in the tool, the mixed reactions hint at the risks companies face in rolling out new generative AI technology to their products, and particularly in products like Snapchat, whose users skew younger. Snapchat was an early launch partner when OpenAI to ChatGPT to third-party businesses, with many more expected to follow. Almost overnight, Snapchat has forced some families and lawmakers to reckon with questions that may have seemed theoretical only months ago. In a to the CEOs of Snap and other tech companies last month, weeks after My AI was released to Snap’s subscription customers, Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet raised concerns about the interactions the chatbot was having with younger users. In particular, he cited reports that it can provide kids with suggestions for how to lie to their parents. “These examples would be disturbing for any social media platform, but they are especially troubling for Snapchat, which almost 60 percent of American teenagers use,” Bennet wrote. “Although Snap concedes My AI is ‘experimental,’ it has nevertheless rushed to enroll American kids and adolescents in its social experiment.” In a blog post last week, the company said: “My AI is far from perfect but we’ve made a lot of progress.” In the days since its formal launch, Snapchat users have been vocal about their concerns. One user called his interaction “terrifying” after he said it lied about not knowing where the user was located. After the user lightened the conversation, he said the chatbot accurately revealed he lived in Colorado. In another TikTok video with more than 1.5 million views, a user named Ariel recorded a song with an intro, chorus and piano chords written by My AI about what it’s like to be a chatbot. When she sent the recorded song back, she said the chatbot denied its involvement with the reply: “I’m sorry, but as an AI language model, I don’t write songs.” Ariel called the exchange “creepy.” Other users shared concerns about how the tool understands, interacts with and collects information from photos. “I snapped a picture … and it said ‘nice shoes’ and asked who the people [were] in the photo,” a Snapchat user wrote on Facebook. Snapchat told CNN it continues to improve My AI based on community feedback and is working to establish more guardrails to keep its users safe. The company also said that similar to its other tools, users don’t have to interact with My AI if they don’t want to. It’s not possible to remove My AI from chat feeds, however, unless a user subscribes to its monthly premium service, Snapchat+. Some teens say they have opted to pay the $3.99 Snapchat+ fee to turn off the tool before promptly canceling the service. But not all users dislike the feature. One user wrote on Facebook that she’s been asking My AI for homework help. “It gets all of the questions right.” Another noted she’s leaned on it for comfort and advice. “I love my little pocket, bestie!” she wrote. “You can change the Bitmoji [avatar] for it and surprisingly it offers really great advice to some real life situations. … I love the support it gives.” ChatGPT, which is trained on vast troves of data online, has previously come for spreading inaccurate information, responding to users in ways they might find inappropriate and enabling students to cheat. But Snapchat’s integration of the tool risks heightening some of these issues, and adding new ones. Alexandra Hamlet, a clinical psychologist in New York City, said the parents of some of her patients have expressed concern about how their teenager could interact with Snapchat’s tool. There’s also concern around chatbots giving advice and about mental health because AI tools can reinforce someone’s confirmation bias, making it easier for users to seek out interactions that confirm their unhelpful beliefs. “If a teen is in a negative mood and does not have the awareness desire to feel better, they may seek out a conversation with a chatbot that they know will make them feel worse,” she said. “Over time, having interactions like these can erode a teens’ sense of worth, despite their knowing that they are really talking to a bot. In an emotional state of mind, it becomes less possible for an individual to consider this type of logic.” For now, the onus is on parents to start meaningful conversations with their teens about best practices for communicating with AI, especially as the tools start to show up in more popular apps and services. Sinead Bovell, the founder of WAYE, a startup that helps prepare youth for future with advanced technologies, said parents need to make it very clear “chatbots are not your friend.” “They’re also not your therapists or a trusted adviser, and anyone interacting with them needs to be very cautious, especially teenagers who may be more susceptible to believing what they say,” she said. “Parents should be talking to their kids now about how they shouldn’t share anything personal with a chatbot that they would a friend – even though from a user design perspective, the chatbot exists in the same corner of Snapchat.” She added that federal regulation that would require companies to abide by specific protocols is also needed to keep up the rapid pace of AI advancement.",

    "content": "One day in September, I stood in front of my open refrigerator, ravenous but unable to figure out what I should eat. I was worried that whatever I chose to eat would cause the new app on my phone to record a spike in my glucose levels that would count against the number I was allowed that day – and I was determined to conquer this algorithm. I’d just put on a a device that sticks to your arm and uses a tiny needle to provide near-real-time information about how much sugar is circulating in your blood – not because I have diabetes, the main use for what are called CGMs, but because these devices are starting to be marketed as wellness tools for everybody, and I wanted to see how they work. Apple? Too sugary. Granola bar? Hello, glucose spike. Cheese – that’s the ticket. A few days of wearing this monitor had taught me that cheese would not cause my glucose to go up. “Is this thing just inadvertently putting you on the ?” my husband – who’d witnessed a few episodes of hanger while I was trying to figure out how to please my CGM – finally asked. Pretty much. Avoiding carbohydrates and prioritizing protein and fat, often together, didn’t lead to spikes in glucose that my CGM and app, from the health company Abbott, would count against me. But because I wasn’t aiming to switch to a very low-carb, ketogenic diet, I initially struggled to figure out what to eat; in the first week or so of wearing the CGM, my scale read my weight at 3 pounds lower than usual – a blip, I presume, because I was too nervous to eat normally. This is not, unsurprisingly, how experts say CGMs should be used, whether you have diabetes or not. Continuous glucose monitors have been revolutionary for people with type 1 diabetes, for whom glucose levels are life and death, providing information about how much insulin they need to inject to keep their blood sugar stable. The alternative is , pricking fingertips to draw drops of blood to check glucose levels, often multiple times a day. “CGMs are life-changing for insulin-dependent diabetics,” said , an attorney and advocate for lower insulin prices who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes as a teenager. Before she got a CGM, she said, she’d go long periods without checking her glucose levels through finger-stick tests, instead adjusting her insulin doses based on how she was feeling, leading to hospitalizations with a dangerous condition known as . Now, Marston said, she knows her glucose level every five minutes with a CGM, and her A1C, another measure of glucose in the blood, is steadily at a much better level – something she attributes both to the CGM and to focusing more on dealing with diabetes and having steadier health insurance. In that context, CGMs are medical devices, requiring prescriptions and – , but not always – receiving coverage through health insurance. CGMs can be covered for people with type 2 diabetes who use insulin, as well. But this year, and , the two major makers of CGMs, introduced biosensors for people who don’t use insulin, available without a prescription and for about $89 a month out of pocket. Dexcom’s offering, called Stelo, was by the US Food and Drug Administration in March, based on data from a clinical study showing that the device performed similarly to other CGMs. In an FDA release, Dr. Jeff Shuren, then director of the agency’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said that “CGMs can be a powerful tool to help monitor blood glucose” and that “giving more individuals valuable information about their health, regardless of their access to a doctor or health insurance, is an important step forward in advancing health equity for US patients.” Abbott’s Lingo was in June and is targeted specifically for “consumers who want to better understand and improve their health and wellness,” the company said in a news release. The idea is that seeing near-instantaneous feedback to the glucose effects of food, exercise, sleep and stress might give people insights about unique ways their bodies react to different inputs and help them make changes to improve their health. I was excited to try it. Putting the device on was surprisingly painless, and an hour after the little disc was secured to my arm, I started seeing my glucose levels on the accompanying app on my phone. “117,” I messaged , a physician at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center who works with people with obesity and diabetes and who’d offered to review my CGM findings with me. The Lingo app told me that was within what it called a “typical healthy glucose range” of 70 to 140 milligrams per deciliter, noting that “occasionally, you may find yourself over 140 mg/dL or under 70 mg/dL, which is expected.” Dushay had warned me before I put on the CGM that blood sugar could range from the high 50s when fasting to the 150s after eating in a generally healthy young woman. She also emphasized that continuous glucose monitoring shouldn’t be used to diagnose prediabetes or diabetes. Her caution about how I might react to seeing my data turned out to be warranted. In the first week I wore the monitor, I was glued to the app, watching my glucose rise shortly after eating. The app accumulates metrics that it calls to try to help users make sense of the data, with a higher number associated with a bigger or longer elevation of glucose. Although the app gave me an initial target of 60 or under for my daily Lingo Count, I found myself trying to keep it as low as possible, a tendency reinforced by the app’s suggestions to do 20 squats after lunch to “find some balance” as my count was going up. I ended up keeping my count so low initially that the app reset my daily target to 22, which I exceeded frequently once some of my anxiety wore off. And although the finding that cheese didn’t lead to a glucose spike wasn’t a huge surprise, there were a few other readings that were interesting. A salad with chopped vegetables and quinoa that I thought was a healthy choice for a quick lunch registered one of my largest Lingo Counts of the week, probably because of the sugar in the peanut dressing. A glass of wine and a slice of pizza, on the other hand, didn’t cause a glucose surge – a happy revelation but not one that I can pretend will lead to better health. “Your values are all completely normal,” Dushay told me when I sent her screengrabs of my glucose levels. “What look like ‘spikes’ are perfectly fine excursions within the normal range.” But could those increases, even within a normal range, give me feedback on ways I could feel healthier? Stay full longer? Have more energy? Lower my risk of metabolic disease? Or would I learn only that, as Marston put it, my “pancreas functions as it should”? It depends on whom you ask; the scientific community appears to be divided on the value of continuous glucose monitoring for people who don’t have diabetes, a gulf that researchers say is exacerbated by a lack of data. There are “definitely a lot of strong opinions in the field,” said , an assistant professor at Boston University’s Chobanian and Avedisian School of Medicine who studies CGM use in non-diabetic people. Spartano said she conducted a study in which she surveyed clinicians who had expertise on CGMs and asked them to interpret about 20 reports on glucose levels in people without diabetes. “There’s no consensus about how they view the data,” she said. “Some people think high spikes are bad; some people think they’re meaningless in people without diabetes; some people think, ‘if it’s a prolonged period of a glucose excursion,’” over 180 or so, those people should be screened for diabetes; “other experts will see that and say that person is fine.” , professor emeritus of pediatrics in the Division of Endocrinology at the University of California San Francisco, who’s written several books warning against excess sugar and processed foods, is in the camp that says keeping glucose down is crucial. He argues that continuous glucose monitoring is useful for people without diabetes – if users get the right help interpreting their data. “Not everybody responds to the same foods as everyone else,” said Lustig, who’s an adviser to a company called that offers continuous glucose monitoring along with an app. “The goal is to keep your glucose down, because when you keep your glucose down, you keep your insulin down, and when you keep your insulin down, then the insulin is not there to drive energy into fat, and it’s not there to cause cell growth, which is at the heart of chronic metabolic disease.” Lustig acknowledged that people using CGMs could experience the same anxiety I initially felt about the glucose data - but argued that anxiety could be lessened if users receive more help interpreting the information. And Dushay and Spartano emphasized that it would be particularly important for people who have a history of disordered eating or other food anxiety to talk with health-care providers before using a CGM. But for some, the devices provide surprising insights about how different people react to foods – like CNN’s chief medical correspondent, , who’s worn a CGM along with his wife, Rebecca. Neither has diabetes, but they were curious about what they could learn to potentially improve their health. “When I eat blueberries, my glucose will not spike at all,” he said. “When she eats blueberries, her glucose will immediately spike.” With rice, he said, it’s the opposite: His glucose spikes, while Rebecca’s doesn’t. An Indian flatbread he’s been eating since he was a kid also caused a major increase. And sometimes, Gupta said, his glucose can go up to 180 milligrams per deciliter. With a history of diabetes in his family, which he’s discussed on his “ ” podcast, that’s enough to make him want to avoid those foods. After four weeks of wearing a CGM – each biosensor device lasts two weeks – I decided to take a break and formulate a better plan before I applied my third and final monitor. I realized that the way I’d approached it the first time around was, as Dushay put it, “an artificial experiment”: I wasn’t using the CGM to get feedback about how I normally eat; I was eating abnormally in immediate response to the CGM. “Your first biosensor [should be] a look at what you’ve been doing over time, kind of what your body’s been experiencing, even though you didn’t have that peek behind the curtain,” said , nutritionist for Abbott’s Lingo business. “And then you’re starting to experiment with a few different food choices, timing of meals, et cetera. And then with your next biosensor, you’re going to be fine-tuning those habits.” I decided not to look at my glucose levels for the first week of wearing the final monitor, recording my food by hand and entering it into the app at the end of each day. And in the second week, I’d try to make changes. I also repeated some meals to measure whether my glucose response was consistent, as a National Institutes of Health found significant variability in CGM readings even in the same person to the same food, according to its author, , a senior investigator with the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. I’d just baked banana bread with my kids, so I repeated that for breakfast a few times that week and generated a fairly consistent increase in glucose, registering a 10 on my Lingo Count one day and an 11 another. On a third day, exercising afterwards blunted my Lingo Count by a few points. Even so, my glucose never exceeded about 136 milligrams per deciliter, even at its highest after banana bread. Swapping in Greek yogurt or chia pudding appeared to avoid accumulating Lingo Counts, although I’m not sure I needed a CGM to tell me those might be better choices than banana bread for breakfast. One thing the CGM did do was nudge me to avoid snacking mindlessly, which may be the kind of small behavioral modification that can make a difference. I didn’t want to have to track every bite of graham cracker I indulged in during my kids’ afternoon snack or to see the resulting increases in glucose on my app. “I think there’s a place for it in terms of behavioral management,” said Spartano, who’s leading into whether CGMs can predict the development of diabetes as part of the . “We’re just really early in this research space.”",

    "content": "Microplastics are everywhere. They have been found on the and in creatures . They’re in , and . These tiny plastic particles choke wildlife, disrupt ecosystems, and threaten human health – and they are notoriously difficult to remove. But scientists in China have come up with a possible solution: a biodegradable sponge made of squid bones and cotton. A research team from Wuhan University used chitin from squid bones and cellulose from cotton – two organic compounds known for eliminating pollution from wastewater – to create a biodegradable sponge. They then tested the sponge in four different water samples, taken from irrigation water, pond water, lake water and sea water, and found it removed up to 99.9% of microplastics, according to a “The planet is under great threat from microplastics, and aquatic ecosystems are the first to suffer,” wrote the authors. “Even under a variety of policies, including plastic product reduction, waste management, and environmental recycling, microplastic pollution is irreversible and escalating.” Microplastics are tiny shards of plastic smaller than 5 millimeters. They come from everything from tires, which are then broken down into smaller pieces, to microbeads, a plastic found in beauty products such as exfoliants. One study from 2020 estimated there are Scientists microplastics “one of this generation’s key environmental challenges” and the problem is an environmental issue. Plastic is a persistent pollution that hurts wildlife, the ocean itself and there’s about the potential health risks it poses to humans. The problem is only set to get worse with plastic production and pollution in the coming years. Even if we embarked on an immediate and globally coordinated effort to reduce plastic consumption, an of plastic would still pollute the environment by 2040, according to another study. That makes finding solutions to get rid of the plastics contaminating our oceans all the more urgent. The sponge created by the Wuhan researchers was able to absorb microplastics both by physically intercepting them and through electromagnetic attraction, the study said. Previously studied methods for absorbing plastics tend to be expensive and difficult to make, limiting their scalability. Last year, researchers in Qingdao, China made of starch and gelatin designed to remove microplastics from water, though its efficacy varied depending on water conditions. The low cost and wide availability of both cotton and squid bones mean the sponge created in Wuhan “has great potential to be used in the extraction of microplastic from complex water bodies,” according to the study. Shima Ziajahromi, a lecturer at Australia’s Griffith University who studies microplastics, called the squid-cotton-sponge method “promising” and said it could be an effective way to “clean up the high risk and vulnerable aquatic ecosystem.” However, the study’s authors did not address whether the sponge can remove microplastics that sink to the sediment, which is the majority of microplastics in our waters, said Ziajahromi, who was not involved in the study. Another “critical issue” is the proper disposal of the sponges, Ziajahromi said. “Although the material is biodegradable, the microplastics it absorbs need to be disposed of properly,” she said. “Without careful management, this process risks transferring microplastics from one ecosystem to another.” Ultimately, Ziajahromi added, minimizing plastic pollution is in the first place should remain a “top priority.”",

    "content": ". The Parker Solar Probe zoomed by the sun on Tuesday during a record-breaking flyby, coming within 3.8 million miles (6.1 million kilometers) of the solar surface during humanity’s closest approach to a star. The mission operations team, located at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, was able to Friday morning after receiving a signal from the spacecraft just before midnight on Thursday. The mission team knew it wouldn’t receive any communications from the spacecraft during its closest pass of the sun. Now, the team members will await more detailed data from Parker about the spacecraft’s status that’s expected to return to Earth on January 1. The uncrewed spacecraft flew at 430,000 miles per hour (692,000 kilometers per hour), which is fast enough to reach Tokyo from Washington, DC, in under a minute, according to NASA. The speedy flyby would make the probe the fastest human-made object in history, the agency shared December 16 during a NASA Science Live presentation on YouTube. The mission has been building up to this historic milestone since on August 12, 2018 — an event attended by the probe’s namesake, Dr. Eugene Parker, an astrophysicist who pioneered the solar research field of heliophysics. Parker was the first living person to have a spacecraft named after him. The astrophysicist, whose research revolutionized humanity’s understanding of the sun and interplanetary space, in March 2022. But he was still able to witness how the spacecraft could help solve mysteries about the sun more than 65 years after the mission was originally envisioned. The probe became the first spacecraft to “ ” by successfully flying through the sun’s corona, or upper atmosphere, to sample particles and our star’s magnetic fields in December 2021. Over the past six years of the spacecraft’s seven-year mission, the Parker Solar Probe has collected data to enlighten scientists about some of the sun’s greatest mysteries. Heliophysicists have long wondered how the solar wind, a constant stream of particles released by the sun, is generated as well as why the sun’s corona is so much hotter than its surface. Scientists also want to understand how coronal mass ejections, or large clouds of ionized gas called plasma and magnetic fields that erupt from the sun’s outer atmosphere, are structured. When these ejections are aimed at Earth, they can cause geomagnetic storms, or major disturbances of the planet’s magnetic field, that can affect satellites as well as power and communication infrastructure on Earth. Now, the time has come for Parker’s closest and final flybys, which could complete the answers to these enduring questions and uncover new mysteries by exploring uncharted solar territory. “Parker Solar Probe is changing the field of heliophysics,” said Helene Winters, Parker Solar Probe’s project manager from Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory, in a statement. “After years of braving the heat and dust of the inner solar system, taking blasts of solar energy and radiation that no spacecraft has ever seen, Parker Solar Probe continues to thrive.” Parker’s flyby at around 6:53 a.m. ET on Christmas Eve was planned as the first of the spacecraft’s final three closest approaches, with the other two expected to occur on March 22 and June 19. The spacecraft came so close to our star that if the distance between Earth and the sun were the length of an American football field, the spacecraft would be about 4 yards from the end zone, according to NASA. At this proximity, the probe would be able to fly through plumes of plasma as well as within a solar eruption if one releases from the sun. The spacecraft was built to withstand the extremes of the sun and has flown through coronal mass ejections in the past with no impact to the vehicle, said Parker Solar Probe project scientist Nour Rawafi. The spacecraft is equipped with a carbon foam shield that is 4.5 inches (11.4 centimeters) thick and 8 feet (2.4 meters) wide. On Earth before launch, the shield was tested and able to withstand temperatures near 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (nearly 1,400 degrees Celsius). On Christmas Eve, the shield likely faced temperatures up to 1,800 F (980 degrees C), which the telemetry data expected in January will confirm. Meanwhile, the spacecraft’s interior is at a comfortable room temperature so the electronics systems and science instruments can operate as expected. A unique cooling system designed by the Applied Physics Laboratory pumps water through the craft’s solar arrays to keep them at a steady temperature of 320 F (160 C), even during close approaches to the sun. The spacecraft carried out its flyby autonomously because mission control was out of contact with the probe due to its proximity to the sun. The immense set of data and images gathered during the flyby won’t become available to mission control until Parker has moved away from the sun in its orbit, which will occur about three weeks later in mid-January, Rawafi said. Just over a year after the Parker Solar Probe first launched, the sun . Now, the sun is experiencing solar maximum, meaning that the mission has had a chance to witness most of a solar cycle and the transitions between its highs and lows, said Dr. C. Alex Young, associate director for science in the Heliophysics Science Division at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Scientists from NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the international Solar Cycle Prediction Panel announced in October that the sun has reached solar maximum, or the peak of activity within its 11-year cycle. At the peak of the solar cycle, the sun’s magnetic poles flip, causing the sun to transition from calm to active. Experts track increasing solar activity by counting how many sunspots appear on the sun’s surface. And the sun is expected to remain active for the next year or so. The sun’s increasing activity became obvious this year during two major displays of auroras on Earth in and , when coronal mass ejections released by the sun were directed at our planet. The solar storms are also responsible for generating auroras that dance around Earth’s poles, known as the northern lights, or aurora borealis, and southern lights, or aurora australis. When the energized particles from coronal mass ejections reach Earth’s magnetic field, they interact with gases in the atmosphere to create different colored light in the sky. “Both of those storms caused auroras to be visible down to the very bottom of the United States,” Young said. “But the May storm was an especially strong storm. In fact, we think it could be a 100- to possibly 500-year event, and that caused auroras very close to the equator, which is extremely unheard of. It was a worldwide event that millions and, hopefully billions, of people, were able to see, and it may not happen again.” The data gathered by Parker Solar Probe could enable scientists to better understand solar storms and even how to predict them, Young said. “The sun is the only star that we can see in detail, but we can actually go to and measure it directly,” Young said. “It’s a laboratory in our solar system that allows us to learn about all the other stars in the universe and how all those stars interact with the billions and billions of other planets that may or may not be like our own planets in our solar system.” With that in mind, Rawafi said he hopes that the sun puts on a spectacular show during the probe’s close approaches, enabling scientists to gain insights into the sun’s activity. “Sun, please do your best,” Rawafi said. “Give us the strongest event you can do, and the Parker Solar Probe can deal with it.”",

    "content": "President Donald Trump isn’t pleased with Apple CEO Tim Cook’s iPhones bound for the United States at newly built plants in India. “I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump said Thursday in Qatar. “I said to him, ‘Tim, you’re my friend. I treated you very good. You’re coming in with $500 billion.’ But now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.’” Trump has levied historic tariffs on practically all goods coming into the United States to boost domestic manufacturing, improve the balance of trade and bring in revenue to pay for his planned tax cut, among other aims. Although some companies, including Apple, have announced plans to increase production in the United States to avoid high tariffs, factories take years to build and American labor remains expensive. Corporate America can’t just flip a switch and start making everything in the United States. Trump said Apple can build in India “to take care of India” and claimed that Apple is “upping their production in the United States.” (Apple didn’t immediately respond for comment.) His comments follow Apple’s decision to shift production of iPhones sold in the United States from China to India so Apple can avoid paying higher tariffs. The company said that tariffs could add $900 million to its costs this quarter. Cook said on a call with analysts earlier this month that he expected “the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin.” Apple had working to shift some iPhone production to India for years, building new factories in the country and hiring staff. The company has no ability to produce iPhones in the United States, and, given the complexity of its supply chain, probably won’t build its most popular product in America anytime soon. Although the Trump administration is eager to get Apple to bring iPhone production here, it’s an ambition that analysts have said is nearly impossible to achieve because of high costs. The price of an iPhone could triple to $3,500 if they were made here, according to Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, Apple previously announced in February a on expanding US facilities over the next four years that would create 20,000 jobs. The investment builds on Apple’s previous efforts to expand its in recent years, partly in response to production issues in the country during the pandemic. Those investments include for Mac Pro computers in Texas.",

    "content": "Uber is launching a new service called , a carpool-like option aimed at budget-conscious commuters. Route Share will function somewhat like a commuter shuttle: “consistent and frequent pickup options along direct routes,” running every 20 minutes during the peak commute hours of 6 to 10 a.m. and 4 to 8 p.m. on weekdays. Commuters will walk a “short distance” to designated pickup and drop-off points, and they may share rides with up to two additional passengers, Uber said in its announcement Wednesday. The service will launch in seven major cities, including New York City, San Francisco and Chicago, before expanding nationwide. Uber says Route Share will save commuters up to 50% compared to the private-ride UberX service — notably higher than the existing UberPool pooled rides option, which is an average 20% savings, the company’s says. The company is also rolling out two new ride passes aimed at reducing costs for riders. The Price Lock Pass, launching Wednesday in select cities for $2.99 a month, lets users lock in a price in advance for up to 10 routes. And a Prepaid Pass launching this summer will offer discounts on bundles of five, ten, 15 or 20 rides paid in advance. The announcements come one week after Uber’s quarterly earnings call, on which Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the company is focused on serving price-sensitive riders — while also boosting usage during peak commute hours. The new features also align with the company’s broader goal of , giving Uber another way to serve its core market of commuting city dwellers. Meanwhile Uber is leaning on other offerings like Uber Reserve — a feature that allows riders to schedule a trip up to 90 days in advance — to expand in the suburbs. Khosrowshahi said in his prepared earnings remarks that the company is seeing suburban customers “increasingly turn to Reserve as the primary way they use Uber.” For the city dwellers, Route Share will allow riders the flexibility to book a seat anywhere from ten minutes to seven days in advance. Uber is exploring partnerships to make the service eligible for pretax commuter benefits, another factor that could make it appealing to the 9-5 crowd. The move builds on Uber’s previous budget-friendly efforts such as which launched last year and lets riders book up to five seats for group rides to events or the airport at a lower price. It also comes as has recently fallen to its lowest level since May 2020, meaning commuters could be looking to spend less on transportation.",

    "content": "If you search “Adderall” on Spotify’s podcast page, you’ll find health podcasts about ADHD, shows about addiction recovery and comedy podcasts where hosts talk about using the medication. You may also come across multiple pages masquerading as podcasts that direct users to buy drugs from potentially dangerous and illegal online pharmacies. The intention of many of these pages is obvious from their names. Podcasts with titles, such as “My Adderall Store” — which has a link in the episode description to a site that purportedly sells Adderall, as well as potentially addictive pain medications like Oxycodone and Vicodin, among other drugs — were listed within the first 50 suggested results, a CNN review this week found. CNN identified dozens of these fake podcasts across Spotify, advertising sales of medications ranging from Methadone to Ambien, in some cases claiming that the drugs can be purchased without a prescription, which is illegal in the United States. Spotify is now scrambling to remove these fake podcast pages, which violate its and which, at best, may be spam and, and worst, could direct users to sites that violate the law. Within hours after CNN sent Spotify a list of 26 podcasts promoting online pharmacies that were live as of Thursday afternoon, the platform had removed them. A spokesperson said they violated its rules, which prohibit illegal and spam content. Still, even after Spotify removed the podcasts CNN sent on Thursday, others continued to appear on the platform Friday morning. “We are constantly working to detect and remove violating content across our service,” a Spotify spokesperson told CNN in a statement. The findings come as have urged to crack down on the sale of counterfeit or illicit drugs to young people through their platforms, after from They also raise questions about Spotify’s moderation capabilities as AI makes it easier than ever to churn out fake content. Lauren Balik, who runs a blog about tech company stocks, called on Spotify CEO Daniel Ek to address the fake podcast issue in a on X earlier this week. Business Insider also published on the issue on Thursday that said it flagged hundreds of the podcasts that Spotify subsequently removed. Multiple US have that ordering medications from online pharmacies may be illegal and could have harmful — and potentially deadly — consequences. In 2011, Google was fined $500 million for running ads for Canadian online pharmacies illegally selling prescription drugs to US consumers, after which the internet giant took to combat online pharmacies appearing in ads or search results. And in 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration , including Facebook, Reddit and Twitter (now called X), to do more to prevent illegal opioid sales on their sites. Still, tech platforms that host content pointing users to those sites, are largely subject to “a lack of any repercussions, any accountability,” according to Katie Paul, director of the non-profit Tech Transparency Project. That’s because federal law generally protects tech platforms from liability over what users post on their sites. “There’s no regulations,” Paul added. Even after the issue was called to Spotify’s attention, CNN was easily able to find dozens of these fake, drug sales podcast pages, including some that had been posted on the platform for months. One such podcast, called “Xtrapharma.com,” posted eight episodes, each less than 10-seconds long, on November 29, 2024. The episodes featured a computerized voice advertising Xanax, Percocet, Oxycontin or Hydrocodone for sale “with FDA-approved delivery without prescription.” “Our platform provides a seamless experience for those seeking solid medications like Xanax,” the Xtrapharma.com podcast description on Spotify read. “With just a few clicks, you can avail yourself of this trusted medication from the comfort of your home, ensuring discretion and convenience while prioritizing your mental health needs.” Another podcast titled “Order Xanax 2 mg Online Big Deal On Christmas Season” posted its only episode on December 2 last year. In the 26-second episode, a computerized voice said, “Are you a health-conscious guy? Presenting the best health advisor episode first time on Spotify,” before describing Xanax. Its description linked users to an online pharmacy that claims to deliver “Government approved medicine to the customer’s doorstep.” The proliferation of text-to-speech tools has made it easier and faster to create large volumes of this kind of spammy content. “I think podcasts have a bigger blind spot, because … voice makes it much more difficult for moderation,” Paul told CNN. One Spotify podcast titled “John Elizabeth,” with thumbnail art advertising a pharmacy website, had dozens of episodes featuring a voice that sounds computer-generated. The website advertised was the same as that promoted on another podcast, called My Adderall Store. “If you’re in search of Ativan for sale online with fast delivery, you’re in luck,” the voice said in one episode of the show. “Our online store offers a hassle-free shopping experience, making it easy for you to get the medication you need without any trouble.” On an initial CNN search of Spotify podcasts for “Adderall,” at least seven podcasts advertising online pharmacies showed up within the first 100 results. On a search for “Xanax,” 20 of the first 60 results promoted online pharmacies. And on a search for “Valium,” two of the first five suggested results were promoting online pharmacies. Fake podcasts also surfaced in searches for “Vyvanse,” “Codeine” and “Percocet,” such as a show titled “How Percocet Dosage Taken No RX” with episodes like “Order Codeine Online Safe Pharmacy Louisiana” that linked to an online pharmacy along with a coupon code. None of the drug sales podcasts that CNN viewed had been rated by users on the platform, so it’s not clear how many people may have viewed or interacted with them. CNN could not confirm if orders placed through these sites would actually be delivered. In some cases, after CNN engaged with these podcasts — including one called “Adderall 10 mg blue pills” — the site appeared to remove them; links to the shows redirected to a page saying, “Sorry, that’s not currently available.” However, more than two dozen others remained active until CNN asked Spotify about them. Spotify offers free tools that allow anyone to create, distribute and, potentially, monetize podcasts. However, it notes in its that its mission to “democratize audio” doesn’t mean “anything goes on our platform.” Those guidelines prohibit, for example, hateful content, sexually explicit content, illegal content and spam, including content made “solely to … promote a product or service.” The platform says it may remove content that violates those creator guidelines. “Mass publishing identical or indistinguishable content that directs listeners to potentially harmful sites or services, or violates our monetization policies,” Spotify said in the guidelines. Separately, Spotify’s also prohibit “content that illicitly promotes the sale of regulated or illegal goods,” including illegal drugs. It says it uses both automated technology and human reviewers to enforce its rules. Spotify has previously been criticized over health-related content on the platform. In 2022, several prominent artists or pulled their music catalogues from the site, in protest of its popular podcast “The Joe Rogan Experience,” which had repeatedly spread false claims about vaccines and the pandemic. In response, Spotify to all podcast episodes that discuss Covid, directing users to trusted sources. (Rogan also to do more thorough research and provide more balanced information about Covid.) The company continued to ramp up its moderation efforts following that 2022 debacle, including establishing a to provide feedback on Spotify’s rules and enforcement. It also , a machine learning startup capable of screening audio content for rules violations. But online safety experts say the fake podcasts are a sign that Spotify needs to do more to protect its platform. “What’s true is that anywhere people can post user-generated content, you will find … people selling drugs,” said Sarah Gardner, CEO of the , a non-profit that advocates for child safety online. “That part is, unfortunately, pretty consistent.

    "content": "In recent years, people ranging from Taylor Swift and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to high school girls around the country have been — images where a person’s face is superimposed on a nude body using artificial intelligence. Now, after months of outcry, there is finally a federal law criminalizing the sharing of those images. President Donald Trump signed the Take It Down Act in a ceremony at the White House on Monday. In addition to making it to illegal to share online nonconsensual, explicit images — real or computer-generated — the law also requires tech platforms to remove such images within 48 hours of being notified about them. The law will boost protections for victims of revenge porn and nonconsensual, AI-generated sexual images, increase accountability for the tech platforms where the content is shared and provide law enforcement with clarity about how to prosecute such activity. Previously, creating or sharing realistic, AI-generated explicit images of children. But laws protecting adult victims varied by state and didn’t exist nationwide. The Take It Down Act also represents one of the first new US federal laws aimed at addressing the potential harms from AI-generated content as the technology rapidly advances. “AI is new to a lot of us and so I think we’re still figuring out what is helpful to society, what is harmful to society, but (non-consensual) intimate deepfakes are such a clear harm with no benefit,” said Ilana Beller, organizing manager at progressive advocacy group Public Citizen, which endorsed the legislation. The law passed both chambers of Congress nearly unanimously, with only two House representatives dissenting, in a rare moment of bipartisan consensus. More than , including non-profits and big tech companies such as Meta, TikTok and Google, also supported the legislation. First lady Melania Trump threw her support behind the effort, too, lobbying House lawmakers in April to pass the legislation. And the president referenced the bill during his address to a joint session of Congress in March, during which the first lady hosted as one of her guests. Berry attended the bill signing event at the White House’s Rose Garden on Monday, along with , another teen who has pushed for legal protections after she was targeted by this form of harassment. “Today, through the Take It Down Act, we affirm that the wellbeing of our children is central to our future of our families in America,” the first lady said Monday. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar first introduced the legislation last summer. Months earlier, a classmate of Texas high schooler Berry shared on Snapchat an image of her that he’d taken from her Instagram and altered using AI to make it look like she was nude. Berry wasn’t alone — teen girls in and elsewhere have also been subject to this form of harassment. “Everyday I’ve had to live with the fear of these photos getting brought up or resurfacing,” Berry told CNN last year, in an interview about her support for the Take It Down Act. “By this bill getting passed, I will no longer have to live in fear, knowing that whoever does bring these images up will be punished.” Facing increased pressure over the issue, some major tech platforms had taken steps to make it easier for victims to have nonconsensual sexual images removed from their sites. Some big tech platforms, including , and , already have forms where users can request the removal of explicit images. And others have partnered with non-profit organizations and that facilitate the removal of such images across multiple platforms at once, although not all sites cooperate with the groups. Apple and Google have also made efforts to remove AI services that convert clothed images into manipulated nude ones from their app stores and search results. Still, bad actors will often seek out platforms that aren’t taking action to prevent harmful uses of their technology, underscoring the need for the kind of legal accountability that the Take It Down Act will provide. “This legislation finally compels social media bros to do their jobs and protect women from highly intimate and invasive breaches of their rights,” Imran Ahmed, CEO of the non-profit Center for Countering Digital Hate, said in a statement to CNN. “While no legislation is a silver bullet, the status quo—where young women face horrific harms online—is unacceptable.” Public Citizen’s Beller added that it’s also “important to signal as a society that this is unacceptable.” “If our federal law is passing a law that says, this is unacceptable and here are the consequences, that sends a clear signal,” she said.",

    "content": "The very basic meaning of what it means to ” Google” something – typing in keywords and sifting through links, images and information snippets is nearly behind us, according to Google. The search giant laid out its vision for the future of searching the web on Tuesday, introducing a flurry of updates that aim to shift Google’s ubiquitous search engine from being a box for processing keywords to a system of “digital agents” that can crawl the web and answer questions based on a person’s real-world surroundings, tastes and preferences. Google’s AI push comes as publishers – – have already raised concerns about how the prominence of AI-generated answers could threaten their businesses. The announcements, made during the company’s annual developer conference, underscore that Google’s most important business is facing more competition than ever. Chatbots like ChatGPT and AI-fueled search engines such as Perplexity present an alternative way to find information and get things done – two tasks firmly at the center of Google’s core business. The newly announced tools can be seen as an effort to prove its nearly 30-year-old search engine isn’t losing relevance in the AI era. “What all this progress tells me is that we are now entering a new phase of the AI platform shift, where decades of research are now becoming reality for people, businesses and communities all over the world,” Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and its parent company Alphabet, said in a press briefing ahead of the conference. Google is broadening AI Mode, previously only available to those who signed up to test early features through its Labs program, to all US users through the Google app. It’s a step beyond AI Overviews, the AI-generated answers consumers see at the top of results. The primary difference between AI Mode and a standard Google search is the way it processes queries. Instead of just looking at the whole question, AI Mode breaks queries down into subtopics and generates additional searches based on those subtopics to provide a more specific answer. Google says AI Mode will soon draw on a person’s search history to further personalize answers, and users will also be able to link it to other Google apps, like Gmail. Beyond how it processes questions, AI Mode is expected to offer two key new ways of searching: one that it claims will handle tasks on a user’s behalf, and another that lets them show Google their surroundings using their phone’s camera. Although AI Mode is now generally available in the US, these two specific features will still require users to sign up for Labs. Google’s Project Mariner technology, which the company announced as a research prototype last year, will be able to accomplish certain tasks on a person’s behalf and answer questions that usually require multiple steps, the company claims. For example, one could ask a question such as “Find two affordable tickets for this Sunday’s Reds game in the lower level,” and Google will search for tickets, analyze options and pricing, fill out forms autonomously and then pull up tickets that match the user’s criteria. It will initially be available for buying tickets, making restaurant reservations and booking local appointments through services such as Ticketmaster, StubHub, Resy and Vagaro, and will come to the Labs section of the Google app in the coming months. AI Mode in the Google app is also getting a new feature that lets users ask questions about the world around them. Visual search isn’t new to Google; the company’s Lens tool already lets users ask questions about photos they’ve snapped. But this mode takes that idea a step further by showing Google what a person is seeing in real time. The idea is to make it easier for Google to answer questions about complex tasks that are difficult to describe – such as whether the specific bolt in the toolbox is the right size for the bike frame being fixed – just by pointing a phone at it and asking. Google previously brought this visual search functionality to its Gemini assistant on Android, which it’s now expanding to the iPhone. But Tuesday’s announcement shows Google sees it as being key to the future of its search engine as well. Some of the new search capabilities overlap with those available in Google’s Gemini assistant, potentially causing confusion among consumers. Robby Stein, vice president of product for Google search, told CNN that search is tailored for learning, while Gemini is meant to be a helper for tasks like generating code and writing business plans in addition to answering questions. Google’s search engine has been the primary vessel for finding information online for nearly three decades. But that position is being challenged more than ever due to the proliferation of AI services from companies like OpenAI and Perplexity, as well as fellow tech stalwarts like Apple, Amazon and Microsoft – all of which have upgraded or are in the process of upgrading their virtual assistants with advanced AI capabilities. OpenAI, Google’s chief rival in the AI assistant space, has launched its own search engine. Google’s increased competition became evident earlier this month when Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of services, revealed in courtroom testimony that Google searches in its Safari browser in April had decreased for the first time since 2002, reported. Google on that statement, saying it’s seen “overall query growth in search” including those coming from Apple devices. Market research firm estimated last year that search engine volume would drop 25% by 2026 as consumers gravitate toward AI tools. But Pichai, on a call with reporters, said the updates reflect the new ways people are using his company’s search engine. “When I look ahead, you’ve got glimpses of a proactive world, an agentic world,” he said. “All of this will keep getting better.”",

    "content": "Tech firm Workday is facing a collective action lawsuit alleging that its job applicant screening technology is discriminatory, following an order by a California district judge on Friday. The outcome could set a precedent for whether and how companies can use algorithms and artificial intelligence to make hiring decisions, as companies increasingly adopt the technology. Last year, a man named Derek Mobley sued the human resources software company claiming that Workday’s algorithms caused him to be rejected from more than 100 jobs on the platform over seven years because of his age, race and disabilities. Four other plaintiffs have since joined with age discrimination allegations. Together, the plaintiffs, all over the age of 40, claim that they submitted hundreds of job applications through Workday and were rejected each time — sometimes within minutes or hours. They blame Workday’s algorithm, which they claim “disproportionately disqualifies individuals over the age of forty (40) from securing gainful employment” when it screens and ranks applicants, court documents state. Judge Rita Lin’s Friday preliminary order will allow the case to proceed as a collective action suit — similar to a class action. AI tools can help HR professionals manage the influx of hundreds of applications they receive — some of which may have been created using AI. But experts worry about the technology deciding which candidates are “most qualified” because AI can contain biases that may prevent people from getting hired based on their age, gender, race or other characteristics. The American Civil Liberties Union, for example, has that AI hiring tools “pose an enormous danger of exacerbating existing discrimination in the workplace.” In one prominent case in 2018, an automated job candidate ranking tool after it found the system favored male applicants over women. Still, Workday has denied the claims that its technology is discriminatory. In a statement, a Workday spokesperson noted that the Friday order is a “preliminary, procedural ruling … that relies on allegations, not evidence.” “We continue to believe this case is without merit,” the spokesperson said. “We’re confident that once Workday is permitted to defend itself with the facts, the plaintiff’s claims will be dismissed.” Used by over 11,000 organizations worldwide, Workday provides a platform for companies to post open jobs, recruit candidates and manage the hiring process; millions of open jobs are listed with its technology each month. It also offers a service called “HiredScore AI,” which it says uses “responsible AI” to grade top candidates and cut down the time recruiters spend screening applications. In a court filing opposing the lawsuit’s allegations, Workday claims that it does not screen prospective employees for customers and that its technology does not make hiring decisions. But Mobley claims that he was rejected time and again — often without being offered an interview — despite having graduated cum laude from Morehouse College and his nearly decade of experience in financial, IT and customer service jobs. In one instance, he submitted a job application at 12:55 a.m. and received a rejection notice less than an hour later at 1:50 a.m., according to court documents. Another plaintiff, Jill Hughes, said she similarly received automated rejections for hundreds of roles “often received within a few hours of applying or at odd times outside of business hours … indicating a human did not review the applications,” court documents state. In some cases, she claims those rejection emails erroneously stated that she did not meet the minimum requirements for the role. “Algorithmic decision-making and data analytics are not, and should not be assumed to be, race neutral, disability neutral, or age neutral,” Mobley’s original complaint states. “Too often, they reinforce and even exacerbate historical and existing discrimination.” Experts say AI hiring tools can demonstrate bias even if companies never instruct them to favor certain categories of people over others. These systems are often trained on the resumes or profiles of existing employees — but if a company’s existing workforce is largely male or white, the technology could inadvertently infer that the most successful candidates should share those characteristics. Hilke Schellmann, author of the book “The Algorithm” about the use of AI in hiring, who is not involved in the Workday lawsuit, recounted a situation in which a different resume evaluation tool awarded more points to resumes with the word “baseball” over ones that listed “softball.” “It was some random job that had nothing to do with sports and probably what happens is that of the resumes the parser analyzed, maybe there were a bunch of people who had ‘baseball’ on their resume and the tool did a statistical analysis and found out, yeah, it’s totally significant,” Schellmann said on CNN’s Terms of Service podcast earlier this year. The AI “wouldn’t understand, ‘wait a second, baseball has nothing to do with the job,’” she said. Mobley’s complaint alleges that Workday’s technology works in a similar way. “If Workday’s algorithmic decision-making tools observe that a client-employer disfavors certain candidates who are members of a protected class, it will decrease the rate at which it recommends those candidates,” the complaint states. Lin’s Friday order will allow Mobley’s lawyers to notify other people who may have similar discrimination claims against Workday and allow them to join the suit. However, Workday can still ask the court to handle the claims individually, rather than as a group. The lawsuit is seeking unspecified monetary damages, as well as a court order requiring the company to change its practices.",

    "content": "OpenAI and Nvidia will join other companies to build Stargate UAE, an artificial intelligence infrastructure cluster, in a sister project to the recently unveiled push to expand AI infrastructure in the United States. Appearing alongside President Donald Trump in January, the CEOs of OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle they would create a new company, called Stargate, to build out AI infrastructure in the US. The companies said they plan to invest up to $500 billion into the project in the coming years. On Thursday, those three companies, as well as Nvidia, Cisco and local champion G42, announced in a statement their partnership to build Stargate UAE in Abu Dhabi. The project’s first part, a 200-megawatt AI “cluster,” is expected to go live in 2026, they said. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, said in the statement that the project in the oil-rich United Arab Emirates is “a step toward ensuring some of this era’s most important breakthroughs – safer medicines, personalized learning and modernized energy – can emerge from more places and benefit the world.” In a separate on its website, OpenAI said Stargate UAE has the potential to provide AI infrastructure and computing capacity within a 2,000-mile radius, reaching up to half the world’s population. The project, agreed in close coordination with the US government, is the first international deployment of , OpenAI’s AI infrastructure platform, the company also noted. For his part, Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, said the project in the UAE would “power the country’s bold vision – to empower its people, grow its economy and shape its future.” G42 will build the facility, with OpenAI and Oracle operating it, while Nvidia will provide some of the most advanced chips available. Stargate UAE will run in the recently announced data center complex in Abu Dhabi, which will have 5 gigawatts of capacity – enough to power a major city. The complex will be built by the US and the UAE, Trump last week during his visit to the country, and will eventually span 10 square miles.",

    "content": "When a deal to buy Caitlin Bigelow’s San Francisco condo fell through last month, she felt relief, rather than disappointment. Bigelow was working with a real estate agent she trusted from Compass who had suggested she first list her home as a “Compass Private Exclusive.” That meant her home wouldn’t immediately be publicly advertised on home-search websites like Zillow or Redfin. Instead, the listing would be announced internally at Compass, one of America’s largest real estate brokerages, meaning only buyers represented by other Compass agents knew the home was for sale. Bigelow had received two offers from this method — including one for $2.1 million, which was $95,000 over her list price. It was the “magic number” she had in mind, and she quickly accepted. At first, she was thrilled. But after having time to think, she began to feel a sense of unease. “Only two people had seen (the home) and we seemed to be hitting our magic number already,” Bigelow told CNN. “The longer I sat with that, the more I felt like, well, if two people saw it and we hit the number, what if 50 people saw it?” Bigelow’s question gets at the heart of a dispute roiling the residential real estate industry. After last year by the industry’s powerful trade association, the National Association of Realtors, the battle over private and exclusive listings has become the latest fight about the way homes are bought and sold in America. There are legitimate reasons why someone might list their home out of the public eye, Summer Goralik, a real estate compliance consultant, told CNN. For example, celebrities and other public figures may not want to advertise their home’s address or photos. But with US homebuyer demand over the last few years, private listings across the market could mean only select buyers get first dibs on in-demand homes. Although Compass is not the only brokerage that lists homes off-market, the practice has become a of how its agents market home listings. And it has prompted backlash: Other leaders in the residential real estate industry argue the practice is exclusionary and threatens to further chip away at consumer trust in real estate agents. “If a portion of inventory is removed and only shown to a small group of people, by definition, that’s an exclusionary behavior that’s going to hurt others,” said Leo Pareja, the CEO of eXp Realty, another one of America’s largest real estate brokerages. He said his company only handles private transactions when it’s required in special situations: “Fewer than 1,000 transactions for us last year were private exclusives out of 350,000.” Critics also say the private listing strategy unfairly pushes home sellers to make deals with buyers represented by other Compass agents, resulting in the brokerage collecting a commission from both sides of the transaction. Compass has denied the accusation that it pushes sellers into private transactions. Instead, the company said many sellers choose to list their homes privately before sharing their homes more widely on the multiple listing service (MLS), which is a database that agents from all companies use to share home listings with each other. Most MLS listings are automatically picked up by homebuying websites like Zillow and Redfin. “Home sellers deserve choice in how their home is marketed,” a Compass spokesperson wrote to CNN in a statement. “They should be able to choose the best strategy for selling their homes, whether that means starting with marketing privately or publicly before listing in the MLS or listing on the MLS from day one.” Compass often employs its “ ” for home sellers. It begins with a private listing to “test” a home’s sales price. Then, during the “coming soon” phase, listings are showcased on Compass’ website to generate buyer interest before they “officially” hit the market. The final phase is to “go live on all platforms,” meaning sellers list their home online for all real estate agents and home shoppers. As of mid-February, approximately 35% of all Compass’ listings were listed as “Compass Private Exclusive” or “Compass Coming Soon,” CEO Robert Reffkin said on Compass’ most recent earnings call. Compass 94% of its private listings last year ultimately sold on the public market. “If this plan to market off the MLS is literally driven by client need, then 100% that should be the journey,” Goralik said. “But on the flip side, if it’s not driven by the seller, and the listing pitch is about why your property needs to be off the MLS before that discussion even comes up… that just dirties the water all the way through.” An increasingly fragmented housing market where buyers can only find certain homes for sale depending on their agent hurts both buyers and sellers, Goralik told CNN. “Then that wasn’t the seller’s choice. That wasn’t even directed by the seller,” she added. “I just think that’s going backwards. That’s not moving toward the future.” Last week, Ryan Schneider, CEO of Anywhere Real Estate, which includes real estate companies such as Coldwell Banker, Century 21 and Sotheby’s International Realty, weighed in on the dispute on his company’s earnings call last week. “Anywhere Real Estate is aggressively advocating for transparency and the broad and public distribution of nearly all listings because we believe it is best for buyers to see all the inventory, and most critically, it helps sellers get the highest price for their home,” he said on Tuesday. In April, though, Corcoran, another subsidiary of Anywhere Real Estate, rolled out , a private listing network for sellers who want to prioritize “greater privacy and discretion.” “We are advocating for the broad distribution of listings in almost all cases, and we don’t believe that this self-serving debate has the best interests of the consumer at heart,” Anywhere Real Estate said in a statement to CNN a few weeks after Corcoran Reserve was launched. Douglas Elliman, a separate brokerage, plans to roll out its own private listing network, though the company told CNN that it is just one of multiple selling strategies for home sellers. Pareja has been vocal in his opposition of private listings. “If I were being a pure capitalist, I would be on the other side of the argument, because I would be able to hoard inventory…. But I’m not. Instead, I’m saying, ‘Hey guys, this is not good for the consumer,’” he told CNN. Last month, and Redfin — two of the most popular platforms for home sale searches — announced new rules that complicate Compass’ strategy. While it doesn’t directly prohibit private listings, Zillow said that a home listing that is marketed to consumers must be published to Zillow within one day, or it won’t be published at all. Beginning in late May, “coming soon” listings that are advertised on other real estate websites will need to be published on Zillow within 24 hours. Redfin announced a similar policy shortly afterward. Reffkin has defended the strategy of keeping listings off platforms like Zillow and Redfin to start. Both sites publicly show price cut history and how many days homes sit on the market — two data points the Compass CEO has argued hurt a home’s sales price. “Compass has achieved everything it has without banning homeowners who don’t give us their listings,” one of Reffkin’s recent social media posts read. “Why can’t Zillow and Redfin do that same?” Compass has pushed back on the notion that its private listings are designed to increase the chance that the brokerage would collect the commission on both sides of a home transaction; rather, they say they are following the rules set by NAR. In 2020, NAR implemented a rule for its 1.5 million members that requires agents to put a listing on the MLS within one day after marketing it, meaning that Compass agents had not been allowed to broadcast private listings to other brokerages without triggering the one-day rule. In March, NAR , now allowing sellers to list their homes in more private ways, including the option to delay the public marketing of homes on the MLS. “This new listing option is simply another choice for consumers who want greater control over how and where their property is marketed,” a statement from NAR said. On Thursday, Reffkin announced a new plan to share Compass’ private listings with other brokerages while still following NAR’s rules: Agents from all brokerages can now come into any Compass office and view the brokerage’s private listings on a one-on-one basis in a physical book, Reffkin said. Bigelow, the seller in San Francisco, said she didn’t feel pushed by her Compass real estate agent into the decision to privately list her home. Her agent told her it would be a good way to test out listing her home above $2 million, since there were very few comparable homes in the area that had sold at that price. She agreed with the strategy. Plus, her agent told her that Compass private listings are blasted out to all Compass agents, which could improve her home’s visibility. But, in hindsight, she now believes accepting an offer before her home’s listing was available to the public was a mistake. After her condo’s initial “private” buyer fell through, Bigelow worked with the same Compass real estate agent to list her home on the MLS and Zillow. Six days and around 60 showings later, Bigelow had multiple offers and ultimately netted $100,000 more than she would have received had the initial private offer gone through. “I think that the off-market exclusive ultimately is bad for people and good for Compass,” Bigelow said. However, if she could do it all again, Bigelow said she would still begin her home sales process by listing privately. “I would still publish off-market, because then all the Compass agents get notified about it. I just wouldn’t accept any offers during that period,” she said.",

    "content": "In early April, Wall Street threw a temper tantrum that would make a toddler proud. Fearing President Donald Trump’s chaotic trade war would ignite a global recession, investors scrambled to dump US assets. The rare simultaneous selloff of both reflected a serious loss of confidence in White House policy. Then The president paused so-called “reciprocal tariffs” for 90 days and , though many items than before the Trump administration. US stocks reversed course, too, setting off a historic rally on Wall Street in the past month. The S&P 500 has now and gained nearly $8 trillion in market value since its April 8 lows. It’s a remarkable comeback that underscores palpable relief among investors and since Trump’s stunning reversal. “The markets had a tantrum and stomped their collective feet and got what they wanted: Trump to back off,” Ed Yardeni, president of investment advisory Yardeni Research, told CNN in a phone interview. “Trump realized he was toying around with liquid nitroglycerine and that it was time to back off.” The early 2025 selloff was breathtaking in its speed and intensity. It took just 22 days for the S&P 500 to close in correction territory, a from its record highs in November — a fraction of the time it normally takes to get a correction, according to CFRA Research. The S&P 500 narrowly avoided . “It was a free-fall moment,” said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab. “Investor sentiment got to panic levels.” The recovery has been just as swift, the fastest since 1982. It took 25 trading days to go to positive territory from down 15% on the year, according to Bespoke Investment Group. In times of gloomy sentiment, investors might spark speedy rebounds when they finally see a situation change. “Investors think the worst is likely over and that the reason for the panic has largely been undone,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The whipsaw action in markets underscores how hard it is for even the smartest minds on Wall Street to time markets. And why Nathan Rothschild , “The time to buy is when there’s blood in the streets.” The of market sentiment signaled “extreme fear” among investors in April, crashing to three on a scale of one to 100. The gauge has since completely rebounded and is now in “greed” territory (and heading toward “extreme greed”). The tech sector has largely led the rally after the Trump administration’s and other electronics from country-specific tariffs. Apple ( ) and Amazon ( ) stocks have surged more than 20% apiece since the April 8 low. Nvidia ( ) has spiked more than 40%. But the upswing goes broader than tech. Consumer discretionary, industrials, communication services and financials have all rallied on Wall Street in the past month. Each time tariffs have been dialed back, forecasters have cut their odds of a recession. The chance of a US recession is now less than 50%, according to JPMorgan Chase economists’ forecast, down from 60% in early April before Trump’s 90-day pause on country-specific tariffs. Goldman Sachs now sees a 35% chance of a recession, down from 45% before the US-China breakthrough on trade. And recession chances on prediction platform have plunged from 66% to 39%. “There was a tremendous amount of anxiety about Trump’s tariffs causing turmoil and uncertainty and increasing the likelihood of a recession, not just in the US but on a global basis,” Yardeni said, adding that “Trump couldn’t afford to let this issue fester.” And the odds of a recession don’t have to be zero for investors to pile back into stocks. “If zero is knowing nothing and 10 is knowing everything, Wall Street nibbles at 3 and does full-blown buying at 5,” said Stovall. Of course, the US economy is not out of danger. US tariffs have still skyrocketed, just not as high as a few weeks ago. The average effective tariff rate stands at 17.8%, the , according to The Budget Lab at Yale. US tariffs on China are no longer at 145%, but they’re still elevated at 30%. That’s low enough to unfreeze trade but high enough to still cause price increases. And no one knows exactly how those still-high tariffs will hit the US economy – “This is still relatively extreme trade policy,” said Schwab’s Gordon. The White House argues the economic damage will be minimal. Many economists expect a burst of inflation and job loss, though the magnitude is very much up for debate. The rapid recovery has spurred other investor concerns, and some worry the stock market rally is overextended. “The market has raced from oversold to overbought in record time,” Mark Hackett, chief market strategist at Nationwide, wrote in a note on Wednesday. “That limits near-term upside unless we see a clear reacceleration in growth.” Hackett said that without stronger growth and earnings, it will be difficult for US stocks to break out to new highs. UBS warned on Wednesday that economic data is “poised to soften” in the coming months and that, in turn, US stocks could face a “modest headwind.” The bank has downgraded its stance on US stocks from “attractive” to “neutral,” cautioning that much of the good news has already been priced in and challenging news is likely on the way. And a powerful rally does not guarantee the worst is over. CFRA’s Stovall notes that in two-thirds of all bear markets since World War II, the S&P 500 ultimately made even lower lows after recovering from double-digit percentage declines. “There is still an awful lot of uncertainty out there. We have to wait and see if this rally has legs,” Stovall said. The biggest X-factor is Trump himself and his evolving trade agenda. Markets remain one all-caps Truth Social post away from either a meltdown or a ferocious rally. “This was a manufactured correction,” said Stovall, “and it could be remanufactured if the president wants to change his mind about things.”",

    "content": "Wall Street is on edge about American investments again after receiving a significant warning about the safest of all safe havens: US debt. Moody’s on Friday evening from its previously perfect AAA credit rating, the last of the three major credit rating agencies to strip US Treasuries of their flawless reputation. Explaining its rationale for lowering its credit rating on the United States for the first time since 1917, Moody’s cited ballooning US debt levels and Washington’s intransigence over budget deficit solutions. US ended the day slightly higher Monday after initially falling: The Dow was up by 137 points, or 0.3%. The broader S&P 500 rose by 0.09% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was 0.02% higher. Investors sold off US Treasuries. The benchmark 10-year yield, which trades in opposite direction to its price, rose near 4.5%, and the 30-year yield was just under 5% after initially crossing that threshold earlier in the day. The US dollar tumbled 0.6% against a basket of currencies. Meanwhile, gold, a traditional safe haven, rose 1.5% to $3,232 a troy ounce. Investors in American assets have been on a roller coaster ride this year. Initial excitement over President Donald Trump’s business-friendly and tax-cut policies sent stocks surging to a record high in mid-February. But that fervor soon gave way to extreme fear over Trump’s trade policy, sending investors pouring out of American assets in what market observers called the . That sent bonds and the dollar tumbling and stocks an inch away from a bear market in April. In mid-April, however, a pause in trade tensions renewed faith in American investments and sent stocks and bonds surging again. But then came Friday’s debt downgrade. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent attempted to reassure market participants that the credit rating downgrade was built on outdated information, echoing the refrain from former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who said something similar when Fitch Ratings downgrade America’s debt rating in 2023. Bessent on Sunday that he “does not put much credence in the Moody’s” downgrade. When pressed by CNN’s Jake Tapper about whether Trump’s “one, big, beautiful bill” tax cut proposal would further exacerbate America’s debt crisis by reducing revenue, Bessent said the bill would grow America’s economy to lower its surging debt-to-gross-domestic-product ratio. America’s debt-to-GDP ratio was 92% in the second quarter of 2011 when S&P became the first credit-rating agency to downgrade US debt. It is , according to the US Treasury. But market analysts say Moody’s downgrade could send shockwaves through Wall Street again. Citigroup in a note to investors Monday said the notch below perfect “makes little if any difference” to investors. “We do think this comes at a bad time for sentiment, with both fiscal space moving in the wrong direction (due to lower tariffs) and the potential fiscal impulse increasing,” Citi analysts said. They also warned this could become America’s “Liz Truss moment” if Washington isn’t careful, cutting taxes to juice the economy at the exact wrong time. Some other analysts concurred. “Budget-busting revenue estimates for the big, beautiful bill down in Washington appear to be the problem,” said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds. “When S&P first tried this US downgrade also late on a Friday, on August 5, 2011, it was quite a shock.” Rupkey noted stocks fell nearly 7% the Monday after America’s first downgrade, but the reaction was far more muted when Fitch downgraded the debt 12 years later. Debt hawks said Moody’s downgrade should serve as a warning about America’s unsustainable debt load. “For those looking for a signpost to tell us when to stop adding to our national debt, they should look no further than Moody‘s downgrade,” said Michael Peterson, CEO of the Peter Peterson Foundation, which advocates for America’s fiscal stability. “It’s unacceptable for a great country like America to harm its own credit rating.” If Wall Street returns to “sell America,” it . In the late winter and early spring, investors took money out of US stocks and even traditional safe havens like government bonds, pouring them into gold and foreign stocks. Treasury yields, which trade in the opposite direction to prices, surged. And spot gold prices rose above $3,000 a troy ounce for the first time in history in March. Traders grew increasingly concerned that Trump’s policies could inflict serious damage on the economy. Despite Trump’s insistence that stocks were falling because of the inflationary problems inherited from former President Joe Biden, the market had boomed after Trump’s November election in hopes that his promised tax cuts and deregulation would fuel another economic boom. But Trump in the months before he took office began on America’s biggest trading partners. The Dow, which was near its record high when Trump started posting messages on Truth Social about tariffs on November 25, hit one more record high a week later and then tumbled. The S&P 500 fell nearly 20% between its mid-February all-time-high and Trump’s April 9 pause of his April 2 “Liberation Day” tariffs. Now, investors have at least one more thing to worry about: America’s out-of-control debt. But they may have to fret about the trade war once again. Bessent on Sunday told CNN that if dozens of countries that had been hit with Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs fail to reach a trade deal with the administration, they’ll face tariffs as high as 50%, the same tariffs Trump unveiled at his “Liberation Day” announcement. “President Trump has put them on notice that if you do not negotiate in good faith, you will ratchet back up to your April 2 level,” Bessent said.",

    "content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says the full effects of tariffs have yet to be felt and that markets are exhibiting an “extraordinary amount of complacency” in the face of those and other risks. “When I’ve seen all these things adding up that are on the fringes of extreme, I don’t think we can predict the outcome, and I think the chance of inflation going up and stagflation is a little bit higher than other people think,” Dimon said during his company’s annual investor day on Monday. “There are too many things out there, and I think you’re going to see the effect.” “Even at these low levels, if they stay where they are today, [those are] pretty extreme tariffs. And you also don’t know how every country is going to respond,” he said. And trading partners are responding by cutting deals with other countries, he added. In addition, Dimon said the US cannot quickly resort to domestically produced goods for those imports, adding that it takes three to four years, at minimum, to build a manufacturing plant. On April 2, what Donald Trump called “Liberation Day,” the US president imposed on trade partners, only to partially walk them back a week later. The reprieve was supposed to last 90 days to allow countries to negotiate with the administration. Trump officials have said around 100 countries have offered to negotiate deals, setting a before US trade negotiators to race against the clock to make new commitments. Last week, the US and China agreed to drastically roll back tariffs on each other’s goods for an initial 90-day period, in a surprise breakthrough. However, tariffs of at least 30% on the vast majority of products from China are still challenging for as well as . Dimon said he believes that the odds of stagflation — an economic circumstance of high inflation coupled with stagnant growth or, worse, a recession — are likely twice that of what others have projected. In that event, he said, credit losses would rise, not to the extent they did during the financial crisis 17 years ago, but worse than expected. “I think there have been 15 years of pretty happy-go-lucky credit, a lot of new credit players, different covenants, different leverage ratios, the leverage on top of leverage, things like that,” he said. “So, I think I would expect that credit would be worse than people think of in every recession.” On May 16, Moody’s from its previously perfect AAA credit rating.

    "content": "A London-based technology company is looking to “democratize” talent-identification and scouting in soccer using a mobile app. Free to download and available globally, the aiScout app allows aspiring soccer stars to enter virtual trials for professional clubs by uploading self-recorded footage of themselves completing a series of drills. It offers 75 exercises, designed to test a range of skills, with videos showing users how to complete them. Performances are automatically scored by artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The data can then be accessed by clubs, allowing their scouts to peruse scores for viable talent, honing their search with a variety of filters; from age and gender to position on the pitch. The app currently has two English Premier League (EPL) partners, Chelsea and Burnley, and clubs can tailor their in-app trials to meet specific needs and set their own benchmarks by having their academy players complete the same drills. “We’re putting that data up front to make better use of [the scouts’] time,” said Richard Felton-Thomas, chief operating officer of ai.io, the company behind the app. “To say [to scouts], ‘Go over to this place today because there’s three players in that game that are all actually beating your Chelsea standard’ — that’s going to be the best use of your time.’” It already appears to be working for some. Ben Greenwood had never had a trial with a professional club until he downloaded the app in 2019. After uploading footage of himself, the 17-year-old landed a trial with Chelsea, becoming the first user of the app to get a trial with a pro club. He signed a contract with EPL team Bournemouth in 2021. Having beta-tested in with players spanning 125 countries, Greenwood among them, 135 players have been trialed or signed by pro clubs or national teams through the app — which fully launched in September 2023 — according to Felton-Thomas. Just over 100,000 players make up the current database, but with over 100 clubs lined up to join Chelsea and Burnley, as well as a multi-year partnership with Major League Soccer in the US announced last May, Felton-Thomas projects user numbers to surge into the millions as the operation ramps up this year. Felton-Thomas said the “lion’s share” of its income comes from charging clubs a license fee to run the platform. Annual fees vary depending on the size of the club and the tools they require, ranging from six figures for “tier one” sides like Chelsea, to thousands of pounds for clubs lower down the footballing pyramid. The use of smart technology in sport continues to expand, including and wearable tech for elite athletes. The global market for sports analytics, valued at in 2023, is projected to grow 22% by the end of the decade, according to market research firm Grand View Research. Should soccer talent scouts be concerned about being edged out by the arrival of AI in their industry? For Felton-Thomas, new technologies can co-exist with traditional methods. “It’s more about evolution than revolution,” Felton-Thomas explained. “We can’t tell you when that player’s actually in that match, how does he deal with adversity? What happens when he’s 2-0 down? What happens when someone’s shouting at him? What happens when he’s just made a massive mistake?” “We’ve got the ability to just augment real people to do their jobs better and faster, which then gives an opportunity to the player through the AI, but you’re still actually just connecting them to the human on the other side, which is the club and the scout.” While football remains ai.io’s primary focus, the company is looking into opportunities in other sports to launch in the coming years. Further ahead, it may branch out beyond sports. “You think about the notion that you can be at home and analyze your movements, and how this could spin into health care, physical assessments for military disciplines and emergency services,” Felton-Thomas told CNN.",

    "content": "Global electric vehicle sales are set to rise by more than a fifth to reach 17 million this year, powered by drivers in China, according to the International Energy Agency. In a report Tuesday, the IEA projected that “surging demand” for EVs over the next decade was set “to remake the global auto industry and significantly reduce oil consumption for road transport.” It expects half of all cars sold globally to be electric by 2035, up from more than one in five this year, provided charging infrastructure keeps pace. The IEA includes battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles in its definition of EVs. The agency’s bullish long-term outlook for EVs — based on current government policies — comes just days after the world’s biggest battery EV maker Tesla to counter declining sales and growing competition from Chinese upstarts and established carmakers. Recent negative headlines about slowing EV penetration are out of step with positive global trends, according to IEA executive director Fatih Birol. The data “does not at all show a reverse of the growth of electric cars. It shows an extremely robust increase of global electric car sales,” he told reporters Tuesday. The growth is not driven just by Chinese buyers. The number of new battery electric cars sold in the European Union almost 4% in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2023, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. In a statement, Birol said: “Rather than tapering off, the global EV revolution appears to be gearing up for a new phase of growth.” Despite the upbeat trends, EV makers are grappling with slim profit margins, squeezed by price wars as competition heats. In the past few days, Tesla and Chinese EV maker Li Auto have cut prices on major models in China, the world’s biggest EV market, with Tesla also cutting prices in Germany and the United States. Earlier this month, Tesla posted its in nearly four years. The company’s stock has plunged more than 40% so far this year. China’s BYD has also stumbled after it briefly surpassed Tesla as global market leader, with its sales falling to about 300,000 in the first quarter from more than 525,000 in the final three months of 2023. Automakers may be hurting from the price cuts but they will be crucial to increasing the take-up of EVs around the world, according to the IEA, which emphasized that the “pace of the transition to EVs… will hinge on affordability.” In China, more than 60% of EVs sold last year were less expensive than conventional cars, but in Europe and the United States the purchase price for new cars with internal combustion engines remains lower on average. “Intensifying market competition and improving battery technologies are expected to reduce (EV) prices in the coming years,” the IEA said. “Growing electric car exports from Chinese automakers, which accounted for more than half of all electric car sales in 2023, could add to downward pressure on purchase prices,” it added. Last year, Chinese carmakers accounted for more than half of global electric car sales, compared with their 10% share of the conventional car market. “China is the de facto leader of electric car manufacturing around the world,” Birol said. Concerns about soaring imports of Chinese EVs prompted the European Union to open an late last year into China’s state support for EV makers. The auto industry is a major employer in Europe and crucial to the region’s biggest economy, Germany, which is home to Volkswagen, Audi and BMW. EV sales in China will account for almost 60% of the global total this year and about 45% of all car sales in the country. By 2030, almost one in three cars on the roads in China is set to be electric, up from fewer than one in 10 last year, according to the IEA. That compares with its forecast for 17% in the United States and 18% in the European Union, compared with just over 2% and almost 4% respectively last year. “This shift will have major ramifications for both the auto industry and the energy sector,” Birol said. The IEA sees global oil demand peaking in 2030, helped by the electrification of the transport sector. In addition to affordability, another barrier to mass adoption of electric cars is a lack of public charging infrastructure in Europe and the United States. Under current government policies, the number of public EV charging points worldwide is expected to reach 15 million by the end of the decade, a near-fourfold increase from last year, according to the IEA.",

    "content": "Texting on the Moon? Streaming on Mars? It may not be as far away as you think. That’s the shared vision of NASA and Nokia, who have partnered to set up a cellular network on the Moon to help lay the building blocks for long-term human presence on other planets. A SpaceX rocket is due to launch this year — the exact date has yet to be confirmed — carrying a simple 4G network to the Moon. The lander will install the system at the Moon’s south pole and then it will be remotely controlled from Earth. “The first challenge to getting a network up and running is having a space-qualified cellular equipment that meets the appropriate size, weight, and power requirements, as well as being deployed without a technician,” Walt Engelund, deputy associate administrator for programs at NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, told CNN. No less of a challenge, it will need to operate in the harsh lunar environment of extreme temperatures and radiation. The 4G network unit is being built by Nokia’s Bell Labs using a range of off-the-shelf commercial components. It will be loaded onto a lander made by US company Intuitive Machines, and once deployed it will connect the lander via radio equipment to two roaming vehicles with their own special mission: to search for ice. One of the vehicles, the Lunar Outpost rover, will explore the area known as Shackleton Connecting Ridge, while the other, the Micro-Nova hopper, will plunge into a crater to scan for unprecedented up-close evidence of Moon Images of ice — transmitted back to the lander and then Earth in near real-time via the cellular network — would be a world-first. Lunar ice could be used to create breathable oxygen, and even fuel that could eventually be used to launch Mars missions from the Moon. For NASA’s program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon this decade, cellular connectivity is invaluable. Currently, astronauts talk to each other by radio, but NASA wants a lunar communications system capable of supporting high-resolution video and science data, said Engelund — especially as Artemis missions become more sophisticated. “Being able to communicate on the Moon is critical to Artemis — as critical as any other mission element like power, water to drink, and air to breathe,” said Engelund. “Eventually, this effort will help establish a lunar communications network that could give our explorers the ability to beam scientific data back, confer with mission control, and talk to their families, as if they were walking down the street on their cellphones.” It could lay the groundwork for an off-world internet not dissimilar to that of Earth’s. Personal devices could connect to such networks, allowing ﻿space colonists to use smartphones that can access all the and services available to those back on Earth. NASA selected Bell Labs as part of its Tipping Point initiative, a series of partnerships with companies to develop technologies for future missions that puts them in prime position for key roles in the future space economy. Bell Labs was given a in 2020, and in January, Nokia was by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to begin working on a communications services infrastructure that will eventually serve as the “framework for the lunar economy.” “A future lunar economy will critically depend on communication technologies to collect and analyze data, share information, and maintain and control operations,” Thierry Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research, told CNN. “This includes sustaining a semi-permanent or permanent human presence on the Moon, as well as automated robotic operations for transportation, resource mining, mineral processing and scientific data collection.” There are potential commercial benefits for Earthly business ventures too. If a network can withstand the journey into orbit, then deploy and endure autonomously amid the vacuum of space, wildly fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation, it will be able to survive the harshest locations on Earth — such as polar ice caps, deserts, or offshore platforms. “Especially when it comes to remote deployments, industrial sites, public safety, emergency response, disaster recovery or defense, it is highly beneficial to have compact, low-footprint network equipment that can be easily transported and deployed anywhere,” Klein said.",

    "content": "This is an epic — pardon the pun — week for Comcast and the wider media business. Epic Universe, the first major new theme park in the US in 20-plus years, is opening in Orlando, Florida, on Thursday. Fans are expected to camp out overnight ahead of the official opening day. Comcast’s NBCUniversal says Epic is the “most technologically advanced theme park” ever. It cost an estimated $7.7 billion and took more than six years to build. Accordingly, Comcast is putting all its corporate muscle into the launch. Epic Universe “showcases the incredible creativity, innovation, and operational excellence of our talented teams,” Mark Woodbury, the chair of Universal Destinations & Experiences, told CNN. This moment is about more than a single company’s awesome new roller coasters. It’s about media giants meeting the growing demand for live experiences, or what some analysts call “the experience economy.” “People want to immerse themselves in the characters and franchises and content they love,” said media analyst Rich Greenfield of Lightshed Partners. Disney, the reigning theme park king, recently announced a deal to . It is also doubling its fleet of cruise ships around the world. Universal has more to come, as well. It is developing a theme park in the United Kingdom, slated to open in 2031. It also has smaller-scale projects in the works, like a horror experience in Las Vegas and a kids’ resort in Frisco, Texas. Some of the same companies that have competed in the so-called “streaming wars” are also locked in “theme park wars,” Greenfield observed. Universal’s two theme parks in Orlando have often been seen as the “add-on” for tourists who spend more time at Disney’s four parks there. Disney has, of course, been paying close attention to its rival. In the past year, Disney has announced some major expansions to its Florida parks, giving fans new reasons to return in the years ahead. Epic Universe may start to change those calculations. Woodbury predicted that Epic “will transform Universal Orlando Resort into a full week vacation destination that delivers mind-blowing experiences for global audiences.” Historically, Disney CFO Hugh Johnston told investors last year, “Other non-Disney parks opening in Florida (have) been positive for Disney bookings.” When Greenfield was at Epic for a sneak preview of the park this spring, he was struck by how much space for further expansion Universal still has. He suggested this week’s launch is “step one to making Universal more of the destination versus the add-on.” All four hours of NBC’s “Today” show were live from Epic Universe on Wednesday morning to show off the park to viewers, and all of Comcast’s top executives traveled to Orlando for Wednesday night’s opening ceremony. Universal’s parks promote NBC’s intellectual property, of course — Epic has a “How to Train Your Dragon” world — but feature partner media brands, too, like The Wizarding World of Harry Potter from Warner Bros. Discovery (CNN’s parent) and Super Nintendo World from Nintendo. In recent interviews, Universal executives have highlighted the new park’s trackless ride systems, augmented reality features, and high-resolution projections. They say Harry Potter and the Battle at the Ministry is the company’s most impressive attraction to date. Both Universal and Disney have leaned heavily on parks to generate profits during a turbulent period elsewhere across the media industry. As Comcast president Mike Cavanagh told analysts last month, the theme park business is unique because it “is, within media, not at all exposed to the shift in time on screens from one venue to another.” After all, parks are the opposite of “screen time” — they’re where the characters from screens appear to come to life.",

    "content": "The Trump White House, which touts itself as “the most transparent” administration in history, has removed a database of official transcripts documenting President Donald Trump’s announcements and appearances. The “ ” section of the White House website now features YouTube videos rather than the transcripts that past administrations have published for decades. The change is yet another example of the Trump administration trying to exert more control. Rather than printing every transcript, thus creating a comprehensive record for the public, the White House is selectively publicizing some events and skipping others. The selection of “remarks” videos is noticeably incomplete, as it includes fewer than 50 Trump videos from the first 120 days of his second term. The White House publishes a much greater number of videos on YouTube, including highly partisan attacks and propagandistic mashups. HuffPost senior White House correspondent S.V. Date, who observed that the administration was cutting back on Trump transcripts earlier this spring, wrote last week that the White House was “excluding many of his most unhinged comments” from its website. In response, White House communications director Steven Cheung told Date to “stop beclowning yourself.” Now the transcripts have been removed altogether, with one exception: Trump’s . Stenographers employed by the government still record and transcribe all of Trump’s remarks, including his interactions with the media. Those records just aren’t being posted. The YouTube videos are not a complete replacement because some of Trump’s remarks are not archived in video form, either. Other records typically published by previous administrations, like White House press briefing transcripts, have also been omitted in recent months. The currently only includes the transcript of press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s very first briefing in January. The transcript purge impacts journalists and researchers more than the average taxpayer. However, searchable, text-based records of a president’s words are inherently valuable for holding an administration to account. Joe Biden’s White House understood that when it of his “garbage” remarks about Trump supporters, despite official stenographer concerns. And so the disappearing Trump transcripts are revealing in terms of the administration’s priorities — and what Leavitt means when she touts “transparency.” Perhaps “visibility” is the more accurate word. The Trump White House is certainly visible, often prioritizing videos and photos over the written word. While Trump’s bombastic and improvisational speaking style demands heavy scrutiny and fact-checking, he often seems to care far more about images — specifically those of strength and dominance. In response to a CNN request for comment about the website change, Leavitt said, “The president’s remarks are live on the website for every person in the world, including journalists, to access and watch for themselves. The Trump White House is the most transparent in history.” The White House does, indeed, live stream Trump’s remarks. But the transcript purge is still quite telling. And it makes the existence of outside databases, like Roll Call’s , all the more valuable. “The move certainly underscores the reason to have a free and independent record of the president’s statements and responses,” Factba.se founder and developer Bill Frischling told CNN. It also highlights Trump’s disregard for White House staff stenographers, a dynamic that former stenographer Beck Dorey-Stein described in for The New York Times. “Mr. Trump likes to call anyone who disagrees with him ‘fake news,’” Dorey-Stein wrote. “But if he’s really the victim of so much inaccurate reporting, why is he so averse to having the facts recorded and transcribed?”",

    "content": "The Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday sent Media Matters for America a letter demanding communications between the progressive media watchdog and advertising entities as the commission probes whether the watchdog colluded with advertisers to pull funding from Elon Musk’s X. Media Matters was notified in a letter dated May 20 from the FTC that it is being investigated, a source familiar with the letter told CNN. The letter, which CNN has viewed, directs Media Matters to turn over all documents, materials and communications with a range of ad entities and related organizations — including the World Federation of Advertisers and the Global Alliance for Responsible Media — regarding brand safety and disinformation, the source said. Media Matters is a media watchdog whose reporting tracks conservative and far-right news publications and personalities. The organization was after it published a report detailing antisemitic and pro-Nazi content on the social media platform he owns, X. That lawsuit accuses the media watchdog of hatching a “media strategy to drive advertisers from the platform and destroy X Corp.” In keeping its request for assorted materials vague, the FTC is effectively throwing the kitchen sink at the wall to see what sticks, the source told CNN. The move by the FTC sees the commission’s chair, Andrew Ferguson, make good on , for the job. “We must prosecute any unlawful collusion between online platforms, and confront advertiser boycotts which threaten competition among those platforms,” then-Commissioner Ferguson said about a different case. That’s exactly what Musk, who has spearheaded the president’s Department of Government Efficiency, has spent years accusing the progressive watchdog of doing, claiming Media Matters by publishing the report. In a Thursday statement, Angelo Carusone, the Media Matters president, said that the Trump administration has been “defined by naming right-wing media figures to key posts and abusing the power of the federal government to bully political opponents and silence critics.” “It’s clear that’s exactly what’s happening here, given Media Matters’ history of holding those same figures to account,” Carusone said. “These threats won’t work; we remain steadfast to our mission.” In 2024, , as the platform is now known, citing concerns that the extreme content that has proliferated there since Musk’s takeover could damage their brands. Musk himself has buoyed conspiracy theories and hate speech with his own account. He also told advertisers that left the platform to “ .” But advertisers began fleeing the social media platform nearly a year after , expressing concerns about the billionaire’s gutting of the platform’s content moderation team, mass layoffs, and uncertainty over the platform’s future. In July 2023, months before Musk sued Media Matters, the billionaire reported . Since the exodus, Musk has sought to mend fences, looking to woo back advertisers via a . But that same year, , a voluntary ad-industry initiative run by the World Federation of Advertisers, claiming that the group illegally coordinated an ad boycott against X. In February, to include Lego, Nestlé, Shell and several others. Advertisers named in the lawsuit filed a motion last week to dismiss his suit, claiming that Musk was using it “to win back the business X lost in the free market when it disrupted its own business and alienated many of its customers.” Additionally, in March, , claiming that he lodged several expensive lawsuits against the watchdog “for having dared to publish an article Musk did not like.” Media Matters has seen similar probes before. In 2023, , accusing the Texas attorney general of violating the First Amendment by investigating Media Matters’ reporting on Musk’s app, similarly arguing that it was being penalized for its reporting. The progressive watchdog against the Texas attorney general in 2024. The FTC declined to comment for this story. WFA did not respond to a request for comment on the probe.",

The deal makes US-based RedBird the sole controlling owner of The Telegraph, the right-leaning﻿ British news outlet founded in 1855. Per the deal, RedBird will invest funds in The Telegraph’s digital operations to help continue growing subscriptions and expand the outlet’s foothold in the United States, where RedBird already has a constellation of media investments. The deal comes after RedBird struggled for two years to acquire The Telegraph, stymied in large part by a conservative British government that and capped foreign state-owned investment by a publisher at 15%. The UK’s Labour Party, which swept into power in July 2024, announced last week that it would relax restrictions on foreign investment. “This transaction marks the start of a new era for The Telegraph as we look to grow the brand in the UK and internationally, invest in its technology and expand its subscriber base,” RedBird CEO Gerry Cardinale said in a statement. In January 2024, Jeff Zucker, the former CNN president, flew to London to of the media company to Ofcom on behalf of RedBird IMI, where he is the chief executive. The Telegraph went up for sale in 2023 after Lloyds Banking Group from the Barclay family, which . The Barclay family in December 2023 with the help of a loan from RedBird IMI, an Abu Dhabi-backed joint venture. However, the British government blocked the transfer of ownership to RedBird. The Friday deal avoided that rule by providing IMI only a minority share in the paper. RedBird’s focus on the US market comes as other British media outlets, including the BBC, The Guardian, and The Independent, have expanded their US coverage, often to great success.

    "content": "Artificial intelligence startup Anthropic says its new AI model can work for nearly seven hours in a row, in another sign that AI could soon handle full shifts of work now done by humans. The new model could bring AI one step closer to replacing jobs as tech giants race to build ever more powerful artificial intelligence. It could represent a shift in how people use AI at work, moving from asking digital agents to accomplish individual tasks to giving these tools a broader objective – similar to the way one might instruct an employee or coworker. Anthropic, which counts Amazon and Google among its backers, introduced its new Opus 4 model on Thursday, along with another model for general use named Claude Sonnet 4. The new model can handle larger, more complex projects, for about a full workday operating independently, without additional prompts from a human. While that’s not exactly a one-to-one match for the kind of workday a human might have, switching among projects or tasks, it’s still a significant advance. Anthropic says the assistant could be a tool for automating mundane aspects of the workday rather than eliminating roles. “It’s like the kind of thing that is challenging that, you know, might represent 30% of your day, that isn’t necessarily fulfilling or professionally expanding you, but is necessary in the pursuit of being successful in your job,” said Scott White, Anthropic’s product lead for the company’s AI assistant Claude.ai. White provided an example of a marketer who wants to analyze previous performance to develop a new advertising strategy. Claude Opus 4 would be able to analyze the current strategy, look through the company’s Facebook and Google ads to assess their performance, notice the difference between the two campaigns and then offer suggestions as to why they may have performed differently. “It’s basically the ability for Claude to think and reason deeply over a long period of time about your goal, while also using a set of tools with its reasoning capabilities to look at problems from new angles and continue moving the task forward,” he said. Anthropic’s model arrives as more companies are investing in AI. A survey from venture capital firm – also an Anthropic investor – found that enterprise spending on generative AI, the type of AI that can create content and powers services like ChatGPT and Claude, grew sixfold in 2024 compared to 2023. That report also indicated Anthropic doubled its reach, eating into OpenAI’s dominant position in the market for AI’s business services. reported that 92% of companies plan to increase investments in generative AI over the next three years. And Anthropic is far from the only one looking to cash in. Google on Tuesday announced that its autonomous coding tool, , will be available to the public, while Microsoft a more advanced coding assistant for its Github development platform on Monday. Apple is reportedly working with Anthropic on a new tool that can write and test code, according to . At the same time, experts increasingly say AI could lead to job losses. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs report, released earlier this year, 41% of employers plan to downsize as generative AI plays a bigger role in work-related tasks. Aneesh Raman, the chief economic opportunity officer at LinkedIn, recently fretted about AI replacing some entry level jobs in a op-ed. Anthropic’s White thinks AI will make it easier for people to grow their careers outside their formal educations, such as an engineer using AI to design a visual mockup without any design training. However, he acknowledged the need to address the issue of AI’s impact on the workforce. “It’s not also something that only Anthropic can take a perspective on,” he said. “This is something that the government, policy makers, many companies, need to work together to understand the arc of how this is going to be implemented.”",

    "content": "Minutes after Louisiana State Police got word on Friday morning that a New Orleans jail, two of them were spotted on facial recognition cameras in the city’s French Quarter. Police arrested one of the escapees shortly after; the other, days later. The cameras were part of a network of around 5,000 operated around the city by the non-profit Project NOLA, 200 of which are outfitted with facial recognition technology. State police had shared information about the jailbreak with the organization. The incident marks a win for the organization, whose camera network is believed to be unprecedented in the United States. The group is emblematic of a growing — albeit controversial — push to use facial recognition technology to help solve crimes. “This is the exact reason why facial recognition technology is so critical,” New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said during a press conference earlier this week. But as adoption of the technology has grown, advocacy groups warn that it could undermine individual privacy. Even worse, inaccurate matches by facial recognition technology systems run by police departments elsewhere have led to false arrests in other cities. In New Orleans, those concerns may be heightened by the fact that Project NOLA is independent from local law enforcement agencies — although it shares information with police — and therefore isn’t necessarily subject to the same scrutiny or accountability. “This is the stuff of authoritarian surveillance states, and has no place in American policing,” Nathan Freed Wessler, deputy director of ACLU’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project, said in a following a Washington Post about the effort earlier this week. But Project NOLA is a community endeavor, said Executive Director Bryan Lagarde, supported by the churches, schools, businesses and individual homeowners who he says allow the group to place cameras on their properties and can remove them at any time. “This has been a community endeavor from the very beginning,” Lagarde told CNN. “If we ever violate public trust, (the camera network) comes down instantly and effortlessly by the community that built it.” Project NOLA was created in 2009 to be a “force multiplier” for local law enforcement agencies, whose resources had been impacted by Hurricane Katrina, Lagarde said. Today, the non-profit also operates 5,000 cameras in other cities around the country. Project NOLA takes images of wanted suspects from law enforcement “be on the lookout” alerts and feeds them into its “hot list” system. When its network of facial recognition cameras identifies a potential match, it sends a real-time alert to law enforcement. That’s what happened on Friday, when two of the escaped inmates walked in front of Project NOLA cameras mounted on local businesses in New Orleans’ French Quarter. One was arrested shortly after. The other was tracked to a housing complex where Project NOLA does not have cameras but was arrested on Tuesday thanks in part to the information provided by Project NOLA about his likely location, Five escapees from the Friday jailbreak remain at large. Project NOLA cameras were also the New Orleans terror attack last New Year’s Day that killed 14 people. Lagarde declined to provide the name of the third-party company that makes the facial recognition artificial intelligence model the group uses in its cameras. As with many applications of AI, there is no federal regulation regarding whether and how AI can be used by local law enforcement. But a number of other cities have by government agencies, including police, over concerns about its efficacy and ethical implications. has shown that the technology is less effective at correctly identifying women and people of color than white men, fueling worries that the tech’s shortcomings could have an outsize impact Given the history of racial bias within some US police forces, “Black and other people of color are at greater risk of misidentification,” when facial recognition is brought into the fold, Nicol Turner Lee and Caitlin Chin Rothman wrote in a 2022 Brookings . CNN has reached out to NOPD for comment regarding its relationship with Project NOLA. Kirkpatrick, the police superintendent, told the earlier this week that her agency had launched a review of officers’ use of alerts provided by Project NOLA, the accuracy of the information the group provides and how the partnership fits within city rules. Lagarde said Project NOLA has aimed to be transparent with the New Orleans community about its work, including by partnering with locals to put up its cameras and about its work on social media. “All of our data is on-network, which means it comes from our own network of cameras. Our cameras are on people’s homes, business, churches, schools… The facial recognition is not being paid for by tax dollars. It is not accessible directly by law enforcement,” he said. “So, you know, we are the gatekeepers. We check everything that goes into the system make sure it’s valid.”",

    "content": "US President Donald Trump boasted “jobs and factories will come roaring back” ﻿when he unleashed unprecedented tariffs around the world during his “Liberation Day” address last month. But there’s one product the president is particularly eager . “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Friday morning on Truth Social. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.” But Dan Ives, global head of technology research at financial services firm Wedbush Securities, told in April that idea is a “fictional tale.” US-made iPhones will likely cost more than three times their current price of around $1,000, Ives said, because of the costs associated with replicating the highly complex production ecosystem that currently exists in Asia. “You build that (supply chain) in the US with a fab in West Virginia and New Jersey. They’ll be $3,500 iPhones,” he said, referring to fabrication plants, or high-tech manufacturing facilities where computer chips that power electronic devices are normally made. And even then, it would cost Apple about $30 billion and three years to move just 10% of their supply chain to the US to begin with, Ives told Burnett. CNN has reached out to Apple for comment regarding Trump’s Friday remarks. The making and assembly of smartphone parts shifted to Asia decades ago, as American companies largely focused on software development and product design, which generate much higher profit margins. That move has helped make Apple one of the world’s most valuable companies and cement itself as a dominant smartphone maker. Since Trump’s inauguration in late January, Apple’s shares have lost more than 14% of their value due to concerns about the impact of tariffs on its sprawling supply chain, which is highly dependent on China and Taiwan. About 90% of Apple’s iPhone production takes place in China, according to Ives. “That’s why I think you see what’s happened to the stock, because no company is more caught up in this tariff front and center in this category five storm than Cupertino and Apple,” he said in April. “It’s an economic Armageddon, but especially for the tech industry.” The chips that power iPhones are mainly manufactured in Taiwan, while its screen panels are supplied by South Korean companies. Some other components are made in China, and final assembly mostly takes place in the country. The administration’s exemption of smartphones and other electronics containing semiconductors from the elevated “reciprocal” tariffs on China has spared iPhones from the harshest levies, but Apple still faces a 20% tariff on Chinese goods for the country’s role in the fentanyl trade. Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the company’s most recent that “the majority” of iPhones coming into the United States will now be shipped from India, adding that tariffs could add $900 million to Apple’s costs this quarter. In February, Apple announced it would invest in the United States over the next four years as part of its effort expand production outside China and to avoid Trump’s tariffs on the country. Apple has been seeking to diversify its production bases from China to India and Brazil. But Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, estimates it would be difficult for Apple not to raise iPhone prices if it faces tariffs of 30% or higher. “Anything below 30, they will probably carry the vast majority of that increase,” he said. “But I think at some point they’re going to have to start to share it.”",

    "content": "Following reports from CNN and other news outlets, Senator Maggie Hassan is demanding information about how Spotify is handling phony podcasts promoting potentially illegal online pharmacies. Spotify said last week that it had removed dozens of podcasts that blatantly promoted the online pharmacies purportedly selling drugs such as Adderall and Oxycontin, in some cases without a prescription. Business Insider also that it had flagged 200 podcasts that Spotify subsequently removed. The fake podcasts — which had showed up among the top suggestions in searches for drug names — violated Spotify’s rules and threatened to direct users to spammy and potentially illegal websites. US law prohibits buying controlled substances online without a prescription. , experts and lawmakers have urged to do more to prevent the sale of counterfeit or illicit drugs to young people through their platforms, after multiple of overdoses from . Now Hassan, a New Hampshire Democrat and the ranking member of the Joint Economic Committee, wants answers about how these fake podcasts proliferated on Spotify and what the company is doing to stop it from happening again In a letter sent Thursday, Hassan urged Spotify CEO Daniel Ek to “take action to prevent fake podcasts that facilitate the illicit sale of drugs.” “Far too many parents have experienced the unimaginable pain of losing their child to an accidental overdose,” Hassan told CNN in an exclusive statement ahead of the letter’s release. “Spotify has a responsibility to significantly ramp up its efforts to stop criminals from using the platform to facilitate deadly drug sales to anyone, especially teens.” The letter asks Spotify to provide details about the content it has taken down; how many users interacted with the drug sales podcasts before they were removed; whether the company earned any revenue from the podcasts; and whether Spotify works with law enforcement when it discovers illegal content. It also asks what moderation tools and practices the company has implemented to identify drug-related content and whether it will be making any updates considering the recent reports. Hassan has asked Spotify to respond by June 12. In a statement to CNN last week, a Spotify spokesperson said: “We are constantly working to detect and remove violating content across our service.” In response to Hassan’s letter, the company reiterated that statement, and a spokesperson added that such content also exists on other platforms and that the company has earned no revenue from the phony podcasts.",

    "content": "Financial files in disarray. Late payments and last-warning service-cutoff notices. Multiple daily bank withdrawals. Out-of-character purchases. When a family member who has been fairly responsible with money all their lives becomes careless with their finances, it may be one sign of as-yet-undiagnosed . Researchers at the who analyzed both US credit reporting and Medicare data found that in the five years before a dementia diagnosis, a person’s average credit scores may start to weaken and their payment delinquencies rise. “The harmful financial effects of undiagnosed memory disorders exacerbate the already substantial financial pressure households face upon diagnosis,” the researchers wrote. “Beyond susceptibility to payment delinquency, early stage [Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders] may affect new account openings and debt accumulation, credit utilization, and/or credit mix.” Their findings echo the results of a 2020 study from the . Marcey Tidwell, who lives in Bloomington, Indiana, said those findings are “not remotely shocking.” Tidwell’s mother was diagnosed with a form of dementia in 2020 and has been living with her daughter ever since. Tidwell said that for most of her life, her mother was an “outrageously methodical human being” who kept the bills paid and the family records organized across many moves as her husband pursued a career in the military. After going through her mother’s papers this year, Tidwell surmises that her mother’s memory started faltering around 2015, because from that point forward her record-keeping became “less than pristine.” For example, Tidwell said, her mom used to keep an immaculate record of checks written and deposits and withdrawals made in her checkbook register. But that register became a mess. “There was a bunch of stuff scratched out and she was obsessively adding and re-adding — she knew things weren’t all they could be. Later on, I saw that she took out large amounts of her savings, more than she needed for groceries.” Karen Lemay, who lives in Ottawa, Canada, knew something was really wrong with her father in 2022 when she saw on his desk piles of late-payment notices and final-notification warnings from service providers and insurers. Her father was a former finance executive who “was very conservative with his money, very smart about it and never reckless with it,” she said. And he had strongly impressed upon his daughter the importance of paying off her credit card in full every month to avoid interest. Yet Lemay discovered he owed $50,000 in charges, interest and late payment fees on a Visa card. He also financed the purchase of a new car he didn’t need, just months before police took away his driver’s license. Normally, he would only buy high-end used cars with cash, she said. What’s more, his daughter noted, he failed to pay his 2021 taxes. So he ended up owing the government roughly $20,000, the bulk of which was for late payment and underpayment penalties. “I spoke to him about some of his balances and he refused to believe he hadn’t paid them,” Lemay said. Jayne Sibley, who lives in the United Kingdom, knows the pain and stress of dealing with the financial behaviors that can signal dementia. Her father and mother were both diagnosed with different forms of it. Her father moved into a nursing home years ago, but her now-deceased mother remained in her own home, albeit with live-in care. “The most challenging thing we faced was managing mum’s everyday money as her condition progressed. She would overspend on things she didn’t need or want. Random items, cleaning equipment, luxury food. She also fell victim to scams over the phone — a fake insurance policy, those sorts of things,” Sibley said. Her mother also would take money out of the cash machine two to three times a day and give it to anyone who asked. Acutely aware of how high long-term care costs were, given her father’s situation, Sibley said she worried that her mother would run through the money that would be needed for her own care. While her mother’s condition made her vulnerable with money, she initially was still able to walk and shop and go to yoga on her own. In other words, she was able to maintain a lot of her autonomy and social ties. To try to stem the money outflow, Sibley and her brother tried doling out a week’s worth of cash for their mother “but she’d spend it all in one go,” she said. Ditto when they tried divvying the cash up into daily envelopes. Eventually, they took away her cash card. But, soon after, her condition worsened, Sibley said. “She wasn’t able to maintain her familiar routines and social connections. That’s when we realized there has to be a better way.” With her husband, she founded , which offers a debit card in the UK that can be used by a person with dementia to maintain some sense of financial autonomy and social engagement. When needed, family caregivers can monitor their debit transactions via an app. As a person’s condition worsens, the caregiver can set limits on how much money can be spent on any given day or week, and where the card can be used (eg, at cash machines, online or at the grocery store). While there are few dementia-specific financial tools to reduce the odds that someone squanders their own hard-earned money, there are steps you can take to make it easier to assume control over another person’s finances when they become incapacitated. In 2008, a year after her father died without a will and a dozen years before her mother was diagnosed with dementia, Tidwell said she and her siblings took their mother to a lawyer to make sure she had a will, named her medical proxy and named the person to whom she would give power of attorney to handle her financial affairs should the need arise. That made it easier for Tidwell, among other things, to get online access in 2018 to her mother’s bank account to make sure nothing was amiss. By 2020, she had automated her mother’s bill paying online. “The time to make plans is you need to. It’s hard to overstate what a gift that trip to the lawyer in 2008 was to ‘future me,’” said Tidwell, who fully manages her mother’s finances now that her condition has worsened considerably. Since dementia can worsen over time and because someone in the initial stages may not recognize they are more vulnerable to financial errors and scams, the US recommends that a family take steps early on to alleviate those concerns, such as setting up automated bill payments for the person with dementia. Of course, no amount of can alleviate the heartbreak of watching a loved one with dementia decline. “I prepared as best as I could, but it’s still hard,” Tidwell said. That’s why she advises anyone potentially facing a similar situation to, in her words, “make the easy part easy.”",

    "title": "\n      Smart moves to make when the Fed starts cutting rates\n    ",
    "author": "Jeanne Sahadi",
    "publication_date": "2024-07-27T16:00:03.433Z",
    "cate": "business",
    "content": "Over the past couple of years, the Federal Reserve aggressively raised its key interest rate to a 23-year high to beat down inflation. Now that inflation has and is expected to cool further, the central bank is expected to embark on a rate-cutting campaign over the next two years, starting as early as September. If it does, rates should decline on a wide swath of financial products for Americans, from credit cards and home loans to bank accounts and certificates of deposit, among others. Given how many ways lower rates can affect your finances, here are some things to consider when deciding what steps to take in response. The prospect of lower borrowing costs will be welcome news to those seeking loans or anyone trying to reduce their existing debt loads. But, realistically, how much you’ll save when the Fed lowers rates will depend on how quickly it cuts and by how much each time. The answer for the near term is most likely to be “not that much.” “Interest rates took the elevator going up, but they will take the stairs coming down,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. By that he means: “Rates are not going to fall fast enough to bail you out of a bad situation [this year],” McBride said. “And for savers, [the initial declines] won’t wipe out your interest earnings. Savers will still be way ahead of the game.” That’s because one or even two quarter-point rate cuts this year won’t meaningfully reduce many of your interest costs. But several cuts over the next year or two could make a noticeable difference, and it may be worth holding your fire on some moves until then. “Don’t jump the gun too early on this stuff,” said Chris Diodato, a fee-only certified financial planner and founder of WELLth Financial Planning. Here’s a breakdown of how lower rates may affect key areas of your financial life, along with tips from Diodato and McBride on what to do about it. Getting a mortgage is one of the biggest financial moves most people ever make. Mortgage rates are influenced by a number of economic factors, and the Fed’s moves are one. Since loan amounts are substantial, this is one area where even small cuts in interest rates could make a meaningful difference in what a homebuyer will pay. For those buying a home this year, you may be tempted to buy down points to reduce your mortgage rate. Before doing so, Diodato advised, crunch some numbers to make sure it will actually save you money if you think you may be tempted to refinance in a year or two should rates drop further. That’s because you will pay thousands of dollars to buy down your mortgage rate now, and then thousands more in fees to refinance. To buy down a quarter of a point might cost you 1% of your loan or 4% for a full point, he said. To refi, the costs could be higher — they typically run between 2% and 6% of your loan, according to Lending Tree. Given that mortgage rates have fallen at least 1.25% in every rate-cutting cycle since 1971, and often over 2% or 3%, Diodato sees it this way: “Buying your rate down a quarter of a percentage point, or even a full percentage point, wouldn’t stop most people from wanting to refinance at some point during the next rate-cut cycle. So, my rationale is not to saddle folks with both paying for points and then the costs of a refinance.” As for taking out a home equity line of credit, be aware that it’s no longer cheap money to borrow: The current average rate range for HELOCs is roughly 9% to 11%. A couple of quarter-point rate cuts from the Fed won’t make it meaningfully cheaper, McBride said. “Americans are sitting on more equity than ever, but you have to be judicious about how you tap into it, given how much it costs to borrow against it. Just because you have equity doesn’t make it free money.” Of course, if you’re just taking out a HELOC to serve as an emergency lifeline and you never tap it, the rate may be less of a concern. But it still may cost you money by way of closing costs, any requirement that you withdraw a minimum amount at closing, or any other ancillary fees for having the line, such as an annual fee or inactivity fee, McBride noted. And if you already owe money on a HELOC, he suggested, “aggressively pay it down. It’s high-cost debt that won’t get cheaper soon.” Another perpetually high-cost form of debt is your unpaid credit card balance . A few rate cuts won’t make much of a dent in today’s record-high average rate of 20.7%. Even if rate cuts ultimately push down the average to where it was at the start of 2022 — 16.3% — it will still be a pricey loan. That’s why, if you’re carrying credit card debt, the advice is the same as it has always been: If you qualify, sign up for a zero-rate balance transfer card that can buy you at least 12 to 18 months interest free so you can meaningfully pay down the principal you owe. If that proves difficult to get, see if you can transfer your balance to a credit card from a credit union or local bank that offers lower rates than the biggest banks. “They typically have fewer perks, but their rates can be half as high,” Dodiato said. If you want to finance the purchase of a new car, a rate-cutting environment may not help as much as you think. McBride notes that every quarter point cut knocks $4 a month off a typical loan for a $35,000 car. So a full percentage point drop amounts to just $16 a month, or less than $200 a year. “Your real lever for savings is the price of the car you choose, how much you’re financing and your credit rating,” he said. As for leasing a car, McBride noted, the effect of a Fed rate cut may be equally small on the so-called “money factor” you will pay to lease, and because many variables determine what that factor will be, it will be hard to figure out the impact of lower interest rates. The past year has been very good for anyone who parked cash in online high-yield savings accounts, many of which have been paying north of 5%. The same goes for those who could lock up their cash for certain periods of time in certificates of deposits or Treasuries, many durations of which were also paying north of 5%. While those rates will start to come down when the Fed starts cutting rates, the drops aren’t likely to be huge at first — meaning you will still be able to earn more on your savings than the rate of inflation for a while, McBride predicts. But it may no longer make sense to leave quite as much cash in these types of vehicles going forward. “I caution people against the cash trap. A lot of people, used to these nice savings rates, were diverting money from stocks and longer-term bonds,” said Diodato, who predicts yields on savings will eventually fall to 3% in the next two years. His advice: Don’t keep more than six months’ to a year’s worth of living expenses in cash or cash equivalents. “Anything more than that and you’re putting a drag on your future net worth,” he said. That said, McBride suggested that if you’re within five years of retirement, you might want to lock in some high rates still on offer today to grow the cash you’ll want to cover living expenses in the first few years after you stop working. Having that cash on hand means you won’t be forced to pull from your longer-term portfolio should there be a big . For instance, many CDs with durations of two, three, four or five years are currently paying between 4.85% and 5% on Schwab.com. If you do opt for such a longer-term CD, try to find one that is not “callable.” A callable CD is one that the issuer can decide to close out before its maturity date, which might happen if rates fall considerably during the next few years. “The call feature is a ‘Heads I win, tails you lose’ for the issuing bank,” McBride said.",

    "content": "Megan Rathmell thought she’d bombed her job interview earlier this year, assuming her nervousness and lack of preparation had cost her the opportunity. The 20-year-old later found out she got the job as a paralegal — and what made her stand out was her ability to do two important things: maintain eye contact and carry on a conversation. “My boss told me that I was a good communicator and that I was able to make strong eye contact, and that he hasn’t seen this from a lot of my peers,” said Rathmell, who is based in Virginia. “That was really surprising to me.” What Rathmell learned from her boss mirrors what hiring managers say: Some Gen Z college graduates are unprepared for job interviews or behave unprofessionally during job interviews. They bring parents to in-person interviews, refuse to turn the camera on during virtual interviews, use inappropriate language, dress unprofessionally and struggle to make eye contact. While there have always been people who interviewed badly for jobs, “it does seem to be more prevalent today,” said Dr. Nathan Mondragon, chief innovation officer at the hiring platform HireVue. There could be several factors contributing to the problem. The digital age has made many people less experienced with in-person interactions and therefore less comfortable with them especially challenging ones. Pandemic safety precautions only made that worse, Mondragon said. And while some parents are overinvolved in their child’s professional pursuits, others aren’t teaching them how to navigate the professional world without parental handholding. Some people think they can just wing a job interview, said Stacie Haller, chief career advisor at ResumeBuilder. But just like anything else you want to be successful at, getting a job also requires preparation. There will be plenty of competition for those jobs, as released by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday shows. The number of employed people increased by 254,000 in September, and the unemployment rate dropped to 4.1% from 4.2%, according to BLS data on nonfarm payroll employment. (That excludes people working as farmers, nonprofit or private household employees, and more.) There are about 6.8 million people who currently want a job — so here’s what you should do before, during and after an interview to stand out and get the job you want. Before you get an interview, you need to stand out from hundreds of other applicants, and you have about six seconds to catch a recruiter’s eye , Haller said. Therefore, your resume should be one compelling, clear and uncrowded page that is tailored to the position and highlights why you’re the best candidate. Be careful who you get advice from, Haller said. If you know other people who work at the company or in similar industries, consulting them could be good. Parents and other people their age, however, likely have good intentions but may have not interviewed for a job in decades or ever worked in your industry, and the workforce is different now. Unless you’ve gone to a specialty school, your college or graduate school career center may not have employees with any experience in hiring people, so it’s not always helpful, Haller said. Look the career center employees up online to see if they have a relevant track record. One of the biggest mistakes some interviewees make is asking questions about things they could have easily found by looking at just the homepage of a company’s website, said Dr. Nicolas Roulin, professor of industrial/organizational psychology at Saint Mary’s University in Canada. That, as well as not asking any questions at all, tells the interviewer you haven’t done your homework and probably don’t care about the job. Thoroughly research the company, experts said. You must be able to answer the question, “Why do you want to work here?” and express how you can contribute to the company’s values, culture, strategies, goals and more. By researching the interviewers, as well — if you have their names — you can ask them more in-depth questions about their job, goals and lives, and you may even find you have a fun personal connection to bring up, such as having attended the same school. Websites such as LinkedIn or Glassdoor can help you find some of this information. Glassdoor reviews are typically left by current or former employees. During the interview, you’ll also need to demonstrate how well you fit, and can perform, the job description. You can prepare by writing down your success stories for each requirement within that description, using . That acronym stands for situation, task, action and result — define the situation, what task needed to be accomplished, what actions you took alone or as part of a team to do so, and what the results were. Your questions are just as important as your answers, and they should show interest, motivation and care, as well as what’s important to you, experts said. Here are some examples, which you can practice on your own or in mock interviews with friends or family: If you struggle with nervousness before interviews, relaxation or , Roulin said. Experiencing more severe anxiety . Dressing professionally for both in-person and virtual interviews is important regardless of whether it’s for a fast-food restaurant, retail store or office job, experts said. — no jeans, shorts, flip-flops or overly revealing clothing. If the company culture is more casual, that doesn’t automatically mean you should dress like them for your interview, Haller said. Those employees have already had the chance to show over time that they do great work despite how they’re dressed, but they don’t know you yet. You need to make a good impression that shows you’re respectful and serious. At the same time, don’t go overboard by wearing a three-piece suit and appearing totally out of touch, Haller said — unless that’s the dress code. Bring all those notes you prepared to the interview, but don’t bring your parents. That can imply immaturity and incapability, and you’re the one who needs to be able to do the job without them. Where you do the interview is also important. The setting should be as distraction- and noise-free as possible, so avoid conducting it from a public space, such as a coffeeshop. Turning your camera off is generally inappropriate, experts said, and it can suggest you’re hiding something or uncomfortable dealing with people — which is obviously a concerning red flag since most jobs require dealing with people. If you for a question, ask the interviewer to rephrase or say “I don’t have much experience with that particular issue, but I can tell you about a time when X.” You can also say you would like an opportunity to really think about the question if they would let you get back to them with an answer. These alternatives show you’re adaptable, and they allow you to show off in other ways. When you’re given the chance to ask questions, ask what you’ve prepared. But save questions about salary, availability expectations and vacation benefits for a point towards the end of the interview, Mondragon said. These questions are important for your survival and quality of life, something Gen Z cares more about than previous generations — which is a great thing, he added. Some states, such as Colorado and New York, have even required that job postings state the salary. But you don’t want to appear to care more about not working than working. you ask also matters. “Can you tell me about the company’s benefits packages for employees at this level?” sounds better than “How many days off do I get?” At the end, ask if there’s anything else you could provide to show you’re a great candidate for the position, Haller said. “You want to overcome any objections. And then you always want to ask about the next steps and express your interest.” Within 24 hours after the interview, email a thank you note expressing gratitude for the interviewer’s time and the opportunity, Haller said. But know that your message is more than a thank you note — it’s also an indirect reminder to hire you. If you get a call for another interview or a job offer, respond as immediately as possible, experts said. Even if you’re no longer interested, you should still quickly communicate that, too — it’s the respectful thing to do, and you don’t want to burn any bridges you may need to cross again in the future. Do not follow up with an employer about whether there’s any news before the time they said they’ll be in touch, Roulin said. After that is when you can check in once a week. If a month or two go by, no response from them is your answer, Haller said — and you shouldn’t work for companies that treat people that way.

    "content": "It’s April 15 — otherwise known as “Tax Day” in the United States. While the IRS has already received a majority of the 2024 federal income tax returns typically filed by Tax Day — 101.422 million as of April 4, to be precise — US tax filers are expected to send in tens of millions more by today. But the agency also expects to receive millions more returns in the months ahead due to the automatic extensions the IRS granted to people in federally declared disaster areas. At current count, all residents and businesses in seven states have already been granted filing and payment extensions, on top of people in select areas of other states. More on that below. Plus, millions of individual filers have requested — or will request today — automatic six-month filing extensions because they won’t make the April 15 deadline. If you are racing to file your return today — or think you won’t make it in time — here are some last-minute tips to keep in mind. If you’re starting cold, make sure you pull together all the documents you’ll need to fill out your return. You’ll want to look for income reporting forms from your employer (a for your earnings) or from your clients if you’re (a or ). You may even get a from any payment apps you use like Venmo if you received payments for your goods or services. If you are receiving any income distributions from an IRA or pension, you should have a . Also look for other 1099 forms from your bank and brokerage for other types of income you received during the year (e.g., interest, dividends and capital gains). All these forms will have been sent to you by mail, electronically or both. Consider, too, any major changes that took place in your life in 2024 that could affect your taxes either through new tax breaks or new types of reportable income — for instance, if you got married, had children, received alimony, started a small business on the side, bought or sold a home, inherited an IRA or collected unemployment benefits. Most filers now take the standard deduction — a flat amount you deduct from your income ($14,600 for single filers and those who are married filing separately; $29,200 for married couples filing jointly; and $21,900 for head-of-household filers). But if the standard deduction amounts to less than the total of the value of itemized deductions you’re eligible to take (e.g., state and local taxes, mortgage interest, charitable contributions, etc.) you . If you do, gather the documentation you will need to back up those deductions (e.g. a for mortgage interest from your lender, contribution receipts from charities, etc.). Speaking of deductions, if you qualify to deduct contributions to a traditional tax-deferred IRA, you can put away up to $7,000 ($8,000 if you’re 50 or older) by 11:59 pm on April 15 and still have it count as your 2024 contribution. Since it’s an “above-the-line deduction” you’re allowed to take it even if you claim the standard deduction. Here are the eligibility rules if you and . If you have a fairly straightforward tax situation with a household income below $250,000, and if you take the standard deduction and only a handful of credits pertaining mostly to family, you may be eligible to use the . ( how to figure out if it would be right for you.) The Direct File option is currently available in 25 states: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington State, Wisconsin and Wyoming. The program works on mobile phones, laptops, tablets or desktop computers. And it will help guide you to fill out your state tax return, too. You also can using one of several private-sector tax preparation software . These free filing options, however, are for those with adjusted gross incomes of $84,000 or less. Other eligibility criteria may apply. Whether you’re preparing your return on your own, working with a tax preparer or using Direct File, you always want to double check that everything is correct on your return before submitting it. Dopey little mistakes — getting a number wrong, misspelling your name, selecting the wrong filing status, etc. — the processing of your return. And if you’re due a refund, those errors could delay that money getting to you. If possible, electronically file your return, which is generally considered to be safer and faster, according to the . While April 15 is the deadline for most US tax filers, there are certain groups of filers whose official due date is later this year, such as people living and working in certain . This now includes all the residents and businesses operating in seven states: , , , , , and . It also includes some US citizens ; and But if you’re not among any of those groups and you really can’t file your taxes today, do these three things before 11:59 p.m. local time tonight: File for an . If you think you still owe money to the IRS for tax year 2024, it must be paid by Tuesday, even if you request a filing extension. One way to ballpark whether you still do is to multiply your 2024 income by 20% and make sure that you have already paid that much, according to Tom O’Saben, director of tax content at the National Association of Tax Professionals. If you haven’t, send the IRS the difference. Send that payment no later than 11:59 pm tonight. If you’re mailing it, do so by , so you’ll have confirmation that it was sent and received. If you can’t pay all that you owe, pay however much you can by April 15, then explore the you can make with the IRS. If you don’t file and haven’t requested an extension — or if you don’t pay the rest of what you owe the IRS for 2024 today — you may be subject to a failure-to-file penalty equal to 5% of the balance you owe plus interest for every month you don’t file; and/or a failure-to-pay penalty equal to to 0.5% of what you owe plus interest every month until you pay in full.",

    "author": "Clare Duffy",
    "publication_date": "2025-05-19T14:01:10.585Z",
    "cate": "business",
    "content": "More than 100 organizations are raising alarms about a provision in the House’s sweeping tax and spending cuts package that would hamstring the regulation of artificial intelligence systems. Tucked into President Donald Trump’s agenda bill is a rule that, if passed, would prohibit states from enforcing “any law or regulation regulating artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence systems, or automated decision systems” for 10 years. With AI rapidly advancing and extending into more areas of life — such as personal communications, health care, hiring and policing — blocking states from enforcing even their own laws related to the technology could harm users and society, the organizations said. They laid out their concerns in a letter sent Monday to members of Congress, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries. “This moratorium would mean that even if a company deliberately designs an algorithm that causes foreseeable harm — regardless of how intentional or egregious the misconduct or how devastating the consequences — the company making or using that bad tech would be unaccountable to lawmakers and the public,” the letter, provided exclusively to CNN ahead of its release, states. The bill cleared a key hurdle when the House Budget Committee voted to advance it on Sunday night, but it still must undergo a series of votes in the House before it can move to the Senate for consideration. The 141 signatories on the letter include academic institutions such as the University of Essex and Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy and Technology, and advocacy groups such as the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Economic Policy Institute. Employee coalitions such as Amazon Employees for Climate Justice and the Alphabet Workers Union, the labor group representing workers at Google’s parent company, also signed the letter, underscoring how widely held concerns about the future of AI development are. “The AI preemption provision is a dangerous giveaway to Big Tech CEOs who have bet everything on a society where unfinished, unaccountable AI is prematurely forced into every aspect of our lives,” said Emily Peterson-Cassin, corporate power director at non-profit Demand Progress, which drafted the letter. “Speaker Johnson and Leader Jeffries must listen to the American people and not just Big Tech campaign donations,” Peterson-Cassin said in a statement. The letter comes as Trump has rolled back some of the limited federal rules for AI that had been existed prior to his second term. Shortly after taking office this year, Trump a designed to provide at least some safeguards around artificial intelligence. He also said he would on the export of critical US AI chips earlier this month. Ensuring that the United States remains the global leader in AI, especially in the face of heightened competition from China, has been one of the president’s . “We believe that excessive regulation of the AI sector could kill a transformative industry just as it’s taking off,” heads of state and CEOs at the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in February. US states, however, have increasingly moved to regulate some of the highest risk applications of AI in the absence of significant federal guidelines. Colorado, for example, passed a last year requiring tech companies to protect consumers from the risk of algorithmic discrimination in employment and other crucial decisions, and inform users when they’re interacting with an AI system. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, earlier this year that creates civil and criminal penalties for people who distribute misleading AI-generated deepfake content. And Ohio lawmakers are that would require watermarks on AI-generated content and prohibit identity fraud using deepfakes. Multiple state legislatures have also regulating the use of AI-generated deepfakes in elections. That some applications of AI should be regulated has been a rare point of bipartisan agreement on Capitol Hill. On Monday, President Donald Trump is set to sign into law the Take It Down Act, which will make it illegal to share non-consensual, AI-generated explicit images, which passed both the House and Senate with support from both sides of the aisle. The budget bill provision would run counter to the calls from some tech leaders for more regulation of AI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman testified to a Senate subcommittee in 2023 that “regulatory intervention by governments will be critical to mitigate the risks of increasingly powerful models.” More recently on Capitol Hill, Altman said he agreed that a risk-based approach to regulating AI “makes a lot of sense,” although he urged federal lawmakers to create clear guidelines to help tech companies navigating a patchwork of state regulations. “We need to make sure that companies like OpenAI and others have legal clarity on how we’re going to operate. Of course, there will be rules. Of course, there need to be some guardrails,” he said. But, he added, “we need to be able to understand how we’re going to offer services, and where the rules of the road are going to be.”",

    "content": ". There is a “first of its kind” crypto bill making progress through the Senate that you’re going to be tempted to snooze on because a) it’s about “stablecoins,” which is a subcategory of crypto – a parallel financial system almost no one understands, and b) opponents are focusing their criticism on corruption, which may be accurate but perhaps you’re tired of reading all the news about the Trump family’s alleged use of the power of the presidency to make a profit? (ICYMI: see , , and .) But there’s a big planting-seeds-for-the-next-financial-crisis kind of reason why you should understand what this bill is. So let’s get into it. The crypto industry-backed bill is called GENIUS, or “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins.” Stablecoins are a digital asset designed to maintain a 1-to-1 peg with the dollar (or other traditional, “stable” currency). One stablecoin should always equal one dollar, forever and ever. They are essentially a way for crypto investors to keep their cash in the crypto universe, where tokens like bitcoin and ether and solana tend to swing wildly in value. They aren’t nearly as well known as bitcoin, the biggest crypto by market value. But in terms of trading volume, stablecoins are by far the biggest players. The crypto industry wants the Genius bill because it would lay down, for the first time in the industry’s 16-year history, rules of the road for a key sector of their business. Which, of course, encourages greater adoption of crypto and thus makes them more money. The bill would require stablecoins to, among other things, hold reserves of safe, liquid assets like US dollars and Treasury bills, and publicly disclose those holdings monthly. It would also place some light restrictions on publicly traded companies that want to issue their own stablecoins (more on that in a moment). But “the bill is light on consumer safeguards and limitations to corporations’ ability to issue their own stablecoins,” said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University professor of international trade and the author of the 2021 book “The Future of Money.” “Moreover, the Trump administration’s boosterism of crypto and light-touch approach to regulation suggests that any such safeguards and limitations will not be enforced with much force,” Prasad added. There’s the potential for corruption, as Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other critics have been shouting from the rafters. In fact, Democrats initially refused to vote for the bill in part because of Trump’s schemes, such as the private dinner taking place this week among the biggest holders of his $TRUMP memecoin, a kind of token whose only purpose is to attract money for its issuer. The White House has repeatedly pushed back on any questions about the president’s potential ethical conflicts, from his interest in accepting a luxury jet from Qatar to his family’s crypto holdings. (“This White House holds ourselves to the highest of ethical standards,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this month.) Not much has changed in the bill between then and now. But some Democrats dropped their opposition anyway, likely because they’re just accepting the “apparent inevitability of blockchain-based finance and of crypto more generally,” Prasad said. One of those Democrats was Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia who defended his reversal on the bill Monday. “Many senators, myself included, have very real concerns about the Trump family’s use of crypto technologies to evade oversight, hide shady financial dealings, and personally profit at the expense of everyday Americans,” Warner said in a statement.  “But we cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay. If American lawmakers don’t shape it, others will – and not in ways that serve our interests or democratic values.” The Trump family owns a crypto platform called World Liberty Financial, which issues a stablecoin called USD1. A few weeks ago, an Abu Dhabi investment firm called MGX chose USD1 to finance a $2 billion investment in crypto exchange Binance ( ). That is “essentially giving Trump a cut of this enormous financial deal,” Warren said Monday in prepared remarks. So, yeah, it sure looks like once again Trump could get richer off an industry he directly oversees through a regulatory apparatus he is rapidly working to defang. Meanwhile, the crypto industry has plowed millions of dollars into industry Super PACs that gave heavily to both Republican and Democratic campaigns last year. No, there’s more! A lot of the focus on corruption is merited, said Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University who has been studying stablecoin policy, in an interview Tuesday. But that’s not what’s keeping her up at night. She referred to the GENIUS bill as “a car crash in slow motion.“ “The thing that makes me lose the most sleep is that this bill would allow the largest tech platforms to essentially become the functional equivalent of banks,” said Allen, who was part of the commission appointed by Congress to study the causes of the 2008 financial crisis. “The last crisis was caused by ‘too big to fail’ financial institutions. The size of some of these tech platforms makes that look quaint.” Let’s step back for a moment. The bill provides almost no resistance for a tech giant like Meta or Amazon or Google to issue its own stablecoin. (In short, companies would have to get approval from a regulatory triad representing the Treasury, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve. As Prasad notes, that isn’t much of a hurdle under Trump’s broadly pro-crypto administration.) Meta already tried to get in on the crypto biz back in 2019 with a project called Libra (later renamed Diem), but abandoned it in 2022 in response to opposition from lawmakers and regulators. Now, according to this month, Meta is once again testing the stablecoin waters, discussing various ways to introduce stablecoins as a means to manage in-app transactions. The benefits for Meta (or whomever) are clear: Stablecoin transactions keep users in the app, and the company then gathers all kinds of valuable information about its users and how they spend their money. But what happens when there’s a run on stablecoins, or some other financial shock that causes those financial businesses to fail? Proponents say there’s no reason to think there’ll be a run on stablecoins if they’ve got 100% cash reserves backing them. Of course, that thinking is premised on a “ridiculously optimistic assumption” that there will never be a run on a stablecoins, Allen says. She notes that money-market mutual funds are “almost identical in structure,” and are not immune from the kind of panic that causes bank runs. “Money-market mutual funds experienced runs that required bailouts in 2008 and again in 2020, so “I think runs on stablecoins are likely.” In fact, she notes, the government has already had to bail out a stablecoin when Silicon Valley Bank failed in 2023. The lender has more than $3 billion worth of a stablecoin called USDC among its vast uninsured deposits. “We may be setting ourselves up to essentially have to bail out these large tech platforms,” Allen says.",

Richard Grenell, who is both Trump’s presidential envoy for special missions and the newly installed , was named to the Live Nation board on Tuesday. Live Nation, the parent company of Ticketmaster, has been trying to fend off a massive lawsuit by the US government and 30 state and district attorneys general. The prosecutors say Live Nation has abused its concert industry dominance and should be broken up. Antitrust advocates immediately connected the Grenell appointment to Live Nation’s ongoing efforts to defeat the suit. “Ticketmaster just put Trump advisor Richard Grenell on its board of directors to get out from under the Antitrust Division’s lawsuit against the company,” Matt Stoller . Stoller is the research director for the American Economic Liberties Project, a nonprofit group that has urged the Trump administration to continue the lawsuit. Trump’s transactional nature and track record of using government power to and have led some companies to seek cozy relationships with the president and his inner circle, whether through corporate donations, CEO photo ops, board appointments or other methods. Live Nation, however, said Grenell’s career experience will “help support Live Nation’s mission to bring more live music to the world, while also advocating for industry reforms that protect both fans and artists.” Grenell once expressed interest in running for governor in California, and has numerous Hollywood connections, but he doesn’t bring extensive entertainment industry experience to the board. He served in multiple diplomatic and intelligence positions throughout Trump’s first presidential term. He has also been a paid contributor to both Fox News and Newsmax, where he stood out for his combative posture toward Trump critics. Live Nation also faces a criminal probe by the Justice Department into the handling of concert cancellations at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. When the probe last week, Live Nation denied any wrongdoing and said it would defend itself “vigorously” if the government brought any charges.",

    "content": "Summer’s usually a boom time for airlines. This year could change that. Airlines began 2025 projecting strong growth. But since then, one issue after another has cut into passenger demand. Air traffic control problems are causing , feeding into traveler worries over safety that began in January with the worst US air crash in decades. A global trade war and other economic concerns are driving down the , making overseas travel more expensive for Americans. Meanwhile, foreign travelers are staying away either in protest over actions by the Trump administration or due to immigration concerns. There are also new security rules requiring airlines passengers upgrade to a “ ” to get through TSA checkpoints, which could keep some passengers from flying. Add to that a general concern about the economy, and what’s usually a key money-making time for the airlines could fall short this year. “It really is a perfect storm of a lot of things affecting the airlines,” said William McGee, senior fellow for aviation and travel at the American Economic Liberties Project think tank. “Summer is definitely going to be softer for the airlines. And summer is where the biggest part of the money is made.” Instead of gearing up to make big profits, airlines are cutting back flight routes for the rest of the year to save money, stepping away from earlier optimistic earnings guidance. Airline stocks measured by the NYSE Arca Airline Index have lost more than 20% of their value since January 29, the date of the fatal crash at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. That was the first high-profile airline incident this year, but it was far from the last. Since then, there has been of a Delta regional jet as well as reports of near-collisions on the ground, and in the air, at various airports across the United States. After the fatal crash in Washington, DC, Delta CEO Ed Bastian said the airline saw an immediate drop in ticket sales as more passengers became . “It caused a lot of shock among consumers,” he said at an investors conference in March﻿. “We saw a pretty immediate stall in both corporate travel and bookings. Consumer confidence and certainty in air travel started to wane a little bit as questions of safety came in.” haven’t been helped by recent reports of air traffic controllers overseeing flights at Newark Liberty International Airport briefly . There were no crashes as a result of , but it did cause some controllers to put in for trauma leave. The drop in staffing led to at one of the nation’s key airport hubs. “I’ve had more friends, colleagues and acquaintances say they don’t want to fly right now than normal, not because they’re scared of crashes, but because they don’t want to deal with delays and cancellations,” said McGee. Flyers aren’t staying away just because of safety concerns and potential delays – there’s also worries about the broader economy. this month plunged to levels below those seen during the Great Recession. The Conference Board’s confidence survey found in April that Americans intending to fly in the next six months fell 12.5% from January. International travel, an important profit driver for the nation’s three largest airlines, has been hit particularly hard. According to analysis by aviation analytics firm Cirium, bookings from the United States to Europe from June through August through third-party sources like online travel sites fell 9.8% compared to a year ago. And it’s even worse in reverse, with 12% fewer bookings on flights from Europe to the United States. Then there is the Real ID requirement for boarding flights, which could be keeping travelers away from airports until they can upgrade their drivers’ license, which can take . So far, the new security rule has had little apparent impact on travelers, according to one airline executive who spoke to CNN on background. About 7% of Americans are showing up at TSA checkpoints without a Real ID or an alternate form of allowable identification, such as a passport or military ID, according to a TSA spokesperson. But the agency said many of those without the Real ID or equivalent are being after additional screening. The TSA expects to end exceptions later this year. The airlines have weathered worse situations in the past. The pandemic brought flying to a near-halt, requiring federal bailouts. The September 11 terrorist attack was followed by a string of bankruptcies and mergers. There have been massive financial losses due to previous spikes in fuel prices. But as the airlines begin a summer where they had expected smooth flying, they’re about to experience some unpleasant financial turbulence.",

    "title": "\n      Who benefits most from the state and local tax deduction and why raising the cap is contentious\n    ",

    "content": "Increasing the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction could benefit millions of tax filers. But a proposal to do just that has become a to House Republicans’ passing “one big, beautiful bill” that reflects President Donald Trump’s agenda. That agenda includes making permanent essentially all of the individual income tax provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which are otherwise scheduled to expire this year. The SALT deduction, as it is known, enables federal income tax filers to deduct either their state and local income taxes or their state and local general sales taxes. In addition, they are also allowed to deduct their property taxes, assuming their income or sales taxes don’t put them over the cap. The tax break, however, may only be taken by those who itemize deductions on their federal returns, which only a minority of filers do. Prior to 2017, there was no limit on the SALT deduction. But the TCJA imposed a $10,000 cap — which, when coupled with the expanded standard deduction under that tax law, meant the number of people who claimed the SALT deduction fell dramatically — from about one-quarter of filers in 2017, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, to less than 10% today. Going forward, it appears there will still be a cap, but it likely will be higher than $10,000. The question is just how much higher and for whom? The House Ways and Means and House Budget committees already approved a tax package that would permanently raise the cap to $30,000 for any taxpayer whose modified adjusted gross income is $400,000 or less if married filing jointly (and $200,000 or less for single filers). But anyone above those income thresholds would still be able to deduct at least $10,000, according to the Tax Foundation. But a small group of House Republicans with constituents who benefit from the tax break publicly rejected the proposal. By Wednesday morning, House Speaker Mike Johnson said a with the so-called SALT caucus to raise the cap to $40,000 for a decade for households making less than $500,000. For those making more, the cap would be reduced gradually between $500,000 and $800,000. Households making more than $800,000 would be able to deduct $10,000. What’s not clear is whether that compromise, if finalized, will be accepted by conservatives who dislike the SALT deduction and have been insisting on deep spending cuts. Republicans introduced the cap as part of their 2017 tax cuts bill to help pay for the sweeping legislation. And they are hoping to use it again as a revenue raiser in this year’s package. For example, the $30,000 cap proposal was estimated to raise $915.6 billion over 10 years relative to simply letting the cap expire as it is otherwise set to do if lawmakers don’t act, according to estimates from the Joint Committee on Taxation. A higher cap covering more households, like that reached in the tentative agreement Wednesday, will result in less revenue gained. That may further fuel the intraparty battle over the SALT deduction between GOP lawmakers from high-tax blue states, such as California and New York, and their colleagues from lower-tax red states, whose residents don’t benefit from the deduction nearly as much. And even if all House GOP can get on board, it’s not clear where the Senate, which is expected to amend the final House tax-and-spending bill, will come down. It’s hardly the first time SALT has been the subject of dispute in modern times, said tax historian Joe Thorndike. The SALT break has been on the books since 1913, when the federal income tax code was created. It also had a decade-long stint during the Civil War as well. But there have been efforts to limit the deduction over the past five decades. While originally the SALT deduction was created so that the federal government didn’t encroach upon states’ ability to collect revenue, SALT today is portrayed as a subsidy to high-tax states and as regressive in that it disproportionately benefits higher-income households, Thorndike noted. In 2020, the SALT deduction was claimed on just 8.6% of all federal tax returns, according to the Tax Policy Center. But the incidence of people claiming it was most concentrated in 13 states and the District of Columbia. The deduction was claimed on more than 20% of returns from Maryland and Washington, DC; and on 10% to 20% of returns filed by residents of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Utah, Virginia and Washington State. And those who have received the biggest break — both before and after the cap was imposed — are high-income filers, especially those in high-tax states and cities. In 2017, before the cap went into effect, for example, roughly two-thirds of the benefit went to those with incomes of $200,000 or more, according to the center. The average SALT deduction was about $13,000, but it topped $30,000 in eight counties, mostly in California and New York. While the vast majority of middle- and upper-income households received tax relief from TCJA regardless of where they lived, they would have received even more, had the cap not been instituted, said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the TPC. For example, the tax cut for those in the top 20% would have been $2,500 larger, on average, had their state and local tax deductions not been limited, according to the center. Their average individual income tax cut was only about $6,200, instead of $8,700. The cap had an even greater impact on taxpayers in the top 1%, whose average tax cut was $40,100, instead of $71,000. But those in the bottom 80% would not have seen much of a change in the size of their tax cut had the cap not been put in place.",

    "content": "Dior has agreed a number of remedies to settle an Italian competition authority investigation into whether the luxury brand and two of its units misled consumers with their statements about working conditions at its suppliers. The antitrust body said Wednesday that the pledges made by Dior, which is owned by LVMH, were an appropriate remedy for the possible unlawfulness and decided to close the investigation “without establishing any infringement.” Dior’s commitments include paying €2 million ($2.3 million) over five years to support initiatives aimed at helping victims of labor exploitation. Last year prosecutors in Milan uncovered workshops where underpaid workers, often immigrants who were in the country illegally, produced leather bags then sold to Dior and Armani for a tiny fraction of their retail price. This led Italy’s antitrust investigation to open an investigation into whether the luxury brands had misled consumers, focusing on the discrepancies between the reality uncovered by the judicial labor probes and the messages from brands to consumers in terms of craftsmanship and corporate social responsibility. Among the remedies, Dior also committed to making changes to its ethical and social responsibility statements and to adopting stricter procedures to select and monitor suppliers, the authority said Wednesday. In a separate statement, the company said: “Dior partnered closely with the Authority to define a robust set of commitments that increase transparency and strengthen oversight throughout its supply chain.” Italian consumer group Codacons said the investigation’s outcome was too lenient, given the small size of the financial commitments and the fact that no fine was handed down. Last year prosecutors appointed commissioners to oversee Dior and Armani’s units that outsourced the handbag production, to ensure they fix their supply chain problems. The special administration regime was lifted earlier this year. Last week, an Italian court placed a unit of fashion brand Valentino under judicial administration for a year after uncovering worker abuse inside its supply chain.",

    "content": ", the veteran former Apple design chief credited with shaping the company’s product design, is joining ChatGPT maker OpenAI. OpenAI will merge with Ive’s tech company, io, according to from Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. The deal is said to be valued at about $6.5 billion, according to reports from , and other media outlets. OpenAI previously held a 23% stake in io, according to . Spokespeople for OpenAI did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment regarding the deal’s valuation. Ive and his separate design firm, LoveFrom, will take on design responsibilities for OpenAI and io, according to an announcement video on OpenAI’s website.

The collaboration comes at a critical time for tech companies, which are racing to incorporate AI into their software and build new products fueled by the technology, from to and new types of . “I think we have the opportunity here to kind of completely reimagine what it means to use a computer,” Altman said in the video. Ive had been collaborating with OpenAI for two years, according to the announcement. He has been working with OpenAI on a product that “uses A.I. to create a computing experience that is less socially disruptive than the iPhone,” reported in September. Altman said in the video that he had recently been given a prototype of the device, which he described as “the coolest piece of technology the world will have ever seen.” No concrete details have emerged about the product. Ive in Apple’s product design, from the iPhone to the iMac and even the company’s Apple Park headquarters. He after nearly 30 years to start his own firm. Ive has largely been credited with establishing Apple’s iconic sleek aesthetic and reviving the company’s fortunes in the late 1990s. When Ive departed the company, CEO Tim Cook said in a press release that his “role in Apple’s revival cannot be overstated.” OpenAI is perceived to be the front-runner in the consumer AI space; its popular ChatGPT chatbot thrust AI into the spotlight in late 2022, prompting tech giants and startups to shape their products around the technology. Apple partners with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its Siri virtual assistant. Ive’s and Altman’s announcement comes a day after Google outlined its plans to release AI-powered smart glasses, a product it believes could be the next iteration of the personal computer. Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses have already been a relative hit with consumers; at least 2 million pairs have been sold. But some new styles of tech devices built around the promise of facilitating AI interactions, like the , have fallen flat with consumers. “The products that we’re using to deliver and connect us to unimaginable technology, they’re decades old,” Ive said in the video. “And so it’s just common sense to at least think surely there’s something beyond these legacy products.”",

    "content": "Markets thought they had a serious . Now they have a trade war problem to worry about again. Stocks and the dollar fell Friday after President Donald Trump brought the trade war back to the forefront with threats of massive tariffs against one of America’s most valuable companies and one of its most important trading partners. Trump posted on Truth social Friday morning that he would impose a if it refused to make iPhones in the United States. Minutes later, Trump said he would on goods imported from the European Union. The Dow closed lower by 256 points, or 0.61%. The broader S&P 500 fell 0.67%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slid 1%. All three indexes finished the week in the red. The Dow and Nasdaq each posted their worst week in five weeks. The S&P 500 notched its worst week since the first week of April. Dow futures had tumbled as much as 600 points Friday morning after Trump posted his tariff threat. Stocks opened sharply lower before paring losses throughout the day after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Bloomberg TV interview that he expects “several large deals” will be announced in the coming weeks. Bessent also said he expects US and Chinese officials to meet in person again to continue trade negotiations following a temporary pause on higher tariff rates. While stocks recouped some losses, the major indexes remained in the red as Trump said at the White House in the afternoon he was “not looking for a deal” with the EU. Trump’s stark tariff threats paired with Bessent’s optimistic trade remarks sent Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, on a rollercoaster. The VIX was up 8% in the afternoon after surging as much as 23% in the morning. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar’s strength against six major foreign currencies, slid 0.8%. The dollar index posted its biggest single-day drop in one month and notched its worst week in six weeks. Gold, a safe haven during uncertainty, surged 2%. “Markets once again face the fear of high tariffs on a major trading partner,” said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at US Bank Asset Management. “We believe that this morning’s social media posts about a 50% tariff on the EU are primarily a negotiating tactic,” analysts at Barclays said in a Friday note. “But today’s developments, including the posts about iPhones, do highlight that the US has not turned the page on tariffs and that more trade policy volatility lies ahead.” Wall Street in recent weeks had begun to shift focus away from tariffs and toward Trump’s — its own — after the United States and China in May opened trade negotiations and agreed to substantially lower tariffs, easing investors’ nerves about the trade war. But Trump’s new threat of tariffs on the EU was a sharp reminder that policy uncertainty remains. David Doyle, head of economics at Macquarie, said in a recent note that it is not “all-clear” on the trade war front, and tariffs remain a “substantial headwind” to the US economy. “Today’s early market action does not approve of a threat directed at another corporate, and the idea of a 50% EU tariff rate,” analysts at Citi said in a Friday note. “This is sure giving us déjà vu.” The S&P 500 sank in early April after Trump announced massive “reciprocal” tariffs, and rebounded sharply after the president a week later announced a 90-day pause on most of them. Investors have been on edge about potential developments during the 90-day pause, which is set to end in July. “This calls into question whether investors can trust that any pauses announced by the Administration are actually solid, which only further muddies the landscape,” said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird. “Expect volatility to persist.” Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments, said the market reaction to Trump’s threat of 50% tariffs on the EU will likely be more “measured” than past tariff announcements because “the playbook now involves a high likelihood of Trump caving at some point.” “But the uncertain timing and not-zero chance that he doesn’t cave will keep equities on edge for the next couple of weeks, at least,” Ladner said. The United States so far during the 90-day pause has only announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom. Apple ( ) on Friday dropped 3% after Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on the company’s products unless it moves manufacturing to the United States. The tech giant has tumbled 22% this year as it has been caught in the crossfire of Trump’s trade war. Apple’s market value dipped back below the $3 trillion mark on Friday as its stock stumbled. And it’s not just Big Tech taking a hit. Retirement plans like 401(k)s are often invested in funds that track the S&P 500, and large companies like Apple make up a notable portion of the index’s value. As Trump’s trade war roils blue-chip stocks like Apple, it can impact people’s retirement savings. “You just can’t continue to keep an economy and companies operating in a cloud of extraordinarily high uncertainty forever without some economic consequences eventually,” Ladner said. “That’s going to be the tug of war the next several months.” The tariff jolt on Friday comes after markets this week have already been floundering under pressure from the bond market. Investors this week balked at Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax bill, and weak demand for US government bonds sent yields surging. “Markets are looking for a little more fiscal discipline, they’re concerned,” Federal Reserve Governor Chris Waller told Fox Business on Thursday. “There does seem to be, you know, a risk-off on American assets across the board, not just government debt, but everything,” Waller said. “And whether that continues in the future or not, I don’t know.” The yield on the 10-year Treasury note on Friday edged lower to 4.51% as investors scooped up bonds amid renewed trade uncertainty. In Europe, markets tumbled after Trump’s threat of a higher tariff for the region that could go into effect June 1. The benchmark STOXX 600 index fell 0.93%. Germany’s DAX fell 1.54% and France’s CAC index slid 1.65%. The S&P 500 posted its fourth day of losses in a row as the recent rebound in US markets has stalled. The benchmark index is down slightly on the year. CNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald contributed reporting.",

    "content": "President Donald Trump announced a partnership between U.S. Steel and Japanese steelmaker Nippon that he says will keep the headquarters in Pittsburgh and draw $14 billion in investment toward the US economy. “This will be a planned partnership between United States Steel and Nippon Steel, which will create at least 70,000 jobs, and add $14 Billion Dollars to the U.S. Economy. The bulk of that Investment will occur in the next 14 months,” Trump on TruthSocial Friday. Trump will visit the steel plant next Friday for a “BIG rally,” he said. But Trump’s post included few details about what’s included in the deal, such as whether this is truly a partnership instead of an acquisition and how much control would remain with U.S. Steel. Former president Joe Biden blocked the $14.3 billion acquisition during his last week in office. The deal has been controversial since it was first announced in December 2023, with both sides of the political aisle opposing foreign control of a once-key component of US industrial might that has fallen on hard times. Trump found rare convergence with Biden when also began his term opposed to an outright deal. “I don’t want US Steel being owned by a foreign country. All they can have is an investment,” Trump said. But in March, the Trump administration signaled it in a lawsuit U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel filed against the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which scrutinizes foreign investments for national security risks. CFIUS into the acquisition in April, and submitted a recommendation to Trump on whether any of the measures proposed by the companies would mitigate national security risks on Wednesday, Reuters . Nippon raised its investment pledge in US Steel’s operations to $14 billion, which would include a new $4 billion steel mill in the US, if its bid was greenlit, according to . US Steel was once a when it was the in the world and the first to be worth $1 billion, soon after its creation in 1901. It was also crucial to the US economy and the cars, appliances, bridges and skyscrapers that tangibly indicated that strength. But it has suffered through decades of decline since its post-World War II height. It is no longer even the largest US steelmaker, and a relatively minor employer, with 14,000 US employees — 11,000 of whom are members of the United Steel Workers union. But it is still not a company that politicians who enjoy talking about American greatness have wanted to see fall into foreign hands — particularly in the politically significant state of Pennsylvania. US Steel called Trump “a bold leader and businessman” in a statement Friday. “U.S. Steel will remain American, and we will grow bigger and stronger through a partnership with Nippon Steel that brings massive investment, new technologies and thousands of jobs over the next four years,” the company said in a statement to CNN. The deal had sparked fierce opposition from the union, saying it was concerned the Nippon would not maintain a long-term commitment to the remaining unionized mills. In a press release Thursday, the United Steel Workers said that allowing US Steel to be sold to Nippon would “be a disaster for American Steelworkers, our national security and the future of American manufacturing.” “President Trump has publicly pledged to block this sale since January 2024. We now urge him to act decisively, shutting the door once and for all on this corporate sellout of American Steelworkers and defending U.S. manufacturing,” the release said. But Republican Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick applauded the partnership, saying it ensures “that U.S. Steel remains under U.S. control” in a Friday statement, although he too did not detail how the deal would work. Democratic Senator John Fetterman said the original deal was a “death sentence” in a Friday. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro also praised the partnership, adding that he directly discussed the transaction with Trump in the past few days. “Throughout the entire process, I have maintained that my priority was to keep and grow jobs here in Pennsylvania and get the largest investment we possibly could for our Commonwealth,” he said in a statement Friday. US Steel ( ) stock shot up 21% Friday once the news was announced. CNN has reached out to US Steel, the USW, and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro’s office for comment.",

    "content": "Mike Keech, the CEO of Liquid I.V., thinks you have a problem that you might not even be aware of. “A majority of consumers, Americans and people around the world are chronically dehydrated,” he told CNN. “They just don’t know it.” Even if consumers don’t know if they’re actually suffering from a lack of fluids, they’re still buying like they are. Liquid I.V. has become one of the biggest brands to capitalize on hydration, part of the overall “better for you” wellness trend that’s been within the food and beverage industry over the past several years. Hydration, in particular, has been at the center of social media trends — like #WaterTok on TikTok — and with it growing into a multibillion-dollar market in the next few years. “The category has benefited from changing consumption patterns. It’s no longer just about sports recovery, but about maintaining daily wellness, and managing hangovers,” Nate Rosen, a consumer packaged goods expert, told CNN. “A lot of people simply don’t like plain water and really treat these hydration drinks as a way to flavor their water.” Liquid I.V. launched in 2012, initially targeted toward hardcore athletes recovering from a tough workout. The flavored powder mix is marketed as a healthier alternative to sugar-filled sports drinks, with the potion containing salt, vitamins and electrolytes that support rapid hydration. “The category has been really tired and dusty,” Keech said. “Before, it was a sports person who was sponsored and the idea was, ‘If it’s good enough for them, then it’s good enough for me.’” That was initially a successful proposition and sales soared, prompting Unilever to buy Liquid I.V. for an undisclosed price in 2020. Under Keech, who became CEO of Liquid I.V. following the acquisition, the brand and his team its “positioning it to a much wider audience,” shifting from just sports stars to “the business person, the mom and the gym bunny.” From there, the brand’s distribution doubled and the product has expanded the number of flavors, including a viral firecracker blend, as well as a new sugar-free selection. Liquid I.V. is on track to becoming a $1 billion unit with Unilever labeling it a “power brand” in its most recent earnings report, which has helped its achieve double-digit sales growth. “We recognized that hydration is just not for athletes,” Keech said. “That’s where lift-off happened.” Hydration has largely been dominated for years by liquids, notably Pedialyte, which is commonly used to prevent or treat dehydration in children. But the drink grew in popularity through the mid-2010s as and athletes drank it for recovery. Then there’s , which holds a in the sports drink category, plus Mexico-based Electrolit, which is investing $400 million in a new US plant to meet growing demand. However, powders have recently become a “success story,” according to Howard Telford, head of soft drinks for analytics company Euromonitor. “The big thing is convenience: It’s something that you can have on the kitchen counter, desk drawer at work or in the gym bag. There’s no bulky purchase where you have to allocate space to it in your fridge,” he told CNN. “The flavor profiles are also pretty good for Liquid I.V. as well, which is not nothing.” Keech also credits the convenience factor for Liquid I.V.’s growth, pointing toward festival-goers at Coachella, which it sponsors, as an example. “You can’t just rock out with all sorts of water bottles,” he said. “That’s helps us hydrate people in ways others can’t.” Sales of powdered mixes has achieved double-digit sales growth for the past four consecutive years, most recently growing 20% in 2024, ballooning into a $1.5 billion category, according to Circana, a Chicago-based market research firm. The growth has sparked new entrants for portable mixes ranging from Gatorade, who’s sales of enhancers has grown 200% over the last four years, and Coca-Cola’s BodyArmor to smaller startups like diet-friendly LMNT and the Novak Djokovic-backed Waterdrop — all in hopes of emulating market leader Liquid I.V.’s popularity. “When one brand achieves significant traction in a space, numerous fast followers emerge, especially when the original doesn’t own anything truly proprietary beyond a great name,” said Rosen, who writes the . “After all, anyone can produce an electrolyte powder.” BodyArmor, which , has seen a bright spot in growth with its Flash I.V. hydration drinks and powders. Both products generated $120 million in sales in its first year. The space “saw a big jump in consumption during Covid because people started to realize how important hydration was. There’s also a very heightened sense for longevity as a well, immunity and also overall addition of vitamins into your body,” BodyArmor CEO Federico Muyshondt told CNN. Liquid I.V. is “obsessed with science,” Keech said, adding that it spends a “very significant amount of money on clinical studies to make sure that we can stand by the claims we make.” A page on Liquid I.V.’s website claims its product has “superior hydration” compared to simply drinking water, proclaiming that if you’re thirsty “then you already may be dehydrated.” However, Heidi Skolnik, a senior sports nutritionist at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, is skeptical that dehydration is a common problem for people with unrestricted water access and that people being “chronically dehydrated is probably an overstatement.” “Athletes and active people can benefit from using electrolyte powder and drinks,” she told CNN, but “less active people probably do not need them.” Although for hydrating the average person, she said flavoring it “helps people drink more, so that is a positive and it elevates their awareness of what and how much they are drinking.”",

    "title": "\n      Trump says he’s ‘not looking for a deal’ with the EU after threatening a 50% tariff\n    ",

    "content": "President Donald Trump on Friday threatened a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, citing a lack of progress in current trade negotiations. “Their powerful Trade Barriers, Vat Taxes, ridiculous Corporate Penalties, Non-Monetary Trade Barriers, Monetary Manipulations, unfair and unjustified lawsuits against Americans Companies, and more, have led to a Trade Deficit with the U.S. of more than $250,000,000 a year, a number which is totally unacceptable,” he wrote in a Truth Social post Friday morning. “Our discussions with them are going nowhere!” Trump wrote. “Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.” But later Friday, at an executive order signing in the Oval Office, Trump escalated his message to the EU. “I’m not looking for a deal,” he said. “We’ve set the deal — it’s at 50%.” Trump opened the door to pushing his June 1 deadline further, saying, “If somebody comes in and wants to build a plant here, I can talk to them about a little bit of a delay.” After a phone call with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Maroš Šefčovič, European Commissioner for Trade, said a deal between the EU and the US must be based on “mutual respect, and not threats.” “The EU’s fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both,” he wrote in a post on X Friday, adding that the European Commission “remains ready to work in good faith.” “We stand ready to defend our interests,” he said. Shortly after Trump’s Truth Social post on Friday morning, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Fox News interview that the “EU proposals have not been of the same quality that we’ve seen from our other important trading partners.” “I’m not going to negotiate on TV, but I would hope that this would light a fire under the EU,” Bessent said, adding that the “EU has a collective action problem.” The three major European stock market indexes fell sharply after Trump’s post: The benchmark STOXX 600 index was down 1.7%. Germany’s DAX fell 2.4% and France’s CAC index slid 2.2%. London’s FTSE index was 1% down. US stocks also slid, with the Dow opening lower by 480 points, or 1.15%. Stocks came off their lows after Bessent said in a Bloomberg TV interview on Friday that he expects US trade representatives to meet in person with Chinese officials again to continue trade negotiations following a temporary pause in higher tariff rates. The tariff Trump is considering slapping on the EU is more than double the size of the 20% initial “reciprocal” tariff that was briefly in place in April before he swiftly paused those tariffs to allow for further negotiations. The pause is set to expire on July 9. Since the pause, the only trade deal that’s been announced is with the United Kingdom. Bessent declined to share in the earlier Fox interview which country could be next to ink a deal with the US. However, he said talks are “far along with India,” and many Asian countries have presented “very good deals.” “There are 18 important trading partners and, I would say, with the exception of the EU, most are negotiating in very good faith,” he said. Later in the Bloomberg interview he said he believes “over the next couple of weeks we’re going to have several large deals announced.” As he highlighted in his Truth Social post, the president takes particular issue with “non-monetary trade barriers,” as he has repeatedly called them; as well as countries or trading blocs that run trade deficits with the US. Those occur when the US purchases more from another trading partner than that country purchases from the US. Last year, the US ran a $236 billion trade deficit with the EU, according to US Commerce Department data. That’s higher than the figures Trump cited. Regarding non-monetary trade barriers, Trump has called out the EU for having value-added taxes (VATs) as well as digital service taxes (DSTs). VATs are consumption taxes that are calculated such that consumers pay for all taxes that went into building the end product they purchase. However, when the EU exports goods to the US, for instance, a VAT is remitted. Meanwhile, when the US exports goods to the EU, those goods will be charged a VAT. DSTs tax the gross revenue that online firms collect from offering services to users. A country with a DST would be able to tax all revenue collected by large companies that operate online — even if the business is unprofitable. That can include what they collect from selling data, advertising, as well as payments they receive for subscriptions, software and other kinds of online services users pay for. American firms, namely Big Tech companies such as Meta, Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft, are disproportionately affected by DSTs, according to a report published last year by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Earlier this month, the EU previewed a nearly $108 billion retaliatory tariff plan “covering a broad range of industrial and agricultural products” should talks with the US go south, a statement the European Commission published on May 8 said. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a separate statement that day that the EU made a “zero-for-zero” tariff offer and is working on a mutually beneficial solution. “But if and where negotiations fail, we also will act.” “In other words, all instruments, all options stay on the table,” she said. Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin called Trump’s threat “enormously disappointing,” he said in a statement posted on X on Friday. “I welcomed the pause in tariffs until early July to allow for continued negotiations between the EU and the US, and ideally an agreed outcome.” He disputed Bessent’s claim that the EU isn’t negotiating in good faith, adding that “tariffs at the level suggested would not only push prices up, they would grievously damage one of the world’s most dynamic and significant trading relationships, as well as disrupting wider global trade.” French Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin said in a Friday post on X that Trump’s threats “do not help at all during the negotiation period between the European Union and the United States.” “We maintain the same stance: de-escalation but are ready to respond,” he said in a post translated by CNN. Trump’s comments came after another trade-related post on Truth Social that threatened a 25% tariff on Apple if it continues to make the iPhone overseas. The president met with Apple CEO Tim Cook earlier in the week — and also during his trip to the Middle East the week before. Bessent told Fox News on Friday that he also spoke to Cook, and the discussions went well. So it’s unclear what prompted Trump’s morning trade war ramp-up. Cook had previously said that Apple would relocate iPhone production for the United States to India from China to pay a lower tariff cost. Yet Trump last week and on Friday said he was upset that Apple wasn’t making iPhones in the United States.",

    "content": "McDonald’s is pulling the plug on its CosMc’s spinoff just two years after the took off. The chain announced Friday that it’s closing all five locations next month. CosMc’s, named after a little-known alien McDonald’s character, opened in 2023 in response to fast-growing specialty coffee and beverage chains like Dutch Bros., Scooter’s and that have become popular with Gen Z consumers. CosMc’s menu consisted of sweet drinks and light snacks, with the company hoping customers would visit during their afternoon slump. A spinoff was launched because executives thought the customizable drinks would be too much of a strain on its McDonald’s employees, but fewer people customized their drinks than the company thought. Times have also changed since CosMc’s opened: McDonald’s recently reported its as customers pulled back their spending amid economic uncertainty. That likely prompted McDonald’s leadership to focus instead on fixing its core product. McDonald’s said in a that CosMc’s was created because the chain “had the right to win in the fast-growing beverage space” and allowed it to “test new, bold flavors and different technologies and processes – without impacting the existing McDonald’s experience for customers and crew.” Although the CosMc’s locations will disappear, some of the menu items won’t. CEO Chris Kempczinski said in its earnings call this month that the chain is testing new customizable drinks inspired by CosMc’s with some franchisees later this year. CosMc’s locations — four in Texas and one in Illinois — will close at the end of June with their standalone app and loyalty program also being discontinued, the company said.",

    "content": "President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs have given many Americans whiplash. The list of companies announcing price changes as a result is equally daunting. Among the levies Trump has imposed is a 10% baseline tariff for most imports and a 30% tariff on most Chinese goods. Some goods, such as steel and aluminum, face higher rates. Many retailers have issued warnings that they won’t, “eat” the additional costs caused by those import taxes. That means anything from groceries and clothing to toys and cars could cost Americans more. Walmart is one of the latest major retailers to say it would sell more expensive goods soon because Trump’s tariffs are “too high.” Other retailers suggesting they could hike prices soon include Ford, Best Buy and others. Here are some of the companies that could raise prices on everyday items – whether or not companies are directly blaming Trump’s tariffs. Walmart said on April 15 it would increase prices because Trump’s tariffs were “too high,” particularly when it came to products made in China. “We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible. But given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren’t able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins,” Walmart CEO Douglas McMillon said in an earnings call. Price changes at Walmart will likely take effect by the end of May and prices will increase “much more” in June, the company’s chief financial officer John David Rainey, told . On May 6, toy manufacturing giant Mattel said that it would due to tariffs. Chief Executive Ynon Kreiz told investors that “under the current scenarios we are considering” in response to tariffs, he expects 40% to 50% of its products to remain priced at $20 or less. However, he also advocated for zero tariffs on toys and games around the world. Trump threatened Mattel, saying he would “put a 100% tariff on his toys, and he won’t sell one toy in the United States, and that’s their biggest market.” Electronics retailer Best Buy warned during a March earnings call that “vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely.” Some electronic components and devices are temporarily from Trump’s tariffs. That won’t last forever. Nintendo, for instance, delayed the pre-order date for its Switch 2 video game console because of concerns regarding tariffs. The company later pricing for the console won’t change from the initial $450, but the accessories “will experience price adjustments from those announced on April 2 due to changes in market conditions.” The same could happen to any product because of “market conditions,” the company noted. Meanwhile, Lin Tao, CFO of PlayStation maker Sony, said “we may pass on the price” during an earnings call. Chinese retailers Shein and Temu were once largely exempt from tariffs because of the “de minimis” exemption, which spared shipments of goods worth less than $800. But Trump signed an executive order getting rid of the exemption. “Due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs, our operating expenses have gone up. To keep offering the products you love without compromising on quality, we will be making price adjustment starting April 25, 2025,” Temu in a notice similar to an announcement Shein made. Both companies have since raised prices on some products. For instance, listed on Temu and reviewed by CNN had a $61.72 price tag on April 24. The next day, when the pricing changes took effect, they were listed at $70.17. On Shein, CNN noted a cost $4.39. The next day, it cost $8.39, a 91% increase. Imported cars were hit with a 25% tariff and most auto parts face a similar duty, although some automakers can request partial refunds — for now. Ford’s CFO Sherry House said it expects to raise its US car prices as much as 1.5% in the second half of 2025 due to tariffs. The carmaker extended its “ offer through July as consumers rushed to buy cars ahead of Trump’s tariffs. Japanese automaker Subaru has also said it will increase US prices to “offset increased costs,” citing “current market conditions.” Subaru did not specify how much prices could increase. “The changes were made to offset increased costs while maintaining a solid value proposition for the customer,” a Subaru of America spokesperson said in a statement. “Subaru pricing is not based on the country of origin of its products.” Household product maker Procter & Gamble, which owns brands like Pampers, Tide and Charmin, said during an earnings call on April 24 it would consider raising prices in some categories and markets. That same day, CEO Jon Moeller told CNBC that “there will likely” be price increases for consumers because “tariffs are inherently inflationary.” In April, Stanley Black & Decker, which owns power tool brands, by an average of high single-digits because of tariffs. Another round of price increases will come later this year. Adidas said higher costs are likely for products in the US due to Trump’s back-and-forth tariff. “Given the uncertainty around the negotiations between the US and the different exporting countries, we do not know what the final tariffs will be,” Adidas CEO Bjørn Gulden said in an earnings release on April 29. He added that “cost increases due to higher tariffs will eventually cause price increases.” CNN’s Ramishah Maruf, Samantha Delouya, Chris Isidore, Elisabeth Buchwald and Nathaniel Meyersohn contributed to this report.",

    "content": "Journalists who cover the US military say they are extremely concerned by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s constraints on press access at the Pentagon. They say the newest restrictions, outlined Friday night, appear to be “a direct attack on the freedom of the press and America’s right to know what its military is doing.” The sharp words from the Pentagon Press Association came after Hegseth announced “additional credentialing procedures for press at the Pentagon in the interest of national security.” The changes make key parts of the Pentagon building off-limits to journalists unless they have an official escort. Further restrictions are likely in the coming weeks, according to a Pentagon memo that alluded to a forthcoming pledge to protect military secrets and tougher scrutiny of press credentialing. Friday night’s announcement is part of a pattern. Since January, Hegseth and his Trump administration allies have taken numerous steps to stifle independent media. Hegseth, a former Fox News host, has set the tone by assailing his former colleague Jennifer Griffin (Fox’s national security correspondent) and other journalists. Almost as soon as Hegseth took charge, some of the country’s from their dedicated Pentagon workspaces. In what the Defense Department called a “media rotation program,” smaller and explicitly pro-Trump media outlets were offered workspaces. A few weeks later, the Pentagon said the press briefing room would be closed “when not in use for public briefings.” Top Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell, a close friend of Hegseth’s, has only held one press briefing to date. On Friday, Parnell said on X that the access restrictions are “pragmatic changes to protect operational security.” The memo outlining the restrictions said that “while the department remains committed to transparency, the department is equally obligated to protect (classified intelligence) and sensitive information, the unauthorized disclosure of which could put the lives of U.S. service members in danger.” Hegseth himself stood accused of mishandling sensitive information in March when he sent detailed in Yemen to a Signal group that included The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg. The changes announced on Friday will make it more difficult for journalists to reach Hegseth. It will also eliminate “the media’s freedom to freely access press officers for the military services who are specifically hired to respond to press queries,” the Pentagon Press Association pointed out. The association represents scores of journalists who regularly cover the military. In a statement, the association said it has been trying to reach out to Hegseth and his aides “to keep in place a professional working relationship that has persisted for decades,” but to no avail. The association said it is “puzzled” about why the Defense Department “is devoting such attention to restricting Pentagon media instead of engaging with it as senior leaders have long done.” Hegseth’s public comments indicate that he views the media as the opposition. He has denounced what he called the “hoax press” and promoted himself by appearing on Fox opinion shows hosted by his friends. He also enlisted right-wing content creators to increase the Defense Department’s promotional efforts on social media. Podcaster Graham Allen, who helped Hegseth full-time for several months and said Friday that he was moving into a part-time role, dismissed a CBS journalist’s objections to the new restrictions by saying, “ ” But Mike Balsamo, the president of the National Press Club, said independent coverage of the military is in everyone’s interest. “It keeps voters informed, strengthens democratic oversight, and sends a clear message to the world that America stands for openness and accountability,” Balsamo said. “Restricting access doesn’t protect national security. It undermines public trust.”",

    "content": "The American penny isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. The US Treasury Department announced Thursday that it of the one-cent coin it has been minting for more than 230 years. But the penny will still remain legal tender, and will still be in use at thousands of retailers around the country for sometime to come. “If we look at the experience in Canada, for the first year after they stopped making pennies, there’s really no change in transactions,” Jeff Lenard, spokesperson for the National Association of Convenience Stores, told CNN. Convenience stores do more cash transactions than any other group, about 32 million a day, or about 20% of the total number of purchases by their customers, Lenard said. The National Retail Federation, which represents most major US store chains as well as thousands of small retailers, also said it anticipates its members will use pennies even after production stops at some point early next year, although it does anticipate that many will round cash transactions to the nearest nickel once the supply of pennies at banks starts to run short. “Retailers’ primary goal is serving customers and making this transition as seamless as possible,” said Dylan Jeon, senior director of government relations for NRF. There are an estimated 114 billion pennies currently in circulation, but they are “severely underutilized” according to the Treasury department. Many are at home in coin jars or junk drawers, or some other forgotten location gathering dust. The math says that all those pennies could fill a cube roughly 13 stories high. Many people don’t even take them as change, tossing them into the leave-a-penny-take-a-penny dishes at store checkouts. Lenard said the large number of pennies in circulation means that retailers won’t necessary run out of them for a while. But eventually stores won’t be able to get new rolls of pennies from their banks and will start rounding transactions up or down to the nearest nickel. The decision when to do that will rest with each retailer, not official government policy. Electronic transactions such as credit and debit card purchases, will continue to be down to the penny, Lenard said, with only cash transactions being rounded. Even in countries like Canada, where penny production has been discontinued, the penny remains legal tender today. Canada’s finance ministry said pennies retain their value for transactions “indefinitely” despite the fact that it stopped making the coin in 2012. If a customer wants to use pennies to complete a transaction, most retailers are likely to allow them, Lenard said. “There’s a saying in retail, ‘Never lose a customer over a penny,’” he said. “I never really thought of it in these terms, but it applies even more here. I think if someone wants to pay with pennies, most retailers will err on the side of making those customers happy.”",

    "content": "First lady Melania Trump released an audiobook version in her voice of her memoir on Thursday — but she won’t actually be the one narrating it. “I am honored to bring you Melania – The AI Audiobook – narrated entirely using artificial intelligence in my own voice,” she wrote in a . “Let the future of publishing begin.” Trump is far from the first person to use AI this way. But her choice to put the technology and its use in media creation on a bigger stage hints at the bigger role AI may soon play in creating everything from the news articles people read to the videos and shows they watch — and raising questions about whether media jobs will survive the change. “It’s too reductive to say, yes, that’s an inevitable cut in the number of jobs,” Alex Connock, senior fellow in management practice at the University of Oxford’s Saïd Business School, told CNN. “But it’s also fanciful to say there’s going to be no change to how employment works.” Trump’s book will be narrated by an AI-generated copy of her voice that was “created under Mrs. Trump’s direction and supervision,” the product description on her website reads. Experts say using AI for voiceover work is becoming common, especially as tech from companies like Google and ElevenLabs — the firm Trump used to create her AI audiobook — make it easy to turn text-based materials into audio that sounds like a podcast. But Trump’s announcement brought that AI use to the fore. “I don’t think that there’s going to be a rush to (an) immediate replacement of voiceover,” Clay Shirky, vice provost for AI and technology in education at New York University, told CNN. “A lot of these things happen gradually, but it certainly is a milestone.” The Trump audiobook comes as tech giants are launching tools that make it increasingly easy for anyone to generate realistic video and audio with little effort. Within the same week Trump announced her audiobook, Google debuted a more advanced version of its video generation model that can create audio — even dialogue between characters — to match the scene. Late last year, OpenAI released a video creation tool called Sora, which was so popular the company had to because of high demand. The ChatGPT maker earlier this year when its image generation tool for its ability to create pictures resembling the style of Japanese animation company Studio Ghibli. But that doesn’t mean AI-generated feature films are coming anytime soon. The current version of the technology is ideal for creating short form videos you might find on social media, according to Shirky. What’s more likely is that TV networks and production companies will look for new ways to incorporate AI into existing programs. Connock, who consults with TV production companies, says he’s had multiple meetings this week alone with those in the TV industry looking to learn more about AI, which he says is a major change from a year ago. Connock says producers are curious about creating AI replicas of TV personalities that viewers can interact with while watching their show. He attributes the increased interest to a desire to keep up with social media creators. “The kind of old school, traditional professional TV economy has realized that in order to even compete at all with the creators, they have to at least match them shot for shot on their ability to deploy those tools,” he said. AI could enable a shift from media that’s meant to be watched or read to digital content that viewers can interact with, according to Oren Etzioni, former CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence and professor emeritus at the University of Washington. “What if you could actually talk to Melania Trump about the chapter?” he told CNN. “That’s coming soon, maybe not with her, but you know, coming soon to a book near you.” The launch of Trump’s audiobook also comes as AI-generated content has raised questions about whether AI will take humans’ jobs as it gets better at tasks like creating podcasts, authoring books and writing code. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs report, released earlier this year, 41% of employers plan to downsize as generative AI plays a bigger role in work-related tasks. Aneesh Raman, the chief economic opportunity officer at LinkedIn, recently fretted about AI replacing some entry-level jobs in a op-ed. Those fears have been especially prevalent in the media industry; film and TV writers in the Writers Guild of America went on strike in 2023 in part to prevent aspects of their . An agreement was reached AI can’t be used to “write or rewrite literary material.” The WGA did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. But answering the question of whether AI will replace media jobs is complicated; experts see some areas, like voiceover work, that could be impacted quickly. Yet other roles that involve nuanced handling of sensitive data will be more challenging to fill with AI. “If I’m an investigative journalist, and I spend a lot of time getting to know people and understanding complex situations, that’s not a job that’s easy to replace,” said Shirky. It’s also possible that the answer will fall somewhere in between; companies may shift their hiring practices to include professionals with AI expertise. But that might not mean job cuts. “Traditionally, a development department would be kind of three people with arts degrees,” said Connock. “And now it might be one person with an arts degree, one person who’s a kind of professional coder, and one person who’s kind of an academic researcher.”",

    "content": "After a slow start to 2025, the Hollywood box office has pulled off a “Stitchpossible” comeback buoyed by a huge holiday weekend. Disney’s “Lilo & Stitch” and the eighth installment of “Mission: Impossible” helped spark a record $325 million estimated box office haul for Memorial Day weekend. “Lilo & Stitch” grossed roughly $145.5 million domestically Friday through Sunday and is expected to earn another $37.5 million by late Monday after expectations of at least $160 million for the three-day weekend. It is expected to be the highest-grossing opening for the holiday weekend, likely edging the 2022 release of Paramount’s “Top Gun Maverick” ($160 million), according to Comscore data. “Lilo & Stitch,” a live-action remake of the 2002 animated film, surged ahead of Paramount and Skydance’s “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning,” which grossed about $63 million in domestic sales through Sunday, surpassing projections of about $60 million for the three-day weekend. The latest Tom Cruise blockbuster is expected to earn about $77 million through the holiday and is the best three-day opening for the franchise, topping 2018’s “Mission: Impossible — Fallout,” which earned $61 million. “That perfect combination of ‘Lilo and Stitch’ and ‘Mission: Impossible’ put a spotlight on Memorial Day weekend,” Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore, told CNN on Sunday. “We were singing a very sad song a year ago.” The strong Memorial Day weekend box office is an encouraging sign for the industry, which had grossed a tepid $132 million for the weekend last year. Many Americans have returned to movie theaters since April with the releases of “A Minecraft Movie” and “Sinners,” which have combined to gross $677.4 million. Both movies are distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. Warner Bros. Discovery is the parent company of CNN. “You really couldn’t formulate or write a better script for the movie industry to see this kind of a turnaround on what’s usually been a pretty important bellwether for the summer box office,” said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder and owner of Box Office Theory. “Lilo & Stitch” is also the third highest-grossing opening weekend for Disney’s live actions, which have not always met expectations. In late March, the release of “Snow White” fell well short of industry projections, due in part to some well-publicized . But “Lilo & Stitch” is more in line with the 2017 release of “Beauty and the Beast,” which opened to $174.75 million, said Daniel Loria, editorial director at Box Office Pro. Loria added that this “Lilo & Stitch” installment will make more than the roughly $145 million that the original managed domestically over its entire theatrical run. “When there’s a property like (‘Lilo & Stitch’) that’s been able to define an audience for two decades after its theatrical release, and hit that same audience that grew up with the movie with a chance to take their own family, their own kids to go see it … we see great returns on that,” said Loria. Dergarabedian said the summer movie box office could exceed $4 billion, which would be in line with 2023. Box office analysts and social media have used the term “Stitchpossible” and other variations to conjure the smashing success of 2023 blockbusters “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” which was dubbed “Barbenheimer.” But Americans aren’t necessarily heading to theaters to take part in a cultural phenomenon. Loria described the success of “Barbenheimer” as “organic” and “a viral phenomenon” that doesn’t necessarily need to be replicated every time two major movies open on the same weekend. “It didn’t used to be weird when you had two big movies come out on the same weekend. That wasn’t an anomaly,” he said. Robbins doesn’t think there will ever be another “Barbenheimer.” But he called efforts by moviegoers to create such names for double-movie releases “a great part of the narrative.” Michael O’Leary, the president and CEO of Cinema United, said he’s less concerned about the catchy title created when two major movies open on the same day and more excited about how moviegoers respond. “They know that there’s something special going on in the movie theater, and they want to be a part of it,” O’Leary said. He added that watching a film in theaters is “a shared experience that you can’t replicate anywhere else.” “To be looking at the movie theater as the most relevant entertainment option this weekend is huge,” said Dergarabedian.",

    "content": "Gas prices are holding steady for the nearly 40 million Americans expected to hit the road on Memorial Day. The average cost of a gallon of regular unleaded in the United States on Sunday was $3.18, the lowest over a Memorial Day weekend since 2021, when the average was $3.04. Gas prices are sharply lower compared with this time last year, when the national average was roughly $3.59, and far lower than 2022, when the average was $4.60. More Americans are expected to be on the road over Memorial Day weekend. AAA estimates about 39.4 million Americans will be driving, an increase of 1 million, or about 3%, from 2024, and a 4.6% increase from 2019. Low gas prices have been a bright spot for the US economy amid an overall gloomy outlook due to President Donald Trump’s and a decline in . AAA the cost of gas hasn’t seen its usual seasonal spikes. “Demand is expected to rise, and pump prices may creep up along with it. Gas prices typically peak in the summer and start coming down when schools go back in session in the fall,” AAA on May 12. Average gas prices have hovered around their current levels since the start of 2025. Gas prices for the holiday are also near historic lows. In 2003, gas was priced at $1.50 a gallon leading into the holiday, which, adjusted for inflation, is roughly $2.65. The holiday gas prices haven’t been below $2 since 2020 — during the Covid-19 pandemic — when the Memorial Day average was at $1.87, according to AAA. “We expect (gas prices) to continue to decline because of the president’s energy policies,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday at a news conference. Trump has focused intensely on lowering energy prices by promising to unleash domestic production, slash red tape and push OPEC to add supply. US oil prices have plunged about 20% since Trump’s second term began in January. Analysts say that drop has been driven in part by Saudi Arabia and OPEC’s sharp production increases — moves that Trump publicly called for days after taking office during a in Davos, Switzerland. “A lot of the reason crude prices have fallen is pessimism about the economy and Saudi Arabia and OPEC producing more,” Bob McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group, . Oil prices crashed to four-year lows in early April when Trump’s sky-high tariffs sent recession fears skyrocketing. Crude rebounded after Trump paused many of those tariffs. Also behind lower oil prices: Trump’s decision not to follow through on former President Joe Biden’s final-hours move on January 10 to with harsh sanctions.

    "content": "Memorial Day marks the unofficial start to summer, but this year, it may also kick off a season of higher prices. Small businesses that sell beer, fireworks and other summer staples told CNN they are grappling with higher costs amid new tariffs that the Trump administration placed on nearly all imports to the United States last month. Here’s what you should know. While many economists expect prices to rise from President Donald Trump’s tariffs, it’s certainly true that not all items are seeing price increases — yet. In fact, US inflation in April in more than four years. That means some summer products may still be spared from an inflationary squeeze as tariffs work their way through the economy, said Ernie Tedeschi, the former chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers during the Biden administration and the director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale University, which has been tracking the tariff impact on consumers. But if you’re planning a cookout, tariff-induced price increases could hit your grocery bill sooner than other price hikes. “Perishable goods like food are the imports that turn over more quickly,” Tedeschi said. “So the price that you see at any given time is more likely to reflect tariffs.” The cost of buying a new barbecue to grill that food might still be stable, though, he said. “Where there’s more of a delay on tariffs are things like durable goods, like a barbecue or grill,” Tedeschi said. “The reason is that retailers like Home Depot and Best Buy generally still have a large pre-tariff inventory. They will likely sell through that first before they start selling the tariffed goods that cost more.” Another key ingredient to most barbecues also hasn’t been spared by tariffs: beer. In April, President Donald Trump placed a , including empty aluminum cans and imported canned beer. About 38.5%, or 16.1 million barrels of imported beer, came in cans in 2024, according to the Brewers Association, a trade association for brewers. Even local, US-based brewers are . Sheila Malone, a manager at Long Ireland Beer Company in Riverhead, New York, told CNN that rising expenses have left the future of her business uncertain. Malone said she’s seen the cost of everything from hops to plastic cups rise over the last few years. Now, she estimates the cost of the aluminum cans her company purchases has risen between 10% and 15% this year. “Every day we open up our social media and we see another brewery that we follow saying they are closing their doors, and that’s a really scary reality for us,” Malone said. Long Ireland Beer Company recently raised its prices for the first time in years to keep up, said Malone, who added that the company is searching for lower-cost aluminum suppliers and seeking new ways to grow profits to stay afloat. Memorial Day weekend also kicks off the busy season for fireworks businesses. Douglas Burda, the CEO of Red Apple Fireworks, said the majority of fireworks are imported from China, which has been producing fireworks for hundreds of years. There are very few businesses that manufacture fireworks in the United States, Burda noted. On April 10, tariffs on nearly all Chinese imports, including fireworks, climbed as high as 145% as a tit-for-tat trade conflict between China and the United States escalated. About a month later, the Trump administration announced it would temporarily to 30%. Burda said he hasn’t had to raise prices yet, since his company has stockpiled enough fireworks to last through the summer in its large warehouse and retail spaces. However, Americans who buy fireworks at roadside stands will likely face higher prices this summer due to tariffs, Burda said. “Consumers by and large buy fireworks at the last minute on the side of the road. You’re always going to see higher prices when you do that,” Burda said. “But now, for certain, those already-high prices are going to be even higher.” However, there may be one place to find savings if you are one of the nearly 40 million Americans traveling by car this Memorial Day. The national average price of a gallon of gasoline is expected to be $3.08 on Memorial Day, released Tuesday by fuel savings platform GasBuddy. That is the lowest gas price for Memorial Day weekend since 2021. For many Americans, Memorial Day is about more than pool parties and picnics. It is a day dedicated to honoring and remembering the people who died while serving in the US military. Americans who may be looking to purchase an American flag this holiday weekend will have a harder time finding cheaper flags produced overseas this year, said Reggie VandenBosch, who works at Valley Forge Flag Company, one of the largest American flag manufacturers. That’s because earlier this month, a major shipping loophole, known as the de minimis exemption, which allowed shipments of goods worth $800 or less to come into the United States duty-free, expired. Now those lower-cost shipments are taxed between 30% and 54%. Before the loophole was closed, e-commerce sites like Amazon had been flooded with cheaper flags claiming to be American-made. “Many Americans don’t think of an American flag as being an American flag if it’s made offshore,” VandenBosch said. “Now that the de minimis loophole was eliminated, we’re already starting to see sales return on those platforms back to the domestic players.”",

    "content": "Being an honest public servant will always be a rewarding choice, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Sunday in a speech at a pre-graduation ceremony at Princeton University amid months of unrelenting personal attacks from President Donald Trump. “As you navigate the world of bright possibilities that awaits you, I urge you to take on the challenge and the opportunity to serve your fellow citizens,” Powell said. “Fifty years from now, you will want to be able to look in the mirror and know that you did what you thought was right, in every part of your life.” “At the end of the day, your integrity is all you have. Guard it carefully,” he said. Powell also described America’s universities as the “envy of the world and a crucial national asset,” designations he urged the class to not take for granted. He then delivered a stark warning about the threats facing universities and democracy at a time when Trump is increasingly wielding the power of the federal government to make institutions of higher education . “When you look back in 50 years, you will want to know that you have done whatever it takes to preserve and strengthen our democracy, and bring us ever closer to the Founders’ timeless ideals,” he said. Since taking the helm in 2018, Powell has steered the Fed through a litany of challenges, such as an economic crisis sowed by the Covid-19 pandemic, a historic bout of high inflation, and now, that has unsettled decision-makers across the world. Powell has also dealt with direct and personal attacks on his character — a rarity for someone in charge of America’s central bank. Trump has assailed Powell for not lowering interest rates quickly enough, accusing him of playing politics and describing him as a “fool” and “a major loser,” while also saying that his termination “cannot come fast enough.” Top administration officials have privately warned Trump of financial-market chaos if he were to proceed with sacking Powell, Powell, for his part, has remained mum amid the criticism. In November, when asked if he’d step down if Trump asked him to, Powell said that’s “not permitted under the law.” In recent weeks, Fed officials have said they will keep rates on hold, mostly because of lingering uncertainty over Trump’s tariff policies. Trump, meanwhile, hasn’t provided evidence to back up his claims that Fed officials are not cutting rates as a way to help Democrats. In the latest salvo of the one-sided Trump-Powell clash, the president took to his social media platform again to call on Powell to lower borrowing costs. “Too Late Powell, a man legendary for being Too Late, will probably blow it again - But who knows???” Trump wrote on May 17. Earlier this month, the Fed kept its benchmark lending rate unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, extending a holding pattern that began in January. Central bank officials have maintained that it’s best to wait to see how the US economy responds to Trump’s ever-evolving trade war before lowering rates. “Everything’s always on the table. But I feel like the bar for me is a little higher for action in any direction while we’re waiting to get some clarity,” Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC in a May 23 interview.",

    "content": "By week’s end, it’ll be much clearer how the US economy is holding up amid President Donald Trump’s sweeping policy changes. Trump’s erratic trade war has already and — mostly due to American businesses rushing to stock up on imports. And his “big, beautiful” tax bill currently moving through Congress, which is expected to dramatically widen the country’s deficit, has roiled the bond market. But what matters for the underlying health of the broader economy is whether demand — for goods, services and homes — continues to chug along or fall off a cliff in the face of persistently elevated uncertainty, rising borrowing costs and higher prices. New data due this week should give Wall Street and the Federal Reserve a better sense of the unfolding fallout of Trump’s policies, including two new consumer surveys, a revised estimate of economic growth in the first quarter and fresh figures on consumer spending. Market observers will also get some clues on what it all means for the Fed, with several officials slated to give public remarks throughout the week. Last week, Trump reignited trade tensions by threatening and like Samsung. (He delayed the EU tariffs on Sunday.) The US House of Representatives also , sending it to the Senate, which is expected to make some changes. Fresh figures this week will show how Americans have been feeling recently, known as soft data, and how consumers and businesses have been spending, referred to as hard data. On Tuesday, the Conference Board releases its consumer survey for May, a closely watched measure of people’s attitudes toward the economy. In April, consumer confidence , the business group said, the lowest level since May 2020. Economists polled by data firm FactSet project consumer confidence to have improved slightly this month. Then later on Friday, the University of Michigan releases a revised version of its consumer survey for May. A preliminary reading released earlier this month showed that consumer sentiment sank in May to the second-lowest level on records going back to 1952. On Thursday, the Commerce Department releases its second estimate of gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic output, for the first quarter. An initial estimate showed that GDP declined at an annualized rate of 0.3% in the first three months of the year, the worst quarter since 2022, driven by a higher trade deficit as Americans rushed to beat Trump’s tariffs. On Friday, the department also releases April data on household spending, income and the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. In March, consumer spending soared 0.7% as Americans pulled forward their purchases, particularly of cars, to avoid the sticker shock from Trump’s tariffs. Persistently elevated mortgage rates, concerns over the economy, volatility in financial markets and home prices that continue to climb are clouding the outlook for America’s housing market. That’s led to an New data this week will show if buyers will get squeezed even more. On Tuesday, S&P Global releases its S&P Global CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index for March. Home-price growth in February continued to climb, rising at an annual pace of 3.9%, as lingering housing shortages continued to push up prices. On Thursday, the National Association of Realtors reports home sales based on contract signings in April. Pending home sales surged 6.1% in March from the prior month, the strongest monthly gain since December 2023, which NAR’s chief economist, Lawrence Yun, said was “fueled by ongoing job growth.” That same day, Freddie Mac reports on the average rate of a standard, 30-year fixed mortgage in the week ending May 29. Mortgage rates last week averaged 6.86%, the highest level since mid-February, as bond investors Demand for bonds dropped last week, which cratered prices and sent yields rising. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note, which largely influences mortgage rates, went above 4.61% last week, as the 30-year eclipsed 5.14%, its highest level since October 2023. Market observers regularly pore over Fed officials’ latest public comments and minutes from their latest policy meeting because they give a clue on what to expect for interest rates in the coming months. So far, Fed officials have signaled in their recent speeches that they prefer to stand pat as they wait for further clarity on Trump’s policies and how the US economy is responding to the administration’s massive changes. The job market’s resilience has also allowed the Fed to stay on hold, since it means the central bank doesn’t need to provide any urgent relief through a rate cut.

    "content": "President Donald Trump said Sunday that he has agreed to delay a 50% tariff on European Union imports until July 9, the latest instance of Trump declaring an impending tariff and throwing markets into confusion only to later walk back the threatened levies. Trump said he and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had a “very nice call” that led to the delay. “(Von der Leyen) said she wants to get down to serious negotiation,” Trump told reporters at Morristown Municipal Airport in New Jersey. “July 9 would be the day, that was the date she requested. Could we move it from June 1 to July 9? I agreed to do that.” “She said we will rapidly get together and see if we can work something out,” he added. As recently as Friday, Trump said he was with the EU, and that their tariff rate was set at 50% and would go into effect on June 1. That rate would have come after he had imposed a 20% reciprocal tariff on the EU in April — , as were other so-called reciprocal tariffs. Minutes after speaking with reporters, Trump posted on Truth Social that “talks will begin rapidly.” Earlier in the day, von der Leyen had posted on X that there was a “good call” with Trump. “The EU and US share the world’s most consequential and close trade relationship,” von der Leyen posted. “Europe is ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively. To reach a good deal, we would need the time until July 9.” On Monday, an EU spokeperson said there was a new momentum behind trade talks. “With this call, there is now also a new impetus for the negotiations… from our side, we always said we were ready to make a deal,” Paula Pinho, chief spokesperson for the European Commission, told reporters on Monday. Following news of the delay, stock markets in Asia posted modest gains on Monday. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 rose as much as 0.8% in early trading, while South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.9%. China’s Shanghai Composite Index edged up 0.3%. Taiwan’s TAIEX and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 traded relatively flat, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slipped 0.3%. Trump has taken a particular issue with “non-monetary trade barriers,” as he has repeatedly called them, as well as countries or trading blocs that run trade deficits with the United States. Those occur when the US purchases more from another trading partner than that country purchases from the US. Last year, the United States ran a $236 billion trade deficit with the EU, according to US Commerce Department data. Trump also said Sunday that he “tended to agree” with recent comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on not needing to return textile manufacturing to the United States. “We’re not looking to make sneakers and t-shirts … we want to make military equipment,” Trump said. “We want to make big things. We want to do the ‘AI thing’ with the computers.” This story has been updated with additional content",

It marks the fourth consecutive month of declining annual sales for Tesla in Europe and comes as the automaker faces trouble on two big fronts: backlash from consumers over CEO Elon Musk’s politics and intensifying competition from Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers. As in the United States, Musk’s behavior in recent months has provoked repercussions and protests from people in Europe. The billionaire has backed some candidates in Germany and the UK, and played a prominent role in US President Donald Trump’s second administration, spearheading efforts to lay off thousands of . April also marked the first time that Chinese rival BYD overtook Tesla to sell more vehicles in Europe, according to from Jato Dynamics, a research firm. The difference was slight — BYD sold 66 more battery EVs (BEVs) than Tesla that month — but the “implications are enormous,” Felipe Munoz, global analyst at JATO Dynamics, said in a statement last week. “This is a watershed moment for Europe’s car market, particularly when you consider that Tesla has led the European BEV market for years, while BYD only officially began operations beyond Norway and the Netherlands in late 2022,” Munoz said. Tesla’s falling sales have arrived even as the bloc’s wider EV market has expanded. In the first four months of the year, sales of new BEVs rose by more than 26%, according to the ACEA. Tesla sells only BEVs, unlike many rival carmakers, including BYD, which sell a mix of battery-powered and hybrid EVs. Tesla doesn’t report monthly sales and doesn’t break out sales by market. It did not respond to a request for comment on its sales last month. Tuesday’s data comes on the heels of Tesla reporting its for 2024, and the in history during the first quarter. That resulted in in the quarter. Chris Isidore and Robert North contributed reporting.",

    "content": "Tinned fish in America no longer means a sad, forgotten can of tuna collecting dust in the pantry. And Americans looking to save money in the face of economic headwinds are fueling their soaring popularity. are proudly posting a mosaic of gourmet ocean-dwellers plucked from waters off the coasts of countries like Spain and Italy, with vibrant packaging that evokes a Mediterranean seaside vacation. Try a lemon caper mackerel over poached egg and toast, or chop up spicy sardines over bruschetta and balsamic, they encourage. Even , long a mainstream cultural bellwether, makes a surprisingly flavorful canned calamari. Social butterflies are hosting , while those who want a in are creating “seacuterie” boards – like charcuterie boards but with tinned fish – or whipping up gourmet pastas with a $4.99 can of sardines. Tinned fish, unlike toilet paper and is one of those pandemic purchases that has had relative staying power in the American psyche. But chatter about tinned fish has particularly spiked in recent months, at the same time as and amid the Trump administration’s chaotic trade war. Though most mainstream economists believe the United States isn’t in a recession right now, , according to University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index this month. It’s a sign that tinned fish could be a grim “ ,” some social media commentators – and experts – lament. Searches for “tinned fish” on Google spiked to the highest 2023 levels around the holiday season in 2024 and maintained an uptick since then. In the past 90 days, searches for Nuri’s Portuguese sardines in spiced olive oil skyrocketed 2,750% and Brunswick sardines in olive oil jumped 4,000%. When you want to feel fancy, tinned fish is a “happy medium between a can of Bumble (tuna) and going to the fresh case in the grocery,” Chris Sherman, CEO of New England-based Island Creek Oysters, told CNN. Consumers are looking for “affordable escapism,” Ross Steinman, a consumer psychologist and professor at Widener University, told CNN. Americans this summer. So instead of booking that trip to Mallorca, they’re sampling tinned fish imported from Spain in colorful Mediterranean-blue packaging. Whether it’s a straight recession indicator is complicated, Amelia Finaret, a food economist at Allegheny College and registered dietician, said to CNN. If only cheap cans of tuna were increasing in popularity, that would be an alarming sign. The growth of both affordable and artisanal cans of sardines and mussels could just show Americans are diversifying their preferences for healthy sources of proteins. However, she said when people are stressed out about the economy, they turn to two types of foods at the grocery stores: ones with a long shelf life and ones that are convenient, both qualities that tinned fish possess. “If convenience is really what people are looking for, then maybe this is an indicator of strain, versus being able to spend time in the kitchen with fresh fish,” she said. And there’s no escaping sardines, even if the salty snacks aren’t your thing: predict it’s going to be a Sardine Girl Summer. Anthropologie storefronts in Manhattan last month were adorned with human-sized decorations that looked like fish tins, and the retailer recently dropped a new that features sardines on glassware, towels and even candles - the $26 Original Tinned Fish Candle comes in a “tin,” with scents like olive oil and sea salt. Fashion retailer Staud’s beaded “ ” bag was on many a whimsical fashionista’s wish list. The trend is similar to a luxury brand, Widener University’s Steinman said. But while luxury brands symbolize wealth, donning a sardine tote shows “you’re on the pulse and are aware of what’s going on.” Island Creek Oysters began selling online in 2019, and it has “continued on an upward trend ever since,” Sherman said. Tinned fish was a way to bring restaurant-level food to your kitchen, he said, and the years-long shelf life also evoked the that overtook some during the pandemic. The growing tinned fish industry is still the “wild west,” said Dan Waber, co-owner of Rainbow Tomatoes Garden, a retailer of tinned fish. In niche industries like tinned fish, he notices even a good football game over the weekend or a post by a social media influencer can impact short-term sales. Neah Patkunas, who reviews tinned fish on her Instagram, first got into the canned creatures in 2021 and was known in her circles as the “tinned fish girl.” People thought it “kind of strange that I was eating it as frequently as I did,” she said. For Patkunas, tinned fish is a cheap and easy source of protein, but at the same time, she considers the pricier tins from Europe to be a luxury import. Spain and Portugal are renowned for their tinned fish exports, and Northern Europe has a strong history in canning. Tinned fish industries are also strong in Japan, Korea and China. And that could be making it harder for those who sell tinned fish in the US to plan ahead, since in the US is imported. Tariffs have thrown many businesses that rely on imports into a loop and put a damper on consumer sentiment. With , Waber hasn’t been able to make any major decisions on the imported goods. “All we can do is react,” he said. “When the price goes up, the price we sell for goes up.” At the same time, a wide price range of tinned fish means that consumers can buy a $6 tin of sardines instead of a $10 one, he said. Patkunas, the tinned fish reviewer, said Americans are late to the party, only now viewing tinned fish as a way to try another country’s delicacy. It wasn’t until late 2024 that her friends began viewing tinned fish as a new delicacy, and this year, she finally feels like “it’s something that I don’t feel weird bringing up.” The few canneries based in the United States are enjoying the rise in popularity among Americans. Mathew Scaletta’s grandmother started Wildfish Cannery in 1987 in southeastern Alaska. The business began as a stop for fishermen to have their catches smoked and preserved, open for just the few months of the summer fishing season. Then in the 2010s, Scaletta wondered why there wasn’t a cannery in the US that treated tinned goods like a delicacy with the best quality fish instead of a bare-bones commodity. Ten years ago, he came back to Alaska and took over Wildfish Cannery with that vision, developing product lines and redesigning packaging. Once the first pandemic lockdown happened, “we sold what would’ve been months’ worth of stock in a week.” He predicts that in five years, the US market will view tinned fish as more established, rather than a trend. Five years after the pandemic, he still expressed surprise that the food he grew up eating over rice and hot sauce has become so trendy. But is tinned fish’s resurgence truly a recession indicator? “I’m here selling $10 cans of fish, which is bougie as hell, so I don’t know,” he said.",

    "content": "National Public Radio filed a First Amendment lawsuit against the Trump administration on Tuesday, alleging that President Trump’s attempt to defund NPR is a “clear violation of the Constitution.” Several NPR member stations from Colorado joined the national network in filing the suit, highlighting the local impacts of taxpayer-funded media. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, DC, says Trump’s maneuvers against NPR violate both “the expressed will of Congress and the First Amendment’s bedrock guarantees of freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association.” Moreover, it “threatens the existence of a public radio system that millions of Americans across the country rely on for vital news and information,” the lawsuit states. Trump targeted both NPR and its television counterpart, PBS, . The president accused the public media outfits of bias and said the Corporation for Public Broadcasting must stop funding them. The White House reiterated its claims of bias on Tuesday, saying CPB “is creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers’ dime.” Public media executives say the White House is grossly mischaracterizing what NPR and PBS do. But the allegations of bias are at the heart of the lawsuit; the suit says the defunding order is “textbook retaliation” for the network’s perceived point of view. In the realm of First Amendment law, this is known as viewpoint-based discrimination. Trump’s move against NPR “really is just pure viewpoint discrimination,” Theodore Boutrous, one of the veteran attorneys representing NPR in the suit, told CNN. Boutrous also said that the 1967 law creating public broadcasting was clearly meant to “insulate” the networks from “precisely this type of political coercion.” The corporation, CPB for short, is a private nonprofit corporation that was set up to be free of presidential interference. CPB has filed its own lawsuit against the president’s attempt to fire three of its board members. Each year, the CPB disburses $535 million in taxpayer funds to public radio and TV stations nationwide and to producers of educational and cultural programming. Stations, in turn, provide free and universal access to news, emergency alerts and a wide array of programming. In Trump’s first term, he repeatedly tried to strip all funding from PBS and NPR, but Congress allocated the funds anyway. In Trump’s second term, he is trying new ways to shut down the public broadcasters. In so doing, he is usurping Congress, NPR charges. The Republican-controlled House and Senate allocated funds for public radio and TV as recently as this March — in a bill that Trump signed into law. That very funding is what Trump is now trying to erase and what NPR is trying to preserve. PBS has also been preparing to take legal action but has not yet filed suit. “PBS is considering every option, including taking legal action, to allow our organization to continue to provide essential programming and services to member stations and all Americans,” a spokesperson told CNN.",

    "content": "Chinese e-commerce firm PDD Holdings saw first-quarter net profit fall 47% to 14.74 billion yuan ($2.05 billion) as its domestic platform suffered from intense local competition and its international business was hit by global trade uncertainty. US-listed shares of the company fell more than 17%. “(PDD’s) massive bottom line miss is due to much weaker than expected operating margin, likely impacted by US tariffs,” said Mscience analyst Vinci Zhang. Despite deep price cuts by retailers and government stimulus measures to boost spending, a prolonged property crisis in the world’s second-largest economy has cast a shadow over consumer spending in China, even on PDD’s Pinduoduo, which has out-performed peers with its low-price focus. “Slower domestic consumption, intensified competition, and global trade frictions are weighing on growth,” said US Tiger Securities analyst Bo Pei. “Elevated costs reflect strategic promotional activities and advertising spend to support merchant sales, it’s aimed at supporting the platform’s long-term ecosystem health but sacrifices near-term profitability.” China’s largest online e-commerce platforms - Alibaba, Pinduoduo and JD.com - have been scrambling for a greater share of the domestic market, sparking a long-running price war to entice consumers to open their wallets. Alibaba’s quarterly revenue also , although JD.com notched , buoyed by a government trade-in scheme focused on its strongest categories, including home appliances and electronics. Meanwhile, a tit-for-tat tariff escalation between the United States and China, followed by a temporary 90-day de-escalation, has generated widespread uncertainty for global business Temu. “Radical change in external policy environments such as tariffs has created significant pressure for our merchants,” PDD chairman and co-ceo Chen Lei told analysts in a post-earnings call. The United States earlier this month for goods from China valued at under $800 entering the country under the “de minimis” provision, a trade exemption leveraged by Temu to avoid tariffs and keep prices low. “Our global business is working with merchants across regions to bring stable prices and abundant supply to strengthen our operations in the markets we serve,” Chen said, reiterating Temu’s desire not to raise prices in the face of tariffs and its strategic shift to seeing more orders fulfilled by local merchants. PDD reported revenue of 95.67 billion yuan ($13.30 billion) for the quarter ended March 31, compared with analysts’ average estimate of 102.51 billion yuan, according to data compiled by LSEG.",

    "content": "It’s been a little while since Americans had an inkling of optimism about the economy. Consumer confidence rose 12.3 points this month to a reading of 98, the Conference Board said in its latest survey released Tuesday, the first monthly gain since November and the biggest monthly increase since March 2021. That’s higher than economists’ expectations for a reading of 88, according to data firm FactSet. For the past several months, President Donald Trump’s sweeping policy changes, including his ongoing trade war, have taken a toll on people’s attitudes toward the economy. Last month, consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since the early days of the Covid pandemic. But progress in Trump’s negotiations with other countries over trade gave Americans a sense of hope this month. “The rebound was already visible before the May 12 US-China trade deal but gained momentum afterwards,” Stephanie Guichard, senior economist at the Conference Board, said in a release. “The monthly improvement was largely driven by consumer expectations as all three components of the Expectations Index — business conditions, employment prospects, and future income — rose from their April lows.” Still, economic jitters persist and Trump still has more than a hundred trade deals to hash out by early July, when his reciprocal tariffs are slated to go back into effect, if countries haven’t negotiated a trade deal with the US. So, uncertainty is still very much elevated, which raises the question of what it means for consumer spending, which powers two-thirds of the US economy. “Consumer confidence may have soared, and Americans have reason to be happy given the rollback in tariffs, especially with China,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in commentary issued Tuesday. “But when prices start rising from existing tariffs in a month or two, it will be a sobering reminder that a new inflation fight has just begun.” Trump’s trade war is still in flux, but some countries have signaled they’re willing to cooperate and potentially strike a full trade deal. The first country was the United Kingdom on May 8, which didn’t announce an actual trade deal, but rather a concept of a framework, with some details that were agreed upon, such as car imports from the UK being taxed at a reduced rate. Then on May 12 in Geneva, China and the United States agreed to drastically roll back tariffs on each other’s goods for an initial 90-day period, in a surprise breakthrough between two countries that were engaged in a worsening tit-for-tat trade war. But any potential US-China trade deal still has a rocky path ahead. Last week, China’s Commerce Ministry said the US was “undermining” the Geneva talks after the Trump administration warned companies against using made by national tech champion Huawei. Beijing has also that China work to prevent the flow of fentanyl into the US, saying that it’s the “US’s problem, not China’s.” The European Union on Sunday said it’s willing to fast-track trade talks with the US, prompting Trump to delay the 50% tariff on EU imports he threatened last week until July 9. Trump said he and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had a “very nice call” that led to the pause. “(Von der Leyen) said she wants to get down to serious negotiation,” Trump told reporters at Morristown Municipal Airport in New Jersey. “July 9 would be the day, that was the date she requested. Could we move it from June 1 to July 9? I agreed to do that.” Consumer confidence may potentially be starting to recover, but Trump’s trade war is far from over. That leaves Wall Street and the Federal Reserve to keep a close eye on whether consumer demand remains in positive territory or fall off a cliff in the face of lingering uncertainty. It’s been somewhat difficult to assess the true health of consumer spending lately. Over the past few months, Americans have pulled forward purchases, particularly of cars, to beat Trump’s tariffs. That has skewed crucial economic data, such as retail sales. Will consumers continue to spend after these brief buying sprints? A key gauge of underlying demand in the economy — referred to as final sales to private domestic purchasers — accelerated to 3% in the first quarter from 2.9% in the fourth quarter. All eyes will be on that figure for the second quarter, when it is reported in July. This Friday, the Commerce Department is set to release April data on household spending, income and the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. That should give market observers a better sense as to whether consumers are pulling back — or continuing to open their wallets.",

    "content": "Rinse, repeat. Stocks rose Tuesday after President Donald Trump did a 180-degree turn on his threat to place a massive 50% tariff on goods imported from the European Union. The Dow was up 640 points, or 1.54%. The broader S&P 500 rose 1.7% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 2.1%. Investors cheered in their first day of trading since until July 9. He had initially said they’d go into effect next week. US markets were closed for Memorial Day on Monday, so Tuesday is the first chance for Wall Street to react since the on-again, off-again tariffs went off, again. If this feels familiar, that’s because this narrative continues to play out over and over again during the Trump administration. The president continues to threaten tariffs, markets react — sometimes severely — and the president often walks back his pledge, giving markets a sigh of relief. That’s why, after nearly plunging into a bear market in April, markets have largely rallied since Trump paused his “Liberation Day” tariffs and announced trade talks — and even a couple of deal frameworks with the United Kingdom and China. But several mini-threats and pauses since then have sent markets on a roller coaster. Stocks extended their gains on Tuesday after new survey from the Conference Board showed consumer confidence in May was better than expected, improving after five months of decline. Also helping stocks Tuesday: a breather for the beleaguered bond market. Yields, which trade in opposite direction to prices, fell Tuesday on some relief from Trump’s pause on his suddenly reignited trade war. The 30-year yield fell below 5%, and the 10-year yield fell below 4.5% — both psychological levels that for a couple weeks, particularly after Trump and Republicans’ “Big Beautiful Bill” threatened to increase America’s debt by nearly $4 trillion over the next decade. US bonds also bounced back after Japan’s bonds rallied on some signs from the country’s finance ministry that it may invest more in foreign bond markets a day after it reported as the world’s largest debt financer — a title Japan had held for 34 years. The dollar, which had also been squeezed in recent weeks on debt and trade war concerns, rallied a little on Tuesday. But market analysts were cautious about the staying power of Tuesday’s relief rally, given Trump’s ability to change the narrative on a dime. They also continue to worry about the trade war and America’s unsustainable debt situation. “We view the current period as still the ‘calm before the storm,’ and we expect growth in the second half of the year to weaken,” said Nathan Sheets, global chief economist at Citigroup, in a note to investors Tuesday. “We remain concerned about potential downside risks.” Market veteran Ed Yardeni this weekend warned clients to “buckle up, again” after Trump’s Friday tariff threat. “Stock investing is likely to continue to feel like riding a mechanical bull in a rowdy sports bar. Keep focused on not falling off the bull!” Yardeni wrote in a note. Yardeni said he remains  bullish on US stocks but cautioned that Trump “needs to declare victory” in his trade war before the end of the summer to “avoid a recession later this year.” CNN’s Matt Egan and John Towfighi contributed to this report.",

    "content": "If you feel like your teen is a mystery, new data may help give you a better look inside their world. While teen boys and girls are facing many of the same issues, including school pressure and mental health concerns, they may need different kinds of support, according to a published Thursday. “One of our main objectives with the research was trying to understand the challenges that teens are facing these days, and specifically how they’re experiencing school, and whether these things differ by gender,” said Kim Parker, Pew’s director of social trends research. “We’ve been doing a lot of work this year on men and masculinity, and part of that conversation involves what’s happening with boys and girls.” The survey was conducted September 18 through October 10 among 1,391 teens ages 13 to 17. While the data did show differences among them ­­–– such as girls reporting more of a pressure to fit in socially and look good while boys said they felt they should be strong and good at sports more often –– many of their perspectives were similar. Both girls and boys said it was highly important to find a career they enjoy, making money and cultivating friendships in the future, according to the data. “We are prone to negatively stereotyping teenagers as superficial in their interests, and these results are an excellent reminder that teenagers are serious about the schoolwork they’re doing now, and they are looking ahead to their careers,” said psychologist Dr. Lisa Damour, author of “ .” She was not involved in the report. Teen boys and girls alike reported they felt pressure to get good grades, according to the data. And for those who didn’t see it as an even split, both teen girls and boys perceived girls as getting better grades and being favored by teachers, the report showed. What they perceive matches existing data that shows girls on average do tend to get better grades than boys, Damour said. But grades aren’t a zero-sum game –– the success of girls in school doesn’t have to mean boys do worse, said Dr. Annie Maheux, assistant professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Winston Family Distinguished Fellow at the Winston National Center on Technology Use, Brain and Psychological Development. The disparity might be a sign that something in schooling isn’t working for boys as well as it should, noted Maheux, who wasn’t involved in the survey. “Schools are set up in such a way that kids who sit still and are less impulsive are going to do well, and we know that there’s a big difference in brain development in early adolescence, and that the part of the brain that’s used for impulse control and critical thinking develops later in boys than girls,” said Michelle Icard, a parenting educator and speaker. “We are teaching to half of the audience and need to broaden the way we approach education,” said Icard, who wasn’t involved in the report. More activity and teaching styles that incorporate hands-on learning, for example, might help teen boys do better academically, said Icard, author of “ .” There is good and bad news when it comes to what teens said about their friendships. Only 2% of teens said that they didn’t have any friends, according to the Pew report. And while that number of those without friends would ideally be zero, it is lower than expected and feels positive, Icard said. Friendships are especially important in adolescent years, she added. “Teens are at an age where they’re less likely to turn to an adult for support. They’re naturally going to reach out to their peers before looking to an adult, and peers can be great ushers to adults as needed,” Icard said. “But if you don’t have someone who says, ‘Hey, this is a problem you should talk to a grown-up about,’ then that can be dangerous.” Although most boys reported they had a close friend they could turn to for support, the number was lower (85%) compared with that of girls (95%) who said they could turn to a friend for support, the data showed. “We need to try to lose the mythology that boys don’t make close relationships,” Damour said. But at the same time, “we need to take very seriously that we continue to socialize boys to feel that vulnerable emotions are unacceptable. And so long as we’re doing that, we’re going to have boys and adult men who don’t enjoy the strong social support they deserve.” There was a difference in how teen boys and girls perceived their struggles: Both said that girls were more likely to experience anxiety and depression and boys were more likely to struggle with substance abuse, fighting and class disruptions, according to the data. But those findings don’t mean that one group is experiencing mental health concerns and the other is just facing a behavioral issue, Damour said. “Under mental health, we should fold in the finding that boys are more likely to engage in physical fights,” she said. “One of our well-established understandings as clinicians is that when girls are in distress, they have been socialized to collapse in on themselves –– they’re more likely to experience anxiety and depression. When boys are in distress, they are more likely to act out and get themselves in trouble.” While disciplinary action might be appropriate when a teen is abusing substances or acting out, it is important that such punishment is paired with an understanding that the behavior comes from suffering, which needs to be addressed, too, Damour said. “When we see anger in a teenage boy, we think, ‘Well, that’s not depression,’ but it might be. Or if you see a boy who’s acting recklessly, you might think, ‘Oh, he’s a daredevil,’” Icard added. “That behavior is a reflection of feeling untethered to other people. So, I wouldn’t presume that boys feel less anxious and less depressed.”",

    "content": ". When Nicole started having nearly a decade ago, she was determined to find a solution. After consulting with multiple specialists, she was diagnosed with labial hypoplasia, a condition in which her outer labia were only partially formed. Following surgery to correct the issue, she found significant relief and remained relatively pain-free, into her routine to further support her healing. But the pain returned six years later, this time during the initial stages of penetration. The 33-year-old California resident has been fighting for three years to receive a formal diagnosis, as the root of her discomfort remains unclear. She requested only her first name be used out of privacy concerns. “I get a lot of ‘it’s probably anxiety or related to mental health,’” she said. “It’s disappointing since I made a ton of progress and now feel like I’m being tossed aside.” Nicole’s experience of painful sex isn’t unique. Nearly will experience painful intercourse at some point in their lives, whether it’s a temporary or long-term problem, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. “Sex should never be painful,” said Eva Dillon, a sex therapist based in New York City. “It’s something that women should never have to endure.” Painful intercourse can be caused by several common issues. Women who experience pelvic pain or pain with sexual activity, gynecological exams or tampon use may have tight pelvic floor muscles. The condition can increase tension and cause pain, according to Dr. Anna Falter, a physical therapist specializing in pelvic floor therapy at the Cleveland Clinic, via email. Pelvic pain can also be linked to of the body, including the neck, lower back and hips — issues that might not immediately seem connected to sexual discomfort. Stress, previous surgeries, traumatic experiences or even unconscious muscle tensing can also contribute to this pain. Additionally, hormonal changes, such as decreased estrogen levels or postpartum, especially while breastfeeding, can lead to vaginal dryness, which can make intercourse uncomfortable or painful. For women experiencing pelvic floor muscle tension, pelvic floor physical therapy is often an effective treatment option to reduce pain and prevent muscles from becoming overly tight in the future, Falter said. One commonly used technique in pelvic floor physical therapy is trigger point therapy, which involves applying pressure to tight muscles to help them relax. A pelvic floor physical therapist may perform this method vaginally, using a gloved and lubricated finger to target and massage specific tight areas or trigger points, Falter said. Patients can also learn to perform self-trigger point release at home using their own fingers, a partner, a pelvic wand or vaginal dilators to help relax the internal muscles. Falter also noted that partners are welcome to attend pelvic floor therapy sessions, where they can learn strategies to support their partner if both parties are comfortable. Another approach is pelvic floor lengthening exercises, which differ from the more commonly known Kegel exercises, Falter explained. Lengthening involves relaxing the pelvic floor muscles, often paired with diaphragmatic breathing, where the patient inhales deeply, allowing their abdomen, rib cage and pelvic floor to relax. This movement is more challenging, so Falter recommends seeking help from a pelvic floor physical therapist to ensure you’re using the proper form. Falter also advises women to check in with their bodies throughout the day, especially during activities such as brushing their teeth or sitting on the couch, to check that they aren’t unconsciously tensing their pelvic muscles. Certain yoga poses and stretches, such as , and can help release pelvic tension. Still, it’s good to remember that seeking individualized treatment is always the best approach, Falter said. If your partner is experiencing pain during sex, there are steps you can take to provide comfort and support. Most importantly, if there’s any pain during intercourse, it’s crucial to stop immediately. Continuing despite discomfort can create negative associations between sex and pain, making future encounters even more challenging. “At the end of any sexual encounter, you want to be able to look forward to the next time with anticipation and delight,” Dillon said. “And, if sex is painful, you can begin to dread the next time, and it sets up a cycle, which you don’t want.” Communication is also key, and it’s important for both partners to be open and understanding about the pain and treatment journey, especially if shame or feelings of inadequacy arise. “It can be helpful if the partner takes time to learn about what their partner is experiencing, as well as the treatment strategies they are working on, so they can support and encourage them through the treatment journey,” Falter said. For couples who are temporarily unable to engage in intercourse, there are still many ways to stay connected physically. Dillon recommends trying — non-penetrative sexual activities like manual stimulation or oral sex — to maintain intimacy and pleasure. If intercourse or other forms of sexual activity are off the table, simple gestures such as a meaningful kiss or affectionate hugs can strengthen the emotional bond between partners. “These (forms of touch) are really important for us,” Dillon said. “They tell our nervous systems we’re safe and not alone.” Despite the lack of a clear diagnosis, Nicole has not given up on her desire for a fulfilling intimate relationship. Alongside her partner, she has taken matters into her own hands, exploring alternative solutions. “I tend to feel really frustrated with my body and the pain since I don’t want to have these issues,” Nicole said via email. “Physical intimacy can be such a huge part of a relationship, and sometimes I feel like I’m missing out.” Nicole and her boyfriend have found creative ways to maintain intimacy without intercourse or penetration. They have also incorporated into their routine, which have helped alleviate some of the pain during their intimate moments. But that doesn’t mean she lives without disappointment. “There was a lot of education that had to be done, which can be not so fun and sexy when things are new,” she said.  “In the end it has really brought us closer together and created a more emotional intimate connection pretty early on since we had to have these less fun and pretty technical conversations.”",

    "content": "For many middle-aged and older people, getting a driver’s license was their first taste of long-awaited freedom –– and one they seized as soon as they could. But many of today’s teens are putting off this rite of passage, data shows. Nearly 40% of teens delayed getting their license by one to two years, and 30% delayed by more than two years, according to , professor and executive vice chair of the department of emergency medicine at the University of California Irvine Medical School. This continues a trend over the last 20 years: Between 2006 and 2015, the number of high school seniors with a driver’s license dropped from 81% to 72%, It may seem mind-boggling to adults who have been driving for decades that anyone would delay such a milestone, but it makes sense given the economic and mental health concerns surrounding teens, Vaca added. Still, putting off getting a driver’s license may have impacts on teens safety as well as their development of independence, experts say. Here’s what parents need to know. There are several factors contributing to teens being reluctant to start driving, and some are practical. It used to be that only kids in cities with public transportation like New York City and Washington DC could easily get around town. Now with the availability of rideshare apps, more teens can get where they need to go, said psychologist Dr. Lisa Damour, author of “ : Raising Connected, Capable, and Compassionate Adolescents.” They’re also so busy with all the extra activities they think they need to get into college. A found that most teens feel the pressure to get good grades and list academics as one of their biggest stressors. A lot of teenagers “are doing so much more work than you and I ever did in high school,” Damour added. Teens also socialize a lot online, she said, which means they don’t need to leave home to hang out with friends. Economics also plays a part. Parents and caregivers who need to spend more time working to keep the family afloat don’t have time to give driving lessons, Vaca said. “When we have an economic downturn, things kind of tighten up. People drive less. They travel in cars less,” he added. Mental health concerns are common among today’s teens. responded to the 2023 said they experience persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness. That’s a big problem that often keeps teens from getting their license, said Dr. Rhonda Boyd, psychologist in the department of child and adolescent psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Boyd works with adolescents who have mood disorders such as anxiety and depression, and she has found that teens with mental health conditions often delay getting their driver’s licenses. Teens with depression usually have less energy and may isolate themselves and have trouble concentrating, which can impact them accomplishing goals, Boyd said. “Maybe just getting through school takes up so much of the time and energy that they have,” she said. “Extra things such as getting driver’s license or doing things that may lead to more independence are really harder.” When it comes to anxiety, teens may have fears and concerns about their next and more independent stage of life, so they may avoid those things that bring them there, Boyd added. Maybe it is a relief not to have your teen eager to get on the road, but it does come with some consequences, Vaca said. Being able to get around on their own –– which in many places means driving a car –– opens up other opportunities for teens to practice the things they will need to do in adulthood, he said. Those landmarks include getting summer jobs, getting themselves to sports or other extracurricular obligations, and managing their own health care appointments. “You’re not learning those experiences that you need to build on for later on,” Boyd said. There is also a safety element that becomes especially concerning when teens wait until they are adults to first learn to drive, Vaca said. The United States has a graduated driver’s license system, meaning there are rules, restrictions and educational requirements that taper off the more experience they have behind the wheel. First, a teen gets their permit and has to drive with an adult. Even when they get licensed, there is a period with measures to reduce risk such as not allowing night driving or limiting who they can have in their car when they drive, he added. “Driving is a really complex task. It’s a complex behavior, and we forget about that after we’ve been driving 10, 15, 20, 30 years,” Vaca said. For the most part, that easing into driving doesn’t apply when someone gets their license as an adult, he said. Still, while it is helpful to have your teen learn to drive under a graduated program and gain their independence behind the wheel in stages, younger isn’t always better, Vaca added. “There are developmental neuro-development pieces that are really important with executive decision-making,” he said. “These sorts of things, working memory and inhibitory control … are really important, and those things mature over time.” Does this mean you should make your teen get a license even if they don’t want to? That doesn’t tend to work out well, Damour said. “The question becomes: who is it a problem for? Because if the family is tired of driving the kid around and wants to be relieved of carpool taxi duties, they’re certainly well within their rights to say, ‘we’re going ask you to do this,’” she said. If your teen would rather utilize a rideshare than get their own license, then the teen should be responsible for paying for it, Damour added. But ideally, conversations about driving would start early with teens –– because they will be 15 or 16 before you know it, Vaca said. Families should have an eye on their child’s emotional maturity and development, he said. Are they responsible enough to get behind the wheel? Are they ready for the responsibility of driving? Also, be aware of the possibility that a delay in these milestones could be due to an untreated mental health condition and seek out resources for your teen if you think that may be the case, Boyd added.",

    "content": "As someone , Madison Marilla would often feel left out as her neurotypical friends would get in relationships and go on dates in high school. At the time, she tried to invite some other friends with special needs to prom with her, but they said they were too shy to attend a big school event, she said. “This happened in high school quite a bit, because … emotionally, I was developmentally delayed, but not intellectually,” she said. “I did not understand the complex social skills involved in dating when I was in high school that most people my age understood at the time.” Watching Netflix’s reality show, “Love on the Spectrum,” inspired Marilla, now 27, to give dating another try. She is one of the participants on the US version of the series’ third season, which premiered on April 2 on Autism Awareness Day. and 1 in 45 adults in the United States have autism, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Worldwide, about , or 75 million people, have received a diagnosis of autism, says the advocacy organization Autism Speaks. Autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, is categorized by a range of symptoms, including various challenges with social communication and interaction, but many adults still desire to lead active social lives. Navigating the dating world as someone with autism was tricky for Marilla, and her first date on the show did not go as she had hoped. He was sensitive to noises at the restaurant where they went on their date, and they didn’t have many similar interests. Still, she didn’t give up after the one date and is now telling people that “finding love on the spectrum is possible.” During the process, Marilla learned how to find the balance of stepping outside one’s comfort zone, but not too far to where it could be disorienting for people both on and off the spectrum, said Jennifer Cook, the on-camera neurodiversity expert for the show, who also has an autism diagnosis. Cook often with a goal to have more connected lives and relationships, and helps them understand and identify hidden social rules. “It’s important for everybody to do things that are outside of their comfort zones, wherever you fall on the human spectrum,” Cook said. “It’s what makes us better and more creative and more fabulous individuals.” Here’s what Cook and several participants from the show shared about what it’s like going outside of the comfort zone for people on the spectrum, and their advice can apply to anyone trying to date in the 21st century. When Marilla was preparing for her first date, she met with Cook beforehand. She wanted to know things such as what she should talk about with her date, and whether she could bring items that make her comfortable — Marilla has an impressive collection of dolls and often brings a few along on outings. Marilla’s first date on the show might have been a good example of what Cook describes as the layers to stepping outside one’s comfort zone. Marilla, who had been on dates before and enjoys going out, was in what Cook calls the “learning zone.” “We’re in that midplace where we’re engaged, but we’re not unfocused, either by boredom or by panic. We’re feeling curious and interested in the people and places and things that are around us. We want to learn. We want to acquire new relationships and new skills,” Cook said. “It’s the Goldilocks thing.” But Marilla’s date, who had expressed on the show he was uncomfortable by the restaurant noise before the pair moved outside, was most likely in what Cook refers to as the “panic zone,” Marilla said. “That’s when you’re in a place of extreme feelings. So, you might feel confused, you might feel disoriented, insecure or even inept, like ‘I can’t do this,’” Cook said. “When we’re in that zone, we can’t take in any new information, we can’t think flexibly, we can’t communicate well with others.” That’s true for everyone, Cook noted. “This is not unique to autistic individuals.” When going outside the comfort zone, Cook often tells people on the spectrum who seek her advice to set goals that reflect what one can control. Even though Marilla didn’t find her first date to be a good match, she had still accomplished what she wanted to do, which was go on a date. Because she didn’t give up, Marilla went on another first date and found a better match. And yes, the pair was still going on dates after the show stopped filming, she said. Abbey Romeo, 26, who was diagnosed with autism at 2 years old, has been a participant of “Love on the Spectrum” since the show’s first season, during which she met her current boyfriend. They have been dating for nearly four years. During her first date, Romeo remembers feeling very nervous. “I felt like I was going to throw up because I had no memories connected with David (Isaacman, her boyfriend). We didn’t go to school together,” she said. “But I found out that we have a lot of things in common — not everything, but a lot of things.” When trying new things, what Romeo’s mom taught her helped a lot — speaking positively to herself when she is feeling nervous. “You could say, ‘Everything’s going to be OK. It’s totally normal to feel this way.’ And I also say, ‘I think I can. I think I can,’ just like the little engine that could, but instead, I’m the little engine that did,” Romeo said. The couple also “understand each other’s sensory needs,” Romeo said, which is important as “there are many different types of autism.” Sometimes, they each need breaks from each other or the world, which can involve going on their phones or taking a moment to be alone in another room. While Romeo and her boyfriend have a lot in common, such as their love for animals, particularly lions, they also have different interests that they have shown to one another, such as different foods to try and places to see. Cook often gets asked about the challenge of hearing and understanding someone else’s perspective. While not specific to those with autism, it is often a challenge shared by people on the spectrum. “That’s where you get the misunderstanding that autistic people are unempathetic,” Cook said. “That could not be more wrong.” It is called the “theory of mind,” which is the ability to understand and attribute other people’s thoughts and emotions, and can be difficult for autistic people to do without being taught or having previously experienced the other person’s perspective, Cook said. There is also the challenge of anticipating what someone will say and then naturally responding to it in real time. Cook’s advice, for those on the spectrum or not, is to be authentic. It is OK to acknowledge the awkward silence of a date, or to bring a small doll or two if that will help someone feel more confident in stepping outside of their comfort zone, she said. For those looking to support someone in their life who is autistic and wants to step into their learning zone, Cook suggests teaching and practicing coping skills with that person. Her favorite is a method that uses all five senses and helps someone slow down when in anxiety-inducing situations: “Identify five things that you can see, four things that you can hear, three things you can feel, two you can taste and one you can smell.” As people who are both on the spectrum, Romeo and Marilla agree that it is important to step out of your comfort zone, even if it can be scary. Marilla’s friend gave her this advice, which she shared: “Life is at its best when you’re outside your comfort zone, and it’s best to let yourself out, not hold yourself in,” she said. “And those are very true words I stick to this day, and they have helped me with the dating process.” .",

    "content": ". The importance of is often in the spotlight. But when it comes to the ties that bind men, that less than half of men report being satisfied with their friendships. often starts around middle to late adolescence and deepens into adulthood. Kim Evensen, the Norwegian-born founder of — a nonprofit organization created to help empower men’s friendships — had an epiphany about what was missing from his own friendships with other men when he was 25. “I saw these rules that we as men often feel we have to follow,” said Evensen, who is based in Oslo, the Norwegian capital. “Like ‘boys don’t cry,’ we don’t express vulnerability toward each other, we don’t get too close to each other.” Evensen found himself tired of the meaningless hangouts with other men he realized had dominated his friendships, such as grabbing a beer together or being a workout buddy. “It has to be something more, because if I settled for what popular culture sets as the standard for male friendships, then I, as a man, won’t have a lot of meaningful friendships,” he said. Evensen turned to experts on male friendships, including , a researcher and a professor of applied psychology at New York University, to seek guidance on how to strengthen and understand his own bonds with his male friends — and how to help other men, too. In 2017, he founded Brothers, turning what had started out as an into a full-time career. Evensen has written two books on the topic of male friendships — “ ” and “ ” — and he’s traveled to Australia, the United States, Kenya and beyond to speak about men’s friendships and masculinity. At his lectures, Evensen asks men about how they want their friendships to look and about the closest moments they’ve shared with their male friends. “I really want men to develop closer and deeper friendships — just saying that — I get a lot of funny reactions,” he said. I talked to him about the roadblocks men face in their friendships with other men — and how to move past them. You say the first roadblock to deep male friendships stems from a taboo of even discussing them. How can men get past that? You have to push through the awkwardness and acknowledge your friendships. I learned from Dr. Niobe Way that most adolescent boys express a deep affection and love for their close male friends in private interviews. But when their statements are read out loud to larger groups of teenage boys, the boys start laughing and calling it weird or girlish or gay. Talking about your friendship with another man might mean pushing through some awkwardness. But think of it this way: If you want to get muscles, you’re going to have to work out. And if you want to have good friendships, you have to work for it. Mention the elephant in the room, say, “Hey, I really appreciate and value you, and I feel like I don’t say it enough. And I want to invest more in our friendship.” That’s a good place to start. You talk about how society has dumbed down male friendships. How does that affect those bonds? If men settle for popular culture’s standards of male bonding, they won’t have a lot of meaningful connections. It’s generally assumed that male friendships are supposed to be easygoing and emotionally risk-free. Low-maintenance hangouts, with little or no commitment. So how do you try to cultivate something deeper? Friendships are like relationships. They’re always about two people. A lot of guys only hang out in groups. If that’s you, try hanging out or grabbing a beer with just one of your friends. If you always hang out in groups, you never get to really know the people around you and create a friendship just between the two of you. Point to this article, even, so you have something to discuss other than yourself. Open up yourself. If you do, your friend will see it as a sign of trust. If you are the one to start, maybe he’ll open up to you, too. How does a narrow-minded view of masculinity affect male friendships? The psychiatrist and family therapist wrote a book called “ ” that really resonated with me. It’s about how a lot of men are bound by this unwritten rule that they should only express manly emotions. But emotional intimacy is a human trait that’s necessary to create close friendships. We have this idea that a real man should think about sex all the time and use women as a currency to prove to the boys that he’s a man — and, by all means, avoid expressing any of the so-called opposite qualities like joy, compassion, empathy, love and vulnerability. Especially not in front of other men. Ask yourself, do you think your friend would value it if you would express empathy or compassion toward them? Some men will say, “We don’t need this, or we’re not like that. Don’t try to turn us into a woman.” But you have to try to demolish that argument. Friendships built on insecurity, where men constantly have to prove their manhood, are a breeding ground for toxic attitudes and stupid decision-making. You say that the sexualization of love has impacted male friendships. How so? So many boys and men avoid closeness or affection in their friendships just to make sure nothing will be misunderstood, that they won’t be called gay. An intimate conversation, a heartfelt encouragement or a hug without a firm pat on the back might create suspicion, so you better play it safe. The words “love” and “sex” have been used interchangeably. And without being aware of it, we have formed perceptions about love and closeness that aren’t true. It kills closeness in male friendships. I’ve asked myself why do we say things like “I love you bro, no homo.” I’ve never heard a 3-year-old boy say that to his friend, or girls say that to their girlfriends. Maybe start a conversation with your friend about why men even say those things? You can tell your friend you want to be able to express that you love each other — or if that’s too strong, say you care about each other. When a man gets a girlfriend or partner, you say it can become an excuse to neglect friendships with the boys. What can be done about that? It’s so common that many of us have just accepted it as a way of life — as a legitimate way to neglect our friendships. And it kind of makes sense. After all, why prioritize a bunch of shallow hangouts when you can invest in a relationship with someone you’re allowed to deeply connect with? We need to be able to value romantic relationships without neglecting friendships and vice versa. Would you appreciate it if your friend ditched you for a girl? Probably you wouldn’t, so don’t do that to your friend either. Make sure your friend gets to know your girlfriend since she’s going to be part of your life. Expecting that our romantic partner should cover all our emotional and relationship needs — basically be our everything — might sound romantic in a movie. But in real life, it’s pretty unhealthy.",

    "content": ". More than worldwide have dementia, a number expected to nearly triple by 2050. Deaths from strokes the same year, and of adults experience depression later in life. While the numbers are striking, there’s a growing body of evidence showing that many of these cases may not be genetically fated, but rather could be delayed or prevented altogether by addressing health factors generally within our control. At least 17 factors contribute to dementia, stroke and late-life depression, according to an extensive in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry. Addressing the 17 factors can reduce people’s risk for all three conditions. Those factors are, in no order of importance: “This study just really shows how powerful lifestyle and behavioral changes are for age-related brain diseases,” said senior study author Dr. Sanjula Singh, an instructor in neurology at Harvard Medical School and principal investigator at the Brain Care Labs at Massachusetts General Hospital. “Ultimately, we hope that people feel like there’s a hopeful message in here — that there are actually so many things that you can work on, and then not only your risk of stroke is lower, but also of dementia and/or of late-life depression,” Singh noted. In the past, studies, tools or risk-prediction models have usually focused on these conditions individually. “From a human perspective, that doesn’t make a lot of sense,” Singh said. Ideally, people wouldn’t want to develop any of these conditions, she added, so the research team wanted to find shared risk factors so people can essentially achieve multiple goals using the same tools. The authors reviewed 59 meta-analyses — syntheses of data from multiple similar studies — that were published between 2000 and 2023 and had investigated the effects of modifiable risk factors on stroke, dementia and/or late-life depression among adults who weren’t previously diagnosed with these conditions. All 17 factors were shared by at least two of the conditions, but there were no meta-analyses on relationships between late-life depression and 11 of the health measures: alcohol intake, BMI, blood sugar, cognitive activity, diet, hearing loss, kidney function, pain, physical activity, social engagement and stress, according to the study. Of all the measures, blood pressure had the biggest impact. A is below 120 over 80 millimeters of mercury, or mm Hg. People with a level of 140/90 mm Hg or greater were more than twice as likely to have a stroke, 20% more likely to develop dementia and 16% more likely to experience depression. Other top influential factors were smoking, sleep, physical activity and blood sugar. “Grouping these all together is important, because I think different people derive different levels of motivation to make a behavior change” based on their personal concerns, such as a family history of dementia, stroke or depression, said Dr. Richard Isaacson, preventive neurologist and director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida. Isaacson wasn’t involved in the study. “Data studies like this can help empower people to make meaningful changes in their day-to-day lives,” Isaacson added. If 17 items seem overwhelming, look at it as a menu from which you can choose a few items — and work your way through the list over time, Singh said. But also know these factors overlap, she said — if you’re improving your diet and exercise, for example, you’re probably improving several things on that list, including blood pressure, blood sugar, sleep and cholesterol. Not sure what to choose? Here’s how you can address what experts said are some of the most important determinants of dementia, stroke and depression. High blood pressure means less blood flow to the brain, which has a direct relationship with stroke and dementia, but is also associated with depression by way of reducing neurotransmitters in the brain, Isaacson said. To address high blood pressure, you can have your level checked by a machine at a drugstore, a doctor or a home device, experts said. and getting are important for reducing blood pressure, as well as exercising, losing excess weight, managing stress and seeing a sleep specialist if you . A doctor can determine whether you also need medication. If you smoke, there you can take right now to quit, which concern identifying your triggers, learning from relapses, using helplines and apps, and speaking with doctors who can help you devise a treatment plan. For physical activity, know that any amount is better than none — and the World Health Organization the type, frequency and duration of exercise you need depending on your age. Older adults need of sleep nightly. You can help ensure a by keeping your room cool, quiet and dark; not drinking alcohol or caffeine in the several hours before bed; limiting screen time at night; and having a bedtime routine. Exercise, weight management and a healthy diet that limits refined carbohydrates and added sugars can also levels. The findings from the latest study inform the existing Brain Care Score, which was at the McCance Center for Brain Health at Massachusetts General Hospital to help people gauge and manage their risk for dementia or stroke without medical procedures. The 21-point score refers to how a person fares on 12 health-related factors concerning physical, lifestyle and social-emotional components of health. To this list, the new study adds pain, depressive symptoms, hearing loss, cognitive activity and kidney disease. Researchers behind the score anticipate an updated version will be published later this year. For now, you can take the .",

    "content": "When Penny Ashford’s father was diagnosed with early-stage at age 62, she knew the devastating brain disorder might one day steal her memory. In her late 50s, her free-floating anxiety turned to outright panic when she began struggling to find words. “I couldn’t tell a story. I couldn’t get my words out,” said Ashford, now 61. “I remember sitting at a dinner party one time, and I couldn’t finish my thoughts. It was the most unbelievable moment. “I came home and sobbed and told my husband, ‘Something is wrong with me. I can’t talk,’” she said. “I was petrified.” Today, after a complete revamp of her lifestyle and overall health, Ashford’s struggles with retrieving words have eased, while measures of amyloid and tau proteins and neuroinflammation — — have fallen. Ashford knows about these improvements because she’s part of a unique study tracking her progress via key blood biomarkers now being used to help diagnose early dementia. Instead of relying on painful spinal taps and expensive brain scans, these blood tests are heralded as a new, less invasive and time-consuming way to determine risk and aid in an earlier diagnosis of Alzheimer’s. The preliminary data, presented Monday at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting in San Diego, analyzed biomarkers on 54 participants in an ongoing preventive neurology study called the , or BioRAND. “The field is primarily using various biomarkers to determine if you have dementia or not,” said lead study author Dr. Kellyann Niotis, a preventive neurologist who researches risk reduction for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Boca Raton, Florida. “No one is really looking at the changes in these biomarkers as outcome measures, as a way of tracking progress in a person’s journey to improve their brain,” Niotis said. “We believe these biomarkers may show how the disease progression is being modified biologically by a person’s actions.” Alzheimer’s blood tests are the key to widespread prevention of dementia, experts say. If people can be diagnosed in their doctor’s office, they can more immediately move into preventive care and implement lifestyle changes designed to slow the progression of their disease. The problem, said senior study author Dr. Richard Isaacson, is the variability in how well these new blood biomarker tests work to predict or track disease progression. “There is a dirty little secret in the Alzheimer’s blood testing community where so many testing platforms, biotech companies, and a flurry of new blood tests are released,” Isaacson said, “but it’s unclear which of these tests are most accurate to track progression and evaluate response to therapies to slow progression toward dementia.” To address this gap, Isaacson’s research team and collaborators at five sites across the United States and Canada set forth to evaluate and eventually cross-compare the clinical use of what the neurologist said he believes will one day become “the cholesterol test for the brain.” “In the not so far future, people in their 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s and beyond will get a baseline test to evaluate risk and help track progress over time — similar to how traditional cholesterol tests are used today,” said Isaacson, founder of one of the first Alzheimer’s prevention clinics in the United States. “Our eventual goal is to offer a blood panel at cost to help democratize access and broaden the ability for people to receive care,” he added. Measuring levels of both amyloid and tau is key to understanding and diagnosing Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia. play a key role in the development of Alzheimer’s when small clusters gather at synapses in the brain and interfere with the nerve cells’ ability to communicate. Such plaques are thought to trigger changes in which form into tangles in parts of the brain controlling memory. Tau tangles are also implicated in other such as , or FTD, and in which abnormal clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein accumulate in the brain’s neurons. The biomarker plasma phosphorylated tau 217, or p-tau217 for short, is a top contender in the diagnosis of and early-stage Alzheimer’s disease. Its cousin, p-tau 181, is also a helpful indicator. P-tau 217 is a “beautiful marker for Alzheimer’s,” Dr. Maria Carrillo, chief science officer of the Alzheimer’s Association, told CNN in an . “You’re not really measuring amyloid, but the test is telling you it’s there, and that’s been backed up with objective PET (positron emission tomography) scans that can see amyloid in the brain,” Carrillo said. “… If you have elevated tau in your brain, however, then we know that’s a sign of another type of dementia.” Another biomarker test is the amyloid 42/40 ratio scan, which measures two types of amyloid proteins, another key biomarker of Alzheimer’s disease. At times, such tests work best when used together. In an , a combination of both amyloid and p-tau 217 tests, called the amyloid probability score, showed a 90% accuracy rate in determining whether memory loss is due to Alzheimer’s disease. Glial fibrillary acidic protein, or GFAP, and neurofilament light chain, or NfL, which indicate brain inflammation and degenerative decay, are also helpful in tracking the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. Dozens more biomarkers are being tested in labs around the world. Isaacson’s team at the is studying more than 125 individual markers from a variety of commercial and research-based tests, some of which may soon be available in a clinical setting. Why investigate so many? Because personalized medicine may demand it, Niotis said. “Neurodegenerative diseases present so differently in different people,” she said. “It may be we will need a very nuanced, individualized approach in clinical practice to monitor the effectiveness of what we’re doing for a given patient.” The ongoing preventive neurology study called BioRAND reported on 71 participants, with   biomarkers being analyzed on 54 people. The other 17 people served as the control group. The group of 54 received a series of personalized lifestyle recommendations designed to improve their brain. Such interventions have been shown in to improve memory and thinking skills by five points on a cognitive test for people with mild cognitive impairment. The recommendations include a focus on blood pressure control, diet, exercise, stress reduction, sleep hygiene and weight control as well as addressing metabolic, hormonal and nutrient imbalances. Medications, vitamins and supplements are tailored to each person’s unique needs. Similar to a led by Isaacson and Niotis, people who fulfilled at least 60% of the lifestyle recommendations were considered high compliance, while those who implemented less than 60% were low compliance. Periodic blood tests tracked progress in various brain biomarkers. The outcome? The more work people put into change, the better their brains. Just look at Penny Ashford. “My blood work was terrible; my eating habits were terrible. I didn’t exercise, so my muscle tone was really bad — I had no muscles in my bottom or on my thighs,” Ashford said. “I got the lecture of a lifetime,” she said. “They told me, ‘Your window is closing, your markers are so bad. Either you’ve got to do this, or you’re done.’” A lifelong sugar addict, Ashford stopped eating sweets. “I used to think I had a chemical imbalance because I was such a crazy freak about sugar — I could polish off a whole bag of Oreos, no problem, and I love ice cream,” Ashford said. “I haven’t had a dessert. I haven’t had ice cream. I haven’t had anything except fruit since a year ago March.” She began an intense exercise program of cardio and resistance training, along with yoga for stress reduction, and moved to a plant-based Mediterranean style of eating. Under a doctor’s supervision, she added supplements and vitamins to boost energy and lower stress. “She was a 10 out of 10 with her diet and exercise,” Niotis said. “She lost around 30 pounds and gained lean muscle mass. It was amazing.” A year later, Ashford’s blood biomarkers told a completely different story about her brain health. Her p-tau 217 dropped by 43% and her p-tau 181 by 75%. “We also looked at GFAP and neurofilament light, the markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration,” Niotis said. “Penny’s GFAP went down by 66% and her NfL went down by 84%. “These are really impressive changes in these markers of neuronal health,” she said. “And the best part about it is it really did track with her clinical symptoms. Her word retrieval problems improved, and she felt so much better.” Ashford wasn’t the only in the study. Blood biomarkers also significantly improved across the entire group given risk reduction advice, Isaacson said, even those who were not as committed as Ashford. “I’ve lost count on how many people have shown blood markers of brain disease trend in the right direction, but every time it amazes me,” he said. “For over 20 years, I was told that what is happening right in front of my eyes was impossible, but the patients’ stories, clinical improvements and test results speak for themselves.” Much more work remains before blood testing for Alzheimer’s becomes a routine part of clinical practice, Isaacson said. “Our group has a saying, ‘Promise not to overpromise.’ By this we mean it’s critical to be transparent about the current limitations of these tests, and the variability across different platforms,” he said. While science works out the kinks, Ashford counts herself lucky to be able to track changes in her biomarker numbers — a key motivator in her journey toward better brain health. “It’s huge, huge,” she said. “I’m so proud of myself. And each success that I have empowers me to do more, keep going and not let up. “I look back at my dad. He didn’t have any of these options. I watched my dad deteriorate, and I thank God, I am so lucky. We are so lucky.”",

    "content": "Although often invisible, chronic pain is everywhere. More than have pain lasting more than three months. With medical treatment and lost productivity of up to $635 billion annually in the United States, pain is expensive as well as debilitating. The fact that traditional Western and alternative medicine have yet to confirm either a cause or a solution doesn’t help. Psychotherapist is determined to interrupt this bleak narrative with a cure rooted in evidence-based brain science and mind-body medicine. In her new book, “ ,” the author, podcaster and public speaker shares her method for eliminating not just chronic pain but also long Covid-19, migraines, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and many other conditions. Where medication, physical therapy, supplements, procedures and treatments have failed, her approach, using a targeted writing practice called JournalSpeak, offers a possible cure. Mind-body medicine is a paradigm that recognizes the influence of stored trauma and repressed emotions on physical health. My mentor, , was a pioneering practitioner who challenged the Western assumption that pain or discomfort always correlates directly with the affected body part. His scientific work uncovered that, while real, some physical symptoms are not always tied to pathology in the body. Dr. Sarno called this condition Tension Myoneural Syndrome, or TMS, which is an umbrella term for the epidemic of chronic conditions that do not resolve by treating the symptomatic area of the body. Instead, chronic pain and other conditions can result from nervous system dysregulation that creates physical symptoms in response to stored trauma and an overflow of repressed emotions. First, it helps to remember that all humans have unconscious processes that are essential to living, like circulating our blood, breathing or making our heart beat. In a sense, the unconscious nervous system signaling that causes chronic pain is equally reflexive. Beneath consciousness, each of us has an emotional reservoir that holds the extent of our grief, rage, terror, despair and shame. The extremity of these feelings is kept below the surface, under the cover of darkness, because feeling the pain of these emotions all the time would make it impossible to live our lives. Humans are a social species, and our need for connection is as imperative as food and water. If we were constantly aware of the depth of our emotional pain, we’d be too shut down to connect with others. So, our nervous system tries to keep that pain under wraps. But everyone reaches a point in life when this reservoir starts to bubble over. Too much stress, trauma or some devastating life event and all the emotions that have been stuffed down start to knock at the door of consciousness. That’s when our nervous system steps in. Our nervous system has to protect us against threats. Your brain perceives your repressed emotional world and stored trauma as predators, seeing them as far more dangerous problems than the physical manifestations of pain — because they’re not easy to solve. And so, alarm bells go off. The nervous system switches into fight, flight, freeze or fawn mode. When your emotional “reservoir” becomes overwhelmed, your brain sends pain signals as a protective strategy. If you are someone who struggles with back pain, for instance, that’s likely your nervous system triggering symptoms to keep you safe — I call this “safe in the un-safest way.” Back pain might trigger you to take a pill, get into bed and cancel your plans for the day. This restores to the brain a sense of control and familiarity. However unwanted consciously, illness and injury are protective. They require us to slow down and allow us to ask for help, draw boundaries, say no and stay home. And just as you don’t have a choice about whether to pull your hand off a hot stove, you don’t get to decide not to have back pain right now if your reservoir is overflowing. The pain is very real; it just originates from emotional rather than physical stressors. Here’s the fascinating part — all get fired by the brain and nervous system, landing in different bodily systems and muscles. . So, when you burn your finger, the nerves in your finger tell the brain that the sensory environment has changed. Then the brain, in a flash, interprets the level of danger and sends pain signals back to the finger. Pain’s No. 1 is to protect you. With TMS, the brain sends these same pain signals as a , even without physical injury. Today’s brain imaging technology even reveals that whether someone is experiencing emotional heartbreak or just broke their ankle the same part of the brain . : Treatment has three key components. The first part of my prescription is knowledge. I need to you about the and provide enough to help you believe and not dismiss that this is what’s happening in your human body. The second component of treatment is JournalSpeak — a specific writing practice I developed to release emotions. The third is practicing patience and kindness for yourself — self-compassion is a verb! : JournalSpeak is a 20-minute, unfiltered writing practice, informed by your understanding of the nervous-system science, where you express your most unreasonable, raw emotions. This practice is like putting a ladle into the reservoir and dumping it out systematically, one day at a time. Once the level drops below maximum capacity, the pain signals stop firing, because your nervous system no longer feels the urgency to protect you from conscious awareness. After the 20 minutes, you destroy the writing. It’s about releasing, not analyzing. Like blowing your nose into a tissue, you don’t need to look at it again. JournalSpeak is like a venting apparatus for a closed system. Energy is neither created nor destroyed; it shifts from one form to another. The energy of grief and rage and shame and fear gets transformed into physical pain in the closed system of the human body. Writing the most unbridled, impolite, unreasonable, pathetic rant that gives voice to unseen, unheard parts of you opens a relief valve that transfers emotional pain onto the page. Once that energy is vented, the nervous system stops sending physical pain signals. ﻿ Not at all. One person’s fatigue is another’s back pain, is another’s migraine or , or , and so on. The theory at the center of this approach is that there is one genesis for all these symptoms. The same principles can apply to autoimmune conditions, digestive issues and other chronic symptoms. The underlying mechanism is always the same: the nervous system sending signals as a protective response. When people realize that the sensations we feel in our body, no matter what they are, are controlled by the brain and the nervous system, they can understand why it really doesn’t matter how the symptoms are showing up. The central nervous system is the control room for everything in the human experience. More and more scientific remission of pain and other chronic symptoms through mind-body practices. Recently, a by Dr. Michael Donnino, a professor of medicine and emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School, compared three treatment approaches for chronic back pain. The first group continued their existing treatment regimens, while the second took an eight-week mindfulness stress reduction course. Participants in the third group received a 12-week psychophysiological intervention based on Dr. Sarno’s work where they explored their emotional history using mind-body techniques. This group reported significantly less pain than participants in the other groups. About six months later, of people from the mind-body group reported being pain-free. Donnino’s findings from a on long Covid showed that symptoms previously attributed to physical causes resolved with mind-body medicine. First, consult a doctor to ensure that medically treatable diagnoses are not the root cause of your pain. But if you’ve had multiple medical tests with no clear explanation, if your pain moves around, or if it seems triggered by stress, these are potential TMS indicators. The key is understanding that , not just a malfunction. Once you receive a clean bill of health or you’re diagnosed with chronic symptoms deemed incurable, nervous system dysregulation is a likely cause, and it’s time to consider my three-part treatment approach. The goal is to recognize and process your emotions, not necessarily remove every source of stress. You don’t have to blow up your life, quit your job or put your kids up for adoption. You don’t need to change your life; you just need to know how you feel about it. Start with curiosity. Approach your body with compassion, listen to its signals and remember that healing is possible. The beauty of this approach is its fundamental message of hope: Your body is not broken, and you have the power to heal. It’s about understanding the intricate connection between your emotions and physical experience, and learning to work with your nervous system, not against it. Your body is trying to protect you. By understanding this, you can start a profound healing journey. You have so much more power than you realize to affect your physical and emotional health.",

    "content": "I drag myself out of bed in the morning and immediately make a promise that I’m going to go to bed earlier that night. Throughout the first half of my day, I’m considering if a nap might be in the cards for the afternoon. But once bedtime rolls around, I find I couldn’t be more wide awake. While this loop I have found myself in is not a fun one, feeling tired at the “wrong” time is a common complaint  that patients share with their sleep doctors, said Dr. Sonja Schütz, a neurologist specializing in sleep medicine and an associate professor of neurology at the University of Michigan Medical School. Often, a person who struggles with this problem could be perceived as lazy, especially when the issue is commonly seen in teenagers, said Dr. Allison Harvey, a professor of psychology and the director of the Golden Bear Sleep and Mood Research Clinic at the University of California, Berkeley. But the issue is not indicative of willpower or lack thereof, but a sign that someone may be dealing with an issue such as bad sleep hygiene, disturbed sleep throughout the night, or an underlying sleep disorder, Schütz said. It’s worth finding the source of the problems, since getting quality sleep is essential for a person’s overall health and ability to function. “Sleep and having a regularized circadian system (a person’s internal biological 24-hour clock) is essential for our mental health, our physical health, our cognitive health — our ability to think, to solve problems, to be creative — and also our social and behavioral health, Harvey said. “When we’re sleeping well, we’re less likely to be risk taking, impulsive, (and) we’re more likely to get along with people.” Here’s what to do if you find yourself awake or tired at the wrong time of the day. If someone consistently wakes up tired, they first need to start tracking their sleep patterns— when they get into bed every night and when they wake up, said Dr. Michelle Drerup, director of the behavioral sleep medicine program at the Cleveland Clinic Sleep Disorders Center in Ohio. Likely, the issue could be that someone’s circadian rhythm is shifted so that they produce melatonin later than the time they need to go to sleep. In the morning, that melatonin could still be in production mode, causing , a temporary state of grogginess upon waking up, she added. Whether you’re a , which are common descriptors of a person’s chronotype, is directly correlated to a person’s circadian rhythm and the body’s natural inclination to sleep or be alert at certain times of the day. To shift this to better fit someone’s work schedule, consistency is key, Harvey said. But the sleep-wake cycle takes time to tweak and cannot be done in large increments — Harvey recommends going to bed 15 to 30 minutes earlier each night until your body adjusts to the schedule you need. On the weekends, people who are consistently tired throughout the weekdays tend to sleep in, but this routine change will only make it harder to wake up when Monday morning rolls around, Drerup said. She recommends that a person stick to their usual schedule and not sleep in for more than an hour past their usual weekday wake-up time. Other important sleep hygiene habits to keep in mind include how late someone is consuming caffeine and certain foods, heir screen-time habits and the type of media they’re using before bed that could be alerting or anxiety-inducing, Drerup said. For a better wind-down routine, aim to turn off electronics one or two hours before bed, dim the lights in the house and do a calming activity like reading, Schütz said. Similarly, teenagers tend to multitask a lot of different activities before bedtime, such as homework and using social media, which can make winding down difficult, especially as they transition to an age where they than they did as children, Harvey said. In the morning, it could help to stick to a routine that helps the body and brain wake up. “Do something that signals (that) it’s morning — whether that’s going and washing your face, splashing water on your face, brushing your teeth — something to start that forward momentum,” Drerup said. Also, , which harms your sleep. On the other hand, getting light exposure in the morning after waking up can help people feel more awake, she added. Getting in physical activity throughout the day can help your body feel more tired at night, especially when many jobs in the digital age involve a lot of sitting down, Harvey added. that the recommended amount of sleep for adults is seven to nine hours per night, but that can look slightly different from person to person, Schütz said. “It’s very common that people are sleep deprived without being aware of that, because their body needs at least nine hours to feel really rested.” By tracking your sleep and learning the amount where your body feels rested, you can start to establish new habits and have an easier time getting up in the morning, she added. While to be beneficial for cognitive abilities like memory and function, the timing is important — longer naps and napping later in the afternoon could cause someone to feel more alert when bedtime rolls around, Drerup said. A good rule of thumb is to keep naps between 20 and 30 minutes, Schütz said. Fogginess in the morning is a common symptom in people who have a sleep disorder such as obstructive sleep apnea, and a visit with a physician might be needed to rule out underlying disorders, Schütz said. Sometimes, sleep medications such as over-the-counter sleep aids or allergy medication can cause a hangover effect, which could make waking up in the morning difficult, she added. Mental health could be a factor, too. Someone who is depressed can often wake up feeling fatigued, and the sleep inertia that normally lasts around 20 minutes for someone who is not depressed can instead last several hours, Harvey said. While it’s important to aim to get the best sleep you can, it is also important to remember that our bodies are flexible, and when a situation arises where someone may need to unfavorably shift their sleep schedule, such as parents with infants and children who have needs, or taking care of sick relatives or having unusual workweeks, there is no need to panic, Harvey said. “I don’t want people to have that sense of anxiety about sleep, because anxiety won’t help sleep,” Harvey said. “But in general, we should all try to (consistently get good sleep) if we do have .”",

    "content": "Do you find yourself reaching for an to unwind and drift off to sleep? Whether it’s an old-fashioned, a hot toddy or even an espresso martini, many people have a favorite evening beverage that signals the end of a long day. But what’s the history behind this nightly ritual? The tradition of enjoying a drink to promote better sleep — known as a — dates to the early 18th century. The term “nightcap” originally referred to a literal hat worn at night before modern heating, designed to keep the head warm for more restful sleep. Over time, people began associating this warming sensation with the effects of an evening alcoholic drink, an idea that persists in popular culture today. However, as health officials continue to issue warnings about the dangers of alcohol, it might be time to ditch the nightly habit. In January, then-US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy on the cancer risks associated with alcohol consumption and called for updated health warnings on alcoholic beverages. And the negative impact of alcohol can also extend to your sleep. “Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant, which is why it causes drowsiness,” said Dr. Anthony Reffi, a clinical psychologist and assistant scientist at Henry Ford Health’s Sleep Disorders and Research Center in Detroit, via email. “However, it negatively impacts sleep quality, causing night-time awakenings that leave people feeling tired the next day.” The effects of alcohol on sleep vary and are influenced by factors such as sex, body weight, metabolism and the amount of alcohol consumed, Dr. Deirdre Conroy, clinical director of the behavioral sleep medicine program and clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan, said via email. While a higher dose of alcohol generally makes it easier to fall asleep, it also increases the likelihood of waking up in the middle of the night, Conroy said. Alcohol works by inhibiting excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain — the chemicals responsible for firing up functions in the body and keeping it alert — making people feel sleepy more quickly, said Dr. Timothy Roehrs, former director of research at the Sleep Disorders and Research Center of Henry Ford Health System. Drinking alcohol before bed raises blood alcohol content, which disrupts rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep, a critical phase of the sleep cycle responsible for cognitive functions such as . During the first three to four hours of sleep, alcohol is reaching its peak concentration in the body, which explains the initial onset of that sleepy sensation. However, in the second half of the night, people will experience a “rebound effect,” resulting in more frequent awakenings and disturbances as the night progresses and alcohol is metabolized, Reffi said. Moderate and high doses of alcohol also reduce the overall amount of REM sleep an individual gets in a night, Reffi added. Research also shows that people with chronic insomnia may find temporary relief from alcohol use before bed, but the effects are short-lived. conducted at Henry Ford Health’s Sleep Disorders and Research Center found that participants who drank a high dose of alcohol before bed initially slept longer than those who consumed a low dose or none. However, when assessed a week later, those differences disappeared, and the high-dose drinkers were sleeping less and experiencing fewer minutes in deep sleep, Reffi said. Beyond affecting the quality of your sleep, regular alcohol consumption before bed can have long-term consequences, such as increased tolerance to its sedative effects and a higher risk of alcohol dependence. Additionally, combining alcohol with other medications taken at bedtime could intensify its calmative effects, potentially leading to injuries if you get out of bed during the night, Conroy said. If you’re hoping for more restorative sleep, it may be time to reconsider your evening routine and explore healthier alternatives to a nightly drink. Nonalcoholic beverages have become an increasingly popular choice for those looking to unwind without the negative side effects of alcohol. Many brands now offer options that mimic the same “bite” associated with cocktails while still providing a satisfying drink to help people relax before bed, Reffi said. Alternatively, herbal teas or choices such as a “ ” can also provide a calming effect similar to alcohol. However, drinking too much liquid before bed can also lead to disruptions and frequent trips to the restroom in the middle of the night, so it’s best to avoid drinking too much close to bedtime. It’s also important to steer clear of caffeine for at least eight to 10 hours before sleep to avoid interfering with your body’s natural sleep cycles. For those who consistently struggle with sleep disruptions, talking to a trained professional can help uncover any underlying issues, Conroy said, but establishing a consistent wind-down routine can help signal to your body that it’s time to rest. She added that incorporating relaxation techniques, avoiding stimulating activities before bed and limiting naps can greatly improve sleep quality as well as exercising regularly. “Try other activities that help promote relaxation before bed: read, meditate, journal, pray or spend time with loved ones,” Reffi said. “Avoid activities that stress you out before bed — turn off the news, get off social media and put your phone on do not disturb.”",

    "content": "The future of Ukraine. A looming trade war. Stock market turmoil. Rising prices for consumers in the midst of thousands of layoffs, with more to come. Whether your politics make you anxious or exhilarated by the events of the day, there’s no doubt that change and uncertainty breed stress. Stress, of course, can . For some, that stress can lead to insomnia, an inability to fall or stay asleep or waking up much earlier than desired. Chronic insomnia may lead to serious health issues, including and “Everyone has a specific threshold for insomnia, and sometimes precipitating factors can break through the threshold and you can’t sleep. The stressors could be personal, professional, environmental, even political,” said sleep researcher Dr. Ana Krieger, a professor of clinical medicine in the departments of medicine, neurology and genetic medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City. Cases of insomnia have tended to rise during previous political and societal upheaval, said Michelle Drerup, a psychologist in the sleep disorders clinic of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. “We’ve seen this throughout the past several decades,” Drerup said. “Oftentimes it’s people who are vulnerable or people who already have occasional difficulties, and this tips them over the edge.” Good sleepers may be more immune to the effects of stress on their nighttime slumber, Krieger said. However, for people who have trouble drifting off or for those with sleep fragmentation — brief but frequent awakenings during the night — ongoing stress from the news can turn the occasional bad night of sleep into a . Age is also a risk factor — older adults may already have issues with sleep due to existing health conditions, medications and chronic pain, and so may be especially sensitive to additional stress. Women also have higher rates of insomnia than men, as do people with family members who have insomnia, Drerup said. “There’s a genetic predisposition, but there’s also a behavioral impact,” she added. “If I am in an environment where my parents are up late, that will potentially impact my sleep schedule. Family history of mental health issues, specifically anxiety, is another predisposing factor.” Having an occasional bout of insomnia is common, said sleep specialist Jennifer Mundt, an associate clinical professor of family and preventive medicine at the University of Utah who sees patients at the school’s Sleep Wake Center. “Insomnia is a normal reaction to change in stress, even a good change,” Mundt said. “You might get married, get a new job, have a baby, but they still create stress and that can still disrupt your sleep. So it’s quite normal to have a temporary bout of insomnia, and then typically, sleep will go back to baseline.” However, some people develop unhelpful habits and ways of thinking about sleep that create a vicious cycle, said Krieger, who is also director of the Center for Sleep Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian. “Eventually, many people develop what are called perpetuating factors, or ways they try to cope, which often are not healthy or good for sleep and which can cause chronic insomnia,” she said. “We have patients who can’t sleep and start watching the news or read it on their phones. They turn on the lights, they eat. We even have some who play tennis or exercise in the middle of the night.” While experts encourage getting out of bed after 30 minutes of tossing and turning, it’s not wise to expose your eyes to the blue light of electronic devices during the middle of the night. Doing so just sends a message to the brain that turns off melatonin, the hormone that triggers sleepiness, Krieger said. Eating during the night can lead to heartburn, indigestion and acid reflux, which can disrupt sleep. Exercising in the middle of the night raises body temperature, heart rate and stress hormones, which can derail attempts to doze off. One of the worst behaviors a person with occasional insomnia can do is fret about it, said Dr. Elizabeth Klerman, a professor of neurology in the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School. “However, I can sympathize with that behavior. I don’t know about you, but if I’m awake in the middle of the night, I think about how the world’s horrible, everything is bad, nobody likes me and I’m never going to go back to sleep again,” said Klerman, who is also a sleep researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital and sleep physician at Brigham and Young Women’s Hospital in Boston. “We owe it to people who are awake in the middle of the night to study what is happening, and provide more support for them,” she said. There are tried and true techniques that can help you get your sleep back on track, experts say. First, stop doomscrolling. “I talk to a lot of my patients about setting a news curfew,” Mundt said. “Checking news and social media right up until bedtime won’t work. You need a buffer of an hour or so between keeping track of what’s going on and giving yourself time to unwind so you can sleep.” Avoid substances such as alcohol and drugs to wind down at the end of the day, as those can backfire, she said. “Those can just make your sleep worse,” Mundt said. “Avoid having too much caffeine during the day to try to compensate for not sleeping well — that can become a vicious cycle where you don’t sleep well, and then you have more caffeine, and then you don’t sleep well.” And remember, if you’re always thinking about how to get sleep, the harder it becomes to fall asleep, Mundt said. “When people start having insomnia, they can fixate on that, which then becomes a big source of anxiety,” she said. “It can become this really vicious cycle where the anxiety about sleep is the main thing feeding the sleep problem. “Remember, the perpetuating factors are really your behaviors and cognitions,” she said. “Those have the potential to keep the insomnia going even when the stress resolves. It’s these vicious cycles that we want to look out for.” For those who need professional help, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, , is widely considered the gold standard treatment, Mundt said. One key focus is on improving sleep schedules. “We have them track their sleep pattern with a log and then customize their sleep schedule to really regulate their sleep biology so that it gets more consolidated and more consistent,” she said. Another focus of CBT-I is to retrain the brain to see the bed as a welcoming, calming place. “With insomnia, people spend a lot of time awake in bed. They’re frustrated and anxious, and that all becomes associated with the bed, turning it into this really negative place,” Mundt said. “This is where we talk about only going to bed if you’re sleepy and not using your bed for things other than sleep and actually getting out of bed if you’re not sleeping for a while,” she said. “We’re trying to recondition and change those negative associations.” .",

This idea could actually knock your socks on, says behavioral sleep disorders specialist Michelle Drerup. “It sounds counterintuitive, I know, but by wearing socks to bed and warming your feet, you may actually lower your core body temperature and fall asleep faster,” said Drerup, director of the Sleep Disorders Center at Cleveland Clinic. Here’s how that happens. During the day, a typical adult’s core temperature rises to between 97 and 99 degrees Fahrenheit (36.1 C and 37.2 C), with an average of 98.6 F (37 C) — children 10 and younger may run a As night approaches, core temperature begins to drop by one to two degrees, preparing the body for sleep. A process called distal vasodilation helps with cooling  by widening blood vessels in the extremities — primarily the hands and feet — thus increasing heat loss though the skin. As the skin warms, the core of the body cools, which is where those toasty socks come in handy. “By making your feet warmer, you’re opening up blood vessels to help cool down the rest of the body,” Drerup said. “So increasing the blood circulation to your feet results in a lower core temperature.” In fact, a published in 2018 found young men who slept in socks fell asleep nearly eight minutes faster and slept 32 minutes longer than those who didn’t, with fewer awakenings during the night. It’s not just socks. suggest keeping the entire bedroom about 65 F (18.3 C) to keep your core temperature cool during the night. Of course, that can fluctuate, with some requiring a room closer to 60 F (15.6 C) and others preferring a warmer 70 F (21.1 C). Another tip is to take a warm (not hot) shower or bath before bed. The principle is the same, Drerup said. “If I’m slightly increasing my core body temperature a bit just before bedtime, then there’s a bigger drop as it lowers, and that potentially helps with feeling sleepy,” she said. This tip may not work for everyone. In my home, I’m addicted to fuzzy socks and wear them religiously to bed — if my tootsies are the slightest bit chilly, sleep is impossible. My husband, on the other hand, immediately kicks the covers off his feet, preferring what I view as popsicle toes. To each their own, says sleep specialist Jennifer Mundt, an associate professor of family and preventive medicine at the University of Utah who sees patients at the school’s Sleep Wake Center. “If you wear socks to bed and you feel like your feet are too hot, by all means, take your socks off,” Mundt said. “It’s the same idea with room temperature. People can get really hung up — ‘Oh, I heard from this podcast or this book that the bedroom should be this exact temperature.’ “That’s just not really the way it works,” she added. “Just use your own judgment of just what feels comfortable, because our bodies are good at telling us if we’re too warm or we’re too cold.”",

    "content": "Max Genecov is a doctoral candidate in clinical psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, a dad, and a stuffed animal owner. “I’ve always had them growing up, I had a big fantasy life with them (as a child),” he said. “I just think that they’re nice things you have.” He has a plush racoon from his childhood, crochets them when friends or family have babies, and still sometimes hugs a stuffed animal or uses one as a pillow when he sleeps, he said. It might sound unusual, but when you think about it –– is it really? Plush sales grew over the Covid-19 pandemic, and in 2024, 21% of plush toys were sold to adults over 18, according to Juli Lennett, US toys industry adviser at Circana, a market research and technology company in Chicago. Stuffed animals “struck a chord with young adults and adults as a means to entertain, collect, and provide comfort during the pandemic,” she said in an email. Build-A-Bear even has an entire section of its website dedicated to products for grown-ups. A found that more than half of people held on to a childhood stuffed animal, and about 40% said they sleep with a plush toy. “I wonder if people are seeking more comfort in the face of uncertainty,” said Dr. Jade Wu, a sleep psychologist and founder of Thrive Sleep Clinic in Durham, North Carolina. And for people living on their own, it could be nice to have something to cuddle with at night, she added. There is nothing wrong with having a stuffed animal as an adult or using one to sleep better, experts said. In fact, there are a lot of positives to it. As a mental health therapist in Seattle, Dr. Jessica Lamar uses stuffed animals with adults who are working through trauma, she said. They go to Build-A-Bear and make a bear to represent their inner child or a younger version of themselves so they can  heal trauma from childhood, she said. Patients giving the bears the comfort, connection and compassion they might not have gotten enough of as a child can be very helpful, Lamar added. But stuffed animals aren’t just for people working through trauma. Anyone can benefit from the gentleness, softness and self-soothing that a cute, plush object can bring, Genecov said. Lamar agreed, noting that a stuffed animal you’ve had since childhood can provide nostalgia, a connection to family or friends you are far from, and a touchpoint for pleasant memories. “It can be very cozy, relaxing and nice,” Wu said. “There’s no reason why adults can’t have the benefits of  that kids get.” But that is the problem –– stuffed animals are for kids, you might be thinking. “If we think about it from the lens of being like a healthy, balanced adult, I actually think it’s really helpful to say, ‘Hey, I am this adult who’s in college, and I still have this healthy attachment to my childhood,’” Lamar said. “It’s really wonderful to be able to say, ‘This is a part of my child self that I want to stay connected to.’” Maybe there would be an issue if someone became severely distressed or unable to sleep when they were separated from their stuffed animal, Lamar said. It could also be a problem if people used their stuffed animals to avoid other issues, said Dr. Barbara Greenberg, a clinical psychologist in Weston, Connecticut. But both said they haven’t seen that become an issue. In fact, using a stuffed animal to feel better could be good modeling to the kids in your life, Greenberg said. “This is one of the ways to self soothe. We take something like an animal into our bed; it’s comforting,’” she said. “That’s one of the things you have to teach kids when they’re young, how to self-regulate, how to self soothe.” Especially important is to let boys keep their stuffed animals –– they need self-soothing too, Greenberg said. A stuffed animal in your bed at night might be meeting evolutionary needs, Wu said. “We evolved to live in tribes and to have a village,” she said. “We sleep the best when we feel safe, so when we’re feeling vulnerable … then we want that bodily contact. “Social sleeping makes us  feel more safe and sleep better. So, a stuffed animal may be sort of a good alternative to having someone else sleeping in your bed.” Even over the course of a life, it makes sense to need contact when you sleep, Lamar added. The womb is a very safe space; then as babies, humans are swaddled to sleep, she said. “As we get older, that obviously becomes less of a need, but that need is still there,” Lamar said. Some stuffed animals are even weighted to provide a little extra pressure when you snuggle up. “There is some research showing that weighted blankets, at least, can help to calm the mind and body,” Wu said.  “I could definitely see a weight of stuffed animals serving a similar function as a weighted blanket in that way.” If nothing else, stuffed animals can help with better sleep by providing a signal to the brain that it is time to wind down, Wu added. “The feeling of it, the smell of it, the sight of it, can be associated with sleep, and so helps to signal that you know sleep is coming,” she said. However you use your favorite stuffed animal –– displayed on a shelf, tucked in a closet or ready for you in bed at night –– it is great if it can be a way to get better sleep, Greenberg said. “If it helps you with stress, it’s a much better alternative than taking a tranquilizer or drinking a glass of wine. It hurts nobody,” she said. .",

    "content": "Older women who stayed on a reduced-calorie Mediterranean diet, walked and did resistance training for three years improved their bone density, especially in their lower backs, a new study found. “A reduced-energy Mediterranean diet involves participants consuming a modified version of the traditional Mediterranean diet with approximately 30% fewer calories than their usual intake,” said coauthor Jesús Francisco García-Gavilán, a senior biostatistician at the University Rovira i Virgili in Tarragona, Spain. Women in the study, who ranged in age from 55 to 75, were also able to prevent bone deterioration that typically occurs during weight loss, according to the research published Tuesday in the journal “Previous research has indicated that losing weight, particularly through diet alone, can lead to a reduction in bone density, which poses risks for older adults. Additionally, exercising alone does not always prevent this issue,” García-Gavilán said in an email. “What is new in this study is the finding that combining a well-balanced, reduced-calorie Mediterranean diet with physical activity can prevent bone loss in older women, even while they are losing weight,” he said. “This emphasizes that the type of diet is important during weight loss, not just the calorie intake.” The results of the study are not that surprising, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. “When you practice the lifestyle that human beings were always meant to live, which is moving a lot and eating predominantly simple, plant-based foods, all sorts of systems get better, including bone density,” said Freeman, who was not involved in the new research. The new study is part of the , a randomized clinical trial on lifestyle interventions conducted in 23 medical centers and hospitals in Spain. The trial included 924 older adults with who were overweight or had obesity. Half were randomized to eating a Mediterranean diet with no restrictions on calories and no requirement to exercise. The other half were encouraged to walk for a minimum of 45 minutes per day six days per week and to do strength, flexibility and balance exercises three days per week. Their diet was cut to about 30% fewer calories than they typically consumed and only from a Mediterranean-style eating plan. Women in this group saw significantly stronger bones at one year and at three years into the study. “While previous results from the PREDIMED-Plus trial highlighted benefits for maintaining lean mass and losing weight, this is the first publication to demonstrate that these lifestyle changes can also help preserve bone density, especially in older women,” García-Gavilán said. The award-winning features simple, plant-based cooking, with much of each meal focused on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds, with a few nuts and a heavy emphasis on . Fats other than olive oil, such as butter, are consumed rarely, if at all, and sugar and refined foods are avoided. is used sparingly, often only to flavor a dish. Eating healthy, oily fish, which are packed with omega-3 fatty acids, is encouraged, while eggs, dairy and poultry are eaten in much smaller portions than in the traditional Western diet. Eating the Mediterranean way has been linked to reductions in the risk for , , , , and . Adherence to the diet can also lead to a , and . But exactly why would the meal plan help preserve bone? “The Mediterranean diet is rich in nutrients that promote bone health,” García-Gavilán said. “Nuts and dairy products provide essential calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D. Healthy fats, such as those found in olive oil, have been shown to reduce inflammation.” Antioxidants such as vitamin C from fruits and vegetables may help protect and support bone cells, García-Gavilán added, while other important vitamins, like vitamin K found in vegetables such as spinach, play a role in bone formation. “Together, these nutrients can lower the risk of bone loss and support bone maintenance, especially as we age,” García-Gavilán said. “Understanding this nutritional context is crucial for maintaining our long-term quality of life.”",

    "content": "Americans are in the middle of a love-affair with protein. A stroll through almost any major supermarket — where food labels tout grams of protein — bears witness to the trend. And why shouldn’t we be? Along with carbohydrates and fat, protein is that make up our diet. Furthermore, it is the only macronutrient that supplies us with amino acids, making it essential for survival. have a hand in , such as building and preserving muscle, making hormones and neurotransmitters, boosting the immune system, even maintaining healthy skin, hair and nails. And while our bodies can make some of the needed amino acids, it can’t make them all. Enter dietary protein. What is the optimal amount you should be getting? The answer is that it’s complicated. The US (RDA) of protein for adults 18 and older is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight (or 0.36 grams per pound) per day, which translates to about 54 grams of protein for a 150-pound person, or 72 grams for someone weighing 200 pounds. by the US Department of Agriculture and the US Department of Health and Human Services, the RDA represents the minimum amount of protein that must be eaten by a relatively sedentary person to meet the basic needs of their body. There’s also something called the acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR), which was developed by the to establish ranges for carbohydrates, fat and protein that are associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases. Those guidelines, which put intake within the context of , recommend protein make up between of the calories in an adult’s diet. (The an adult should be getting depends on characteristics such as age, sex, weight and activity level.) All that is to say, there is no exact number for the amount of protein that you should be getting. If you look at , most people in the United States are getting more than enough; if you listen to some influencers, you are not getting enough. “I was in L.A., and I did some interviews there, and nine out of 10 people I asked, ‘What did you have for breakfast?’ — it was raw eggs or protein bars or protein smoothies. It was amazing,” Dr. Tim Spector told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently, on his podcast Chasing Life. Spector is a genetic epidemiologist and researcher at King’s College London and founder of one of the world’s largest twins registries, TWINS UK. “They’ve been sort of brainwashed into thinking that they have to move on to protein because they’re somehow deficient and they’re not going to be lean and have a six-pack and be running marathons (if they don’t),” he said. Spector is also author of several best-selling books including “ .” (He’s also a co-founder of ZOE, a personalized nutrition app). Spector has nothing at all against protein per se. “In general, protein is pretty good, particularly if it’s plant protein — but, nothing wrong with meat protein in moderation. But it’s what it replaces,” he said. “We need to start thinking much more holistically.” “Studies have shown that Americans have more than enough protein,” he added. “There might be a few exceptions out there, but most people are already on twice the amount, and ” Spector said certain groups may require a bit more protein: older adults, people going through or recovering from serious illness, those with restrictive diets and people who are “training incredibly hard.” But the rest of us — in the United States, at least — do just fine. (Many people do not .) If you find that you need it, how can you get some additional high-quality protein into your diet — while benefiting from other important nutrients and without relying on highly processed sweetened powders and snack bars? Here are Spector’s top five tips. “They come in many forms — black, pinto, broad, kidney, and more — but they never get the attention they deserve,”  said Spector via email. “They’re all good sources of healthy plant protein,” he noted. Beans are also loaded with other good-for-you nutrients. “Importantly, they also contain fiber (a nutrient that most people really are deficient in), and other healthy plant compounds, like polyphenols,” he said. Load up on the three-bean salad or bean burrito. Those , come in a wide variety and, if you buy them dried, are extremely shelf-stable. Hearty and versatile, whole grains — such as barley, brown rice, buckwheat, bulgur, corn, millet, oats, quinoa, rye and whole wheat — contain the entire grain kernel, including the bran, germ and endosperm. “Whole grains are good for a wide range of reasons,” said Spector via email. “They are a great source of fiber and include a wide range of micronutrients. They’re also much higher in protein than people expect. For instance, oats have 11g of protein per 100g compared with 13g per 100g for eggs.” “Regularly consuming whole grains is associated with a reduced risk of many health conditions, such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes,” he noted. An easy way to get more in your diet? “Swap products that contain highly refined grains — like white rice, pasta, and bread — for whole grain versions, such as brown rice, wholewheat pasta, and wholewheat bread,” he said. Many of us love a good burger or steak, but eating too much of a good thing is not so good for you. “It’s true that meat is a great source of protein,” Spector said. “However, for your health and the health of the planet, it’s best to reduce your meat intake, particularly red and processed meat.” “Some people worry that most plants are not complete proteins, so they might be missing out on specific amino acids,” he noted. “But each plant source of protein has a unique amino acid profile. By consuming a wide variety of plants, you will naturally take in all the amino acids you need.” And  don’t panic. Nobody is saying you have to cut out meat entirely. “Consider replacing half of the meat in your stews, chilis, or soups with mixed lentils and beans, tofu, or tempeh, or have one or two vegetarian or pescetarian days each week,” he said. When you do eat meat, Spector added, “try to choose good quality products and opt for leaner cuts.” “Many people avoid nuts and seeds because they’re relatively high in fat,” Spector said. “Although this is true, they contain healthy unsaturated fats, like monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which support good health.” It may come as no surprise to find “they’re also a good source of healthy plant protein and a wide range of vitamins and minerals,” he said. If you are not a fan of munching on straight-up nuts or seeds, Spector said you can sprinkle them on most dishes “savory or sweet — to provide extra texture and flavor.” Consider adding them to your yogurt parfait, salad or stew. Peanut butter is also a good choice, he said, “but find a product with as few ingredients as possible, and no added sugar or salt.” “Soy is one of the few complete proteins in the plant world,” Spector said. “It’s also incredibly versatile and can easily be incorporated into meals. Consider adding tofu, tempeh or edamame to the dishes you already love.” As an added bonus, he said, “soy products contain fiber and are rich in vitamins and minerals.” When it comes to protein, Spector said most people should seek out quality over quantity. “Focus on plants, and ignore products that claim to be high in protein, because they’re probably also high in salt, sugar, and other additives your body doesn’t need,” he said. .

    "content": ". says she has moved away from her yearslong strict Paleo diet and is venturing back into carbs and cheese. Speaking on released Tuesday, the 52-year-old actress and founder of lifestyle brand Goop said “longer-term inflammation and health stuff” was the reason she and her husband, Brad Falchuk, “became Paleo a few years ago.” She had previously her podcast listeners that she had genes , raising her risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, and “I have to be really careful not to have inflammation in my brain.” Under the , people follow a meal plan intended to be similar to that of hunters and gatherers who lived during the Paleolithic era, between 2.6 million and 10,000 years ago. They eat lots of fruits, vegetables, nuts, lean meats and fish, while cutting out dairy products, sugar, grains, legumes and highly processed foods. The restrictions of eating Paleo have started to rankle with Paltrow, however. “I’m a little sick of it if I’m honest,” she continued. “I’m getting back into eating some sourdough bread and some cheese. There, I said it. A little pasta. After being strict with it for so long.” Nevertheless, she maintained that “it’s a good, sort of, template, right? Eating foods that are kind of as whole and fresh as possible.” “It is great to hear that Gwyneth is adding back into her very restrictive diet. This is definitely a good thing,” Priya Tew, a specialist dietitian and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, told CNN on Friday. “It sounds like Gwyneth is moving towards a more balanced and nutritious diet. Considering her realm of influence it is good to hear that she is finding this of benefit,” she added. “Nutrition research shows us that cutting out whole food groups is not good for our overall health. We need diversity and variety to help us meet all our nutritional needs, to bring taste into out diets and prevent boredom and to also bring pleasure!” Tew continued. The Paleo diet is not the first strict eating regimen that Paltrow has tried. She told podcast listeners that her father was diagnosed with throat cancer when she was around the age of 26, and it was “at that time that I started wondering, really through trying to see if there was anything we could do to help my father, if there was any kind of intersection between wellness and food.” “I went into hardcore macrobiotics for a certain time,” she added. “That was an interesting chapter, where I got kind of obsessed with eating very, very healthily. I think that was – I was really trying to heal my dad by proxy and he just didn’t really want anything to do with it.” People on a macrobiotic diet aim to avoid foods that contain toxins, with many eating only vegan foods, according to the charity Cancer Research UK’s . The diet also involves strict rules, such as only eating when hungry, only drinking when thirsty, not having any vitamin or mineral supplements, and avoiding cooking with electricity or using a microwave oven. It was developed in the 1920s by Japanese philosopher George Ohsawa, who believed the diet could help us live in harmony with nature and cure cancer and other serious illnesses, according to the charity. However, there is no scientific evidence that supports the idea that this diet can prevent or cure cancer. “As a dietitian I would not agree that there is enough evidence to prove a macrobiotic diet is a cure for throat cancer or that a Paleo diet is beneficial, either,” said Tew. “Carbohydrates are a vital part of our diets, providing fibre, B vitamins and energy. They are also key for our gut microbiome and also bring taste and enjoyment to meals!” she added. Goop, which Paltrow founded in 2008, has faced criticism over the years from various quarters. In 2018, prosecutors in California hit it with totaling $145,000 for “unsubstantiated claims” relating to vaginal eggs and an essential oil-like product.",

    "content": "Peek inside Jackie Akerberg’s refrigerator and you’ll see a rainbow-hued array of fresh fruits and vegetables, all washed, dried and transferred to glass food storage containers. They’re about to get featured in the bountiful bowls and salads that have become her signature on her account. But      the real MVP of this recipe developer’s      kitchen is actually the palest thing you’ll find in that fridge: tofu. Protein is what people ask about when they learn Akerberg doesn’t eat any animal products. (She’s been vegan since October 2019 but prefers the more inclusive term “plant-based.”) You won’t get enough if your go-to vegan food sources are Doritos and Oreos, she noted. But if you “strip things down to the basics and focus on  whole foods, including my favorite ingredient, tofu, it’s definitely  possible,” said Akerberg,      author of “ ”  published in 2023. “I typically start every morning with a smoothie made with soy milk, spinach, banana and a plant-based protein powder that blends pea and rice protein,” Akerberg said. “I’m getting 45 grams of protein before the sun comes up.” For other meals and snacks, Akerberg mixes in staples like , lentils, nuts, seeds and tempeh. All of these choices add up to around she confirmed. That’s right on par with a common mark promoted during the . The of protein for adults is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight per day, or 0.36 grams per pound. For reference, a 150-pound (68-kilogram) person would require 54 grams of protein daily to meet that mark. Nearly all men hit the protein goal or go over, and less than 8% of women fall short, according to . One of the  best and most versatile ways Akerberg has found to get her fill of the macronutrient is with tofu. Also known as  bean curd, this soybean-based food contains      all the essential amino acids, or protein  building blocks, that the body can’t make itself. The inclusion of all those amino acids means that tofu is what dietitians sometimes refer to as a “ ,” alongside animal products like eggs, meat and dairy. Tofu is made by curdling fresh soy milk, compressing it into a block, and allowing it to cool, similar to how cheese is made from cow’s milk. Akerberg is on a mission to change tofu’s reputation for being bland, boring or spongy —and convince others that it’s a blank slate solution to add more protein to their meals, too. You need not be vegan      to enjoy it, either: “I don’t think a diet needs to be black and white. I’m choosing to eat plant-based because it makes my body feel amazing, and I love the flavor of these foods. But if you just want to eat one plant-based meal a      week or also      add tofu to the menu on a day that includes eggs, beef or chicken, that’s also totally cool,” Akerberg said. Here are her four easy tips to      prepare top-notch tofu recipes. “Many people think tofu is very spongy, soft or mushy, or they just don’t love the texture,” Akerberg said. “I get it, and if you choose firm or extra-firm tofu, you’re going to want to press it (between two plates with a heavy can or bottle on top) for about 30 minutes to remove excess water and create a meatier texture.” However, if you prefer to skip that pressing step, and especially if you’re new to tofu, “buy high-protein, extra-firm tofu. It eliminates the pressing; it has the meatiest texture; and has the nuttiest taste.” The quickest and easiest way to cook tofu doesn’t even require you to preheat your oven or grill, Akerberg explained. To a nonstick skillet coated in cooking spray or a thin layer of oil, add cubes, slabs, triangles or sticks of pressed firm or extra-firm tofu or as-is high-protein tofu. Spread the pieces out in a single layer and sear over medium-low heat for about four minutes per side, or until the surface is golden and releases from the pan easily. Cook for slightly less time on the other side, and you’ll be treated to tofu “that almost tastes like it’s been deep-fried but hasn’t. Toss it in whatever seasoning, sauce or dressing you want afterward, and it’s amazing.” “Tofu has a neutral, slightly nutty taste, so it takes on any flavor of sauce or seasoning you pair it with,” Akerberg said. “Many cooks love to marinate tofu, which works great. But if you’re pan-searing or baking tofu, it doesn’t even need a marinade.” She suggested a far quicker and easier alternative: Toss cubes of firm tofu with coconut aminos (a low-sodium, soy sauce-like condiment made from the fermented sap of coconut flowers), then sprinkle them with spices and bake or sear. You’ll see this method come to life in the Tofu Shawarma Bowl recipe below. “The coconut aminos help the seasonings stick, and it has slight sweetness and deep umami flavor. It does magical things with tofu, because tofu is such a blank slate,” Akerberg said. On the seasoning side, Akerberg is wild about blackening seasoning, cumin, paprika, garlic powder and onion powder. Nutritional yeast, a high-protein vegan product solid in flakes or powders and made from deactivated baking yeast, tastes savory and cheesy — and is the key ingredient to transform tofu into a substitute. You also can get saucy after cooking tofu, too, she said. Try drizzling or coating cubes of tofu in your favorite peanut sauce, barbecue sauce or to recreate the flavors of familiar dishes you dig. Firm tofu of all kinds is ideal when you’re seeking something sturdy enough to stand up to searing, stir-frying, scrambling, baking or grilling, Akerberg said. But don’t pass by its cousin: silken tofu. “Silken tofu is unpressed and has a higher water content than firm tofu. The texture is very similar to a thick yogurt, custard or pudding. Because of that, it’s phenomenal for desserts and smoothies,” Akerberg explained. Her favorite use is in ; a dessert that completely disguises the tofu in a whipped, cocoa-flavored cloud. Silken tofu also shines in savory sauces and soups like and . “It’s a terrific swap for those who are in their cottage cheese or Greek yogurt era,” Akerberg said, hinting at the fact that it can often step in as a swap for those trendy dairy products. Allergic or sensitive to soy? Tofu isn’t off the table. Look for a soy-free tofu made with fava beans, pumpkin seeds, chickpeas or almonds, Akerberg advised. Serves 4 15 minutes 40 minutes Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Add cubed tofu to a bowl and drizzle with coconut aminos and spices. Toss to combine. Spread on the baking sheet and bake for 20 to 25 minutes until crispy. Give the bowl a quick rinse and dry, and add the cucumber, onion, avocado, cherry tomatoes, parsley, red wine vinegar and lemon juice. Stir to combine and season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide the mixed greens among four serving bowls. Top with couscous, cucumber salad, hummus and crispy tofu. In a small bowl, mix dressing ingredients and drizzle over bowls.",

    "content": "As you add more ultraprocessed foods to your diet, your risk of a premature death from any cause rises, according to a new meta-analysis of research involving more than 240,000 people. “We looked at the risk of a person dying from eating more ultraprocessed foods between the ages of 30 and 69, a time when it would be premature to die,” said study coauthor Carlos Augusto Monteiro, emeritus professor of nutrition and public health in the School of Public Health at Brazil’s University of São Paulo. “We found that for each 10% increase in total calories from ultraprocessed foods, the risk of dying prematurely rose by nearly 3%,” said Monteiro, who coined the term “ultraprocessed” in 2009 when he developed , a system of classifying foods into four groups by their level of processing. Group one of the NOVA system is unprocessed or minimally processed foods in their natural state, such as fruits, vegetables, meat, milk and eggs. Group two includes culinary ingredients such as salt, herbs and oils. Group three consists of processed foods that combine groups one and two — canned goods and frozen vegetables are examples. Group four includes ultraprocessed foods. By Monteiro’s definition, ultraprocessed foods contain little to no whole food. Instead, they are manufactured from “chemically manipulated cheap ingredients” and often use “synthetic additives to make them edible, palatable and habit-forming.” “No reason exists to believe that humans can fully adapt to these products,” Monteiro cowrote in a .  “The body may react to them as useless or harmful, so its systems may become impaired or damaged, depending on their vulnerability and the amount of ultra-processed food consumed.” The new study is misleading and will lead to consumer confusion, said Sarah Gallo, senior vice president of product policy for the Consumer Brands Association, which represents the food industry. “Demonizing convenient, affordable and shelf ready food and beverage products could limit access to and cause avoidance of nutrient dense foods,” Gallo said in an email, “resulting in decreased diet quality, increased risk of food-borne illness and exacerbated health disparities.” This study is not the first to find an association between negative health outcomes and small increases in ultraprocessed food. A found “strong” evidence that people who ate more ultraprocessed food had a 50% higher risk of cardiovascular disease-related death and common mental disorders. Higher intake of ultraprocessed foods might also increase the risk of anxiety by up to 53%, obesity by 55%, sleep disorders by 41%, development of type 2 diabetes by 40% and the risk of depression or an early death from any cause by 20%. Researchers in the February study defined a higher intake as one serving or about 10% more ultraprocessed foods per day. A May 2024 study found that adding just 10% of ultraprocessed food to an otherwise healthy diet may also increase the risk of while 2023 research determined that including 10% more ultraprocessed foods was linked to a greater chance of of the upper digestive tract. It’s estimated that as much as is ultraprocessed. “Two-thirds of the calories children consume in the US are ultraprocessed, while about 60% of adult diets are ultraprocessed,” Fang Fang Zhang, associate professor and chair of the division of nutrition epidemiology and data science at Tufts University in Boston, told CNN . Zhang was not involved in the new research. The latest study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, took an additional step by estimating how many deaths might be prevented in eight countries with low, medium and high consumption of ultraprocessed foods. “Premature preventable deaths due to the consumption of UPFs can vary from 4% in countries with lower UPF consumption to almost 14% in countries with the highest UPF consumption,” lead study author Eduardo Augusto Fernandes Nilson, a researcher at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Rio de Janeiro, said in a statement. However, it’s important to note that the study was unable to determine if the deaths were “caused by UPF consumption. The methods of this study simply cannot determine this,” said nutrition scientist Nerys Astbury, an associate professor of diet and obesity at the UK’s University of Oxford, in a statement. He was not involved in the study. The United States has the highest level of ultraprocessed food consumption in the world — nearly 55% of the average American’s diet, according to the study. Researchers estimated reducing the use of those ultraprocessed foods to zero would have prevented over 124,000 deaths in the US in 2017. In countries where consumption of ultraprocessed foods is low, such as Colombia (15% of the diet) and Brazil (17.4%), reducing the use to zero would have prevented nearly 3,000 deaths in the former country in 2015 and 25,000 deaths in the latter in 2017, according to the study. “The authors set the theoretical minimal risk level to be 0. This implies a scenario where all UPFs are eliminated, which is highly unrealistic and nearly impossible in our current society,” Zhang said in an email. “As a result, the estimated burden of pre-mature death due to UPFs could be overestimated.” Stephen Burgess, a statistician in the MRC Biostatistics Unit at the UK’s University of Cambridge, said that while the study cannot prove the consumption of ultraprocessed foods is harmful, “it does provide evidence linking consumption with poorer health outcomes.” “It is possible that the true causal risk factor is not ultraprocessed foods, but a related risk factor such as better physical fitness — and ultraprocessed foods is simply an innocent bystander,” said Burgess, who was not involved in the study, in a statement. “But, when we see these associations replicated across many countries and cultures, it raises suspicion that ultraprocessed foods may be more than a bystander.”",

    "content": "A group of experts who advise the US Food and Drug Administration on its vaccine decisions voted unanimously Thursday to make a broad recommendation about which lineage of the coronavirus should be included in this year’s Covid-19 vaccines, giving the agency latitude to keep the current shots or update its formulas to more closely match circulating viruses. Several of the committee members asked at Thursday’s meeting about the FDA’s new vaccine approval . Some expressed concern that changing the strain targeted in this year’s vaccine might decrease access to the shots in the fall, since the updated version would require new FDA approval. Capt. Sarah Meyer, a pediatrician who directs the Immunization Safety Office at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, posed it as the first question of the meeting. “I did have a question on how the new regulatory framework put forward this week might affect aspects related to selecting the strain. For example, if a different strain was selected for this season, would that require additional clinical trials, etc.?” she asked. “I think that’s a little off-topic,” said Dr. Jerry Weir, a longtime FDA staffer who is director of the Division of Viral Products within the agency’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “I think for today, we focus mainly on what we think in this committee should be in the vaccine, and then the rest of it, we’ll work on that later.” Under the new framework, the agency says, it will accept the same kind of study data it has been using to approve annual flu shots and updated Covid-19 vaccines, but only for certain groups: those 65 and older and people with underlying medical conditions that put them at higher risk of severe illness. In order to approve Covid-19 vaccines for healthy younger adults and children, however, the agency now wants to see placebo-controlled clinical trials, which take longer and are expensive to run. Even if vaccine manufacturers choose to run those studies, it’s unlikely that the research could be conducted in time for them to have shots ready for everyone 6 months and older by the fall. “Is there a possibility that if we choose a different vaccine, [there are] actually going to be different regulatory measures that are taken that would delay the vaccine getting to the market?” asked committee member Dr. Stanley Perlman, a microbiologist and immunologist at the University of Iowa. FDA representatives attending the meeting had no firm answers about whether changing the targeted coronavirus strain might put the shots out of reach for some groups this fall. “I think that the goal today is to figure out what the selection of the strain is, but we don’t anticipate and our goal is not to impact the timely availability of vaccines,” said Dr. David Kaslow, director of the FDA’s Office of Vaccines Research and Review. The voting members of the FDA’s Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee agreed that next respiratory season’s shots should target the JN.1 family of viruses that swept the globe last year, although they stopped short of making a specific recommendation. The JN.1 branch of the Omicron family tree was a big shift from the viruses that came before, and it quickly replaced the XBB lineage viruses that had been circulating. It has sprouted its own descendants, which are now the predominant variants. Although JN.1 and its offshoot KP.2 – the sublineage used to make the Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines in the US last year – are no longer circulating, several more viruses derived from them continue to drive Covid-19 transmission. They’re all part of the JN.1 family, and so vaccines based on that virus are still protective. Last week, the World Health Organization said that single-strain inoculations based on JN.1 or KP.2 remain “appropriate” choices. The FDA advisory committee heard evidence from vaccine manufacturers that vaccination with JN.1-or KP.2-based shots continues to boost antibodies to protective levels, even against newer viruses with slightly different mutations. But manufacturers also presented data showing that updated shots based on a newer member of the JN.1 family – LP.8.1, which is currently the variant in the US – could boost antibodies even more robustly. “We need to stay ahead of this virus, as opposed to behind it,” said committee member Dr. Hayley Gans, a pediatrician at Stanford, who said she favored updating the vaccine formula for the fall to LP.8.1. “I think what we need to do is to have the most effective vaccine, not one that predicts that it would be less effective down the line.” Committee member Dr. Eric Rubin, a professor of immunology and infectious disease at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, agreed. “The data suggest that there are not enormous differences right now, but we’re trying to pick an antigen for the future, and not an antigen for now.” Kaslow said the FDA would decide on the specific composition of the 2025-26 vaccine shortly so manufacturers could have the shots ready in time for the fall.",

    "title": "\n      Given Biden’s diagnosis, what a urologist wants you to know about prostate screening\n    ",

    "content": "When I learned that former President Joe Biden had not undergone prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening since 2014—and was later diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer—I knew there would be renewed interest and debate about prostate cancer screening guidelines. As a urologist, I regularly discuss the complexities surrounding PSA testing with my patients. The PSA test remains valuable for early detection, but it continues to generate controversy due to its limitations. Here’s what you should know about PSA screening, why medical guidelines vary and why individualized approaches are essential. Prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, is a protein produced by the prostate. The PSA blood test measures this protein to help screen for prostate cancer. Typically, a PSA level above 4 on lab results is flagged as “abnormal,” prompting further evaluation. However, even PSA numbers below 4 can be concerning if they’re rapidly increasing. That’s why PSA tests are done annually: to monitor trends over time. Elevated PSA levels don’t always mean cancer. Noncancerous conditions like an enlarged prostate, prostatitis (inflammation), recent ejaculation, stress or even strenuous activity can temporarily raise PSA. Ultimately, the PSA level is just a starting point for a deeper investigation (or conversation). Additionally, not all prostate cancers cause elevated PSA levels. Some aggressive cancers may produce normal PSA results. Ultimately, the PSA level is a starting point for further evaluation and deeper conversations with your doctor. The controversy around PSA testing isn’t really about the test itself, but about how its results are interpreted and acted upon. Before 2012, PSA screening was routinely recommended for all men over age 50. I completed my urology training that same year, witnessing firsthand how dramatically the screening landscape changed almost overnight. In 2012, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against routine PSA screening due to concerns of “overdiagnosis.” The worry was that screening could detect slow-growing cancers that may never cause harm but still result in unnecessary biopsies, anxiety, and treatments—some of which caused more harm than good. The recommendation led doctors to scale back, causing routine PSA testing to decline sharply. However, by 2018, new research and rising concerns about aggressive prostate cancers led the USPSTF to revise their recommendations again, advising men aged 55 to 69 to engage in shared decision-making with their providers. This current stance emphasizes personalized discussions between patients and doctors, acknowledging that there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to PSA testing. According to their website, the USPSTF is now working on another update, so we can expect further adjustments in the near future. As someone who experienced this shift firsthand early in my career, I deeply appreciate how critical shared decision-making and patient involvement are in navigating these complex screening choices. These ongoing changes in recommendations have also reinforced the importance for me as a physician to stay informed, continuously adapting my practice as new research and technologies emerge. Several organizations provide prostate cancer screening guidelines, including the USPSTF, the American Cancer Society and the American Urological Association (AUA). Each offers slightly different recommendations for both patients and health care providers. The USPSTF generally focuses on minimizing potential harm from overtreatment, while the AUA provides detailed, individualized recommendations based on clinical factors and risk profiles. Even after practicing urology for more than a decade, I still sometimes find it challenging to navigate these subtle differences in guidelines. Although I primarily follow the AUA guidelines—my overarching professional body—I’ve established a balanced approach that feels comfortable for me and, I believe, best serves my patients’ interests. I start PSA testing at age 40 for men at higher risk, such as African Americans or those with a first-degree family member who has prostate cancer. For most patients, I typically initiate annual PSA screening at age 50. It’s important to know that primary care doctors perform most prostate cancer screenings. Depending on their training, clinical judgment and professional guidelines, their approach may differ slightly from my take as a urologist. This highlights the importance of clear communication among you the patient, your primary care provider and your specialists. Only through these conversations can we create personalized screening strategies that align with your health goals. President Biden’s case raises a question: Could earlier PSA screening have detected his cancer sooner, at a more treatable stage? We will never know for certain. According to current guidelines, stopping screening in one’s 70s is considered appropriate. Perhaps there was a shared decision to stop testing. From a guideline perspective, nothing was necessarily done incorrectly. Still, Biden’s diagnosis highlights the potential consequences of discontinuing prostate screening for an otherwise healthy older adult. Men in the United States now have an average life expectancy of approximately 76 years, with many living healthy, active lives well into their 80s and beyond. Older guidelines based on shorter lifespans now need updating to reflect today’s longer, healthier lives. I believe that decisions about prostate screening in older adults should thus focus more on individual health status rather than chronological age alone. Changing guidelines based on longer life expectancy will require thorough research and evidence-based data. Consequently, updates to recommendations will take time. What you can do in the meantime is be proactive in your conversations with your doctors about not just prostate cancer screenings but all cancer screenings. Prostate cancer isn’t the only medical condition subject to evolving guidelines. Screening recommendations for colorectal and breast cancers have also changed recently. Colon cancer screening now generally starts at age 45 instead of 50 due to rising cases among younger adults. Breast cancer guidelines continue to vary among organizations, but the USPSTF updated its recommendation last year to say that most women should start getting mammograms earlier. These frequent shifts reflect ongoing research and the importance of personalized, informed conversations between patients and health care providers. Historically, an elevated PSA test led directly to a prostate biopsy, potentially causing unnecessary anxiety and sometimes overtreatment. Today, however, we have more advanced PSA-based tests that help better identify significant prostate cancers. Advanced imaging, like prostate MRI, allows us to pinpoint suspicious areas before performing a biopsy, increasing accuracy and decreasing unnecessary procedures. Biopsy techniques have also improved, some shifting from traditional transrectal biopsies to transperineal methods, reducing infection risks. Treatments have similarly evolved, emphasizing active surveillance of low-risk cancers and minimally invasive focal therapies. These advancements have significantly reduced side effects and improved quality of life, even among older patients. In my office, I frequently discuss PSA screening with patients who are over 70. If a patient remains active and healthy and we anticipate good life expectancy, I generally recommend that we continue regular PSA tests. However, the final decision always belongs to the patient, after we carefully weigh the pros and cons together. If your doctor hasn’t initiated this conversation yet, it’s important for you to bring it up. And remember, regardless of age, promptly inform your health care provider about any new urinary symptoms or health concerns. Staying proactive gives you the best chance to maintain good health this year and next.",

    "content": "To prep for a good night’s sleep, start at breakfast. What you eat throughout the day could affect your quality of sleep at night. Adding foods with the right nutrients could help you get to sleep, stay asleep and wake up more refreshed, according to Dr. Marie-Pierre St-Onge, the director of the Center of Excellence for Sleep and Circadian Research at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. In “ : 75 Recipes and a 28-Day Meal Plan That Unlock the Food-Sleep Connection,” St-Onge presents research linking certain foods with the production of melatonin — and better rest. Melatonin is a hormone that regulates sleep and wake cycles. But the production of melatonin relies on tryptophan, an amino acid that people need to get from nutrients because the body can’t produce them, said St-Onge, who is also a professor of nutritional medicine at Columbia University. While some ingredients in particular can help provide tryptophan or encourage melatonin production, just eating a handful of nuts right before bed isn’t going to do the trick, said Dr. Erica Jansen, assistant professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. The book is a good representation of the current science around sleep and food, which shows that the best approach to eating for better sleep focuses on what you eat throughout the day rather than prioritizing one food for a quick fix, she said. “That’s really what I see in my research as well –– that it’s a whole approach to eating,” Jansen said. The research suggests that overall, having a balanced, whole-food diet is helpful, St-Onge said. She recommends focusing on a diet heavy in plants (like fruits and vegetables) but also high in whole grains, fiber and protein sources that are lower in saturated fats. Such foods include legumes such as chickpeas, lentils, tofu, nuts, seeds and beans, which are all good sources of tryptophan, according to the book. When choosing carbohydrates, look for fiber-rich options, and avoid highly processed carbs such as cakes, cookies and crackers, St-Onge wrote. Need more guidance? Eating a , which is higher in fats from fish and olive oil, was associated with a lower risk of insomnia and more time spent sleeping, according to a by St-Onge and her coauthors. Other micronutrients also help support your body’s response to tryptophan and melatonin. Add zinc to your diet with ingredients like almonds, oysters and wheat bran; magnesium with chia seeds, cashews and yogurt; vitamin B with bananas, chickpeas and tuna; and folate with broccoli, lentils and spinach, according to St-Onge’s book. It isn’t a matter of cutting everything that isn’t sleep-promoting out of your diet but rather working in more of sleep-promoting foods as you can, Jansen said. “If you want to eat something that’s really not sleep-promoting, it’s not a big problem,” she said. “It’s not a very prescriptive diet.” Still, it might not be a good idea to eat something sugary, spicy or caffeinated before bed, Jansen said. Focus on adding nutrients that promote sleep instead of restricting foods that don’t. Can’t you just get melatonin or the nutrients that promote it from supplements? Not ideally, St-Onge said. Supplements don’t always provide the right dosage or optimal form of a nutrient, she said. In many cases, nutrients work best paired together, whereas supplements often deliver the nutrient by itself. “Getting nutrients from a balanced diet is generally healthier and safer than supplements,” St-Onge wrote. “Plus, absorbing nutrients from foods is more efficient than extracting them from supplements.” Though people who are already eating a nutrient-dense diet can do more to optimize their sleep, the ones who will likely benefit most are people who have poor diets, Jansen said. If you want to add more whole foods with sleep-promoting nutrients into your day, dietitian Alexandra Babcock recommends starting with one meal, particularly one that needs more inspiration. For some people, that’s breakfast. You can add one serving of fruit, vegetables or beans to your morning meal, Babcock said. She loves eating savory oatmeal with a poached egg and black beans. If you want to add more whole foods to your lunch, a salad with chickpeas is a good option, according to Babcock, who owns Nutrition Innovations in Austin, Texas. Chickpeas don’t have to be boring, Babcock added. “They can have flavor. They can be toasted and roasted in spices.” Small changes geared toward a healthier lifestyle often build on one another: Adjusting one meal could lead to more changes, which could motivate you to get more active — and, of course, to better sleep. Lifestyle changes can help you get better sleep, but that might not be enough for people who have insomnia, Jansen said. “It does have to be kind of like a holistic approach,” she said. “For someone who has really significant sleep disorder, their sleep disorder really should be addressed by a physician at the same time that they’re improving their diets.”",

    "content": ". Archaeologists have uncovered a key component of a mysterious artifact at Sutton Hoo, a National Trust site in Suffolk, England, famous for the seventh century discovered in a mound between 1938 and 1939. The fragments of the have fascinated researchers since a tractor harrow accidentally unearthed the pieces in 1986. Researchers have long questioned the purpose of the artifact, which depicts a North African hunting scene, complete with warriors, a range of weaponry, lions and a hunting dog. Experts believe the bucket came from the Byzantine Empire and was crafted in Antioch, located in modern-day Turkey, before finding its way to the eastern coast of Britain a century later. Excavations in 2012 contributed more pieces to the object, called the Bromeswell bucket. But the entire base of the vessel has proved as elusive as the reasons why it’s present at an Anglo-Saxon site. Now, the Bromeswell puzzle is a little more complete. New excavations last summer unearthed a block of dirt containing pieces of the bucket. A careful analysis revealed the entire base, which includes embellishments that complete feet, paws, shields of figures, as well as the missing face of one of the warriors. The team also uncovered the bucket’s surprising contents — cremated animal and human remains — which shed more light on why the vessel was buried. Alongside the burnt bones, researchers found an unexpectedly intact comb that may contain DNA evidence of the person, likely of high status, who was laid to rest more than a thousand years ago. The dirt block went through CT scans and X-rays at the University of Bradford before being sent to the York Archaeological Trust for a deeper analysis in November. A research team with experience in studying human bones, organic remains and conservation meticulously removed soil inside the bucket, analyzing each fragment as it slowly appeared. The careful approach uncovered cremated human bones, which included parts of an ankle bone and a skull vault, or the protective upper part of the skull, according to a release from the . The researchers also found remnants of animal bone, and an initial analysis suggests the pieces came from something larger than a pig. The team noted that horses were often part of early Anglo-Saxon cremation pyres to reflect the elevated status of the individual who had died. The tight cluster of the bone remnants, as well as some curious unknown fibers, suggest the remains were originally kept in a bag that was placed in the bucket. However, some bone fragments were also found right outside of the bucket, and copper-alloy staining from the bucket on the bones signals they were buried outside of the vessel at the same time, the researchers said. Both the human and animal bones are undergoing further study and radiocarbon dating to provide additional context. Several cremation burials at Sutton Hoo were placed in vessels such as ceramic pots and bronze bowls, including an impressive bronze hanging bowl on display in the High Hall exhibition. But buckets such as these are rare, and there hasn’t ever been one found with cremated remains inside, said Laura Howarth, archaeology and engagement manager for the National Trust’s Sutton Hoo site, in an email. The initial scans also suggested there were grave goods within the bucket, and the researchers painstakingly retrieved the delicate but largely intact double-sided comb, with fine tooth and wider tooth sides, likely made from an antler. The comb, unlike the bones, had not been burned. Combs made from bone and antler have been retrieved from male and female burials alike, and different sizes suggest they were used for grooming hair, beards and removing lice. The acidic soil at Sutton Hoo, which rotted away the wood of the Anglo-Saxon ship and only left impressions of planks and rows of iron rivets, means that many of the bone combs previously found at Sutton Hoo have not been well-preserved, Howarth said. The team was unable to determine the sex of the individual from the bone fragments, but the researchers are optimistic that they may be able to retrieve ancient DNA from the comb to uncover more about the person’s identity. Scientists are also eager to take a closer look at leaves and other plant remains found inside the bucket, which could provide clues on the climate, environment and season when the bucket was buried, said Naomi Sewpaul, an environmental archaeologist who analyzed the finds, in a by the British television turned online show “ .” “We knew that this bucket would have been a rare and prized possession back in Anglo-Saxon times, but it’s always been a mystery why it was buried,” said Angus Wainwright, a National Trust archaeologist, in a statement. “Now we know it was used to contain the remains of an important person in the Sutton Hoo community. I’m hopeful that further analysis will uncover more information about this very special burial.” The bucket’s base, which is in surprisingly good condition, was found in one piece, and CT scans showed concentric rings that suggest it was made by cold hammering — when metal such as copper is shaped by percussive movements without heating. There is currently no evidence to suggest that the bucket had a top. Questions still remain about the bucket’s original purpose and how it arrived in England. Researchers suspect it may have been a diplomatic gift, or it was acquired by a mercenary Saxon soldier. “We think that the bucket had a life prior to burial,” Howarth wrote in an email. “We can’t be certain how this bucket made hundreds of miles away in the Byzantine Empire ended up in this corner of Suffolk. (It) could have been an antique at the time of burial, a gift, a souvenir, etc. But by repurposing this luxury item as a cremation vessel, it is signaling something about the status of the individual interred (how they were perceived in both life and death) and their connections. These latest discoveries have helped redefine the bucket from a possible stray/isolated find to being part of a burial context.” The new research at Sutton Hoo is part of a two-year project, which began last summer, carried out by the National Trust, Field Archaeology Specialists, or FAS, Heritage, and “Time Team.” The project unearthed the bucket fragment during the final week of a monthlong excavation in the summer of 2024. Sutton Hoo has been the site of multiple excavations over the years because the discovery of the ship burial in the late 1930s changed the way historians understand Anglo-Saxon life. The 90-foot-long (27-meter) wooden ship was dragged half a mile (0.8 kilometer) from the River Deben when an Anglo-Saxon warrior king died 1,400 years ago. The burial was likely that of of East Anglia, who died around 624, and he was placed inside the ship, surrounded by treasures and buried within a mound. In addition to the famous ship burial, a royal burial ground and a sixth century Anglo-Saxon cemetery have been found at Sutton Hoo in the past. Archaeologists determined that the Anglo-Saxon cemetery, which predates the royal burial ground, contained 13 cremations and nine burials in 2000 ahead of construction of the Sutton Hoo visitor’s center. It’s believed that the people buried here were residents from low to relatively high-status families, and perhaps even the grandparents or great-grandparents of those later buried in the royal burial ground. This season’s excavations are already underway at Garden Field, a site close to the ship burial, and will continue through June to uncover more information about the Anglo-Saxon cemetery. “We’ve finally solved the puzzle of the Bromeswell bucket — now we know that it is the first of these rare objects ever to have been used in a cremation burial. It’s a remarkable mixture — a vessel from the southern, classical world containing the remains of a very northern, very Germanic cremation,” said Helen Geake, Time Team’s Anglo-Saxon expert, in a statement. “It epitomises the strangeness of Sutton Hoo — it has ship burials, horse burials, mound burials and now bath-bucket burials. Who knows what else it might still hold?”",

    "content": ". An Anglo-Saxon ship found at the Sutton Hoo estate in Suffolk, England, has long captivated history enthusiasts since its discovery on the eve of World War II. And the site of the seventh century royal burial has yielded still more wonders of the ancient past in more recent decades. In 1986, a tractor harrow unearthed pieces of a Byzantine bucket. Made from a thin sheet of copper alloy, the artifact depicts a North African hunting scene. The sixth century object had made an unusual journey from Antioch (in modern-day Turkey) to the eastern coast of Britain, researchers believe. Archaeologists found and assembled fragments of the bucket over the years, but its base — and any clues that could shed light on its purpose — remained elusive. Now, new excavations at Sutton Hoo have revealed the entire base of the bucket, as well as the contents it once housed: cremated remains, along with precious items that might help . In another remarkable find, when two hikers exploring the Krkonoše Mountains in the Czech Republic happened upon an aluminum box jutting from a stony wall, they uncovered a mysterious cache of gold bracelets, cigar cases, a powder compact and hundreds of coins. The duo took the discovery to the Museum of Eastern Bohemia in Hradec Králové, where experts are now studying the pieces. Community residents have been sharing speculations on where the trove could have come from, as none of the coins are of local origin, said Miroslav Novak, head of the museum’s department of archaeology. One hypothesis is that the collection is related to departures of Czech and Jewish populations prior to World War II, or the post-war German exodus in 1945, he said. But the most recent coin in the stash is dated 1921, which adds . If you’ve ever wondered why your teeth ache after biting into something very cold or sweet like ice cream, ancient fish may be the root cause (no pun intended!). New research has shown that dentine, the sensitive interior of human teeth, likely evolved from the sensory tissue within bumps on the exoskeletons of armored fish 465 million years ago. The fish used these bumps, called odontodes, to sense their surroundings in Earth’s early oceans, which were teeming with predators. Over time, the genetic tool kit for odontodes was repurposed for teeth in animals — and even humans. During the study, scientists had another surprising revelation: A fossil long thought to belong to an ancient fish was . Biologists and engineers at the University of California, Berkeley, teamed up to create an acrobatic robot with the leaping and landing skills of an animal. Watch this . Camera traps on Jicarón Island, an uninhabited island off the coast of Panama, have captured perplexing behavior by some male capuchin monkeys, according to a new study. A white-faced capuchin, nicknamed “Joker” for a scar on his mouth, was seen — and other juvenile male capuchins followed suit. Other than toting the babies on their backs, none of the capuchins interacted with or cared for the howlers, and eventually all the infants died of starvation. Given the endangered status of the howler monkey population on the island, researchers set out to find the possible motivations behind such unusual behavior — and they uncovered a behavioral tendency the primates share with humans as the likely reason. Two distant galaxies have entered into a “cosmic joust” while in the process of merging into one larger galaxy. As the massive objects hurtled toward one another at more than 1.1 million miles per hour (1.8 million kilometers per hour), one galaxy repeatedly pierced the other with intense radiation.

    "content": ". Three tombs dating back thousands of years have been unearthed in an burial complex. The tombs of three prominent statesmen from the New Kingdom era (1539 to 1077 BCE) have been uncovered in Luxor, according to Egypt’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. The discovery was made in the Dra’Abu El Naga, an important non-royal necropolis in Luxor, the ministry said in a statement Monday. The excavation was carried out entirely by Egyptians, according to Sherif Fathy, minister of tourism and antiquities, who called it a “significant” discovery for the country’s archaeological record in a post on the ministry’s account. Inscriptions inside the tombs allowed the excavation team to identify the names and titles of their owners, said Mohamed Ismail Khaled, secretary-general of Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities, in the statement. Further work will be needed to complete cleaning and studying remaining inscriptions in the tombs. One of the tombs belongs to a person called Amun-em-Ipet from the Ramesside period (usually considered to be the 19th and 20th dynasties) who either worked in the temple or the estate of Amun, the deity revered as king of the gods. Most scenes in his tomb were destroyed, except for depictions of furniture carriers and a banquet scene, the ministry said. Another tomb, dating back to the 18th dynasty, belonged to someone named Baki who worked as a granary supervisor, the ministry said. The third tomb, also dating back to the 18th dynasty, belonged to a person called Es, who was identified as holding several jobs: supervisor in the Temple of Amun, mayor of the northern oases and scribe. Abdel Ghaffar Wagdy, director-general of Luxor antiquities, who led the mission, described the tomb layouts in the statement provided by the ministry. According to Wagdy, Amun-em -Ipet’s tomb consists of a small courtyard, an entrance and a square hall ending with a niche, where a western wall was broken. Baki’s tomb consists of a long, corridor-like courtyard followed by another courtyard leading to its main entrance. An extended hall leads to another long hall, ending with an incomplete chamber containing his burial well. The tomb belonging to Es also has a small courtyard containing a well, followed by a main entrance, and a transverse hall leading to another – incomplete – long hall. The tombs mark yet another discovery made this year in Luxor. In February, a joint Egyptian-British archaeological mission unearthed the tomb of King Thutmose II in what officials at the time called a “remarkable” discovery.",

    "content": "Two long-planned vaccine meetings — one at the US Centers for Disease Control and another at the US Food and Drug Administration — have now been disrupted under the watch of US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., stirring questions about whether seasonal flu shots or other lifesaving vaccines will be delayed or harder to access. The February meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, was postponed “to accommodate public comment,” online. The three-day meeting, which had been scheduled for this week, was to review the safety and effectiveness of vaccines for meningococcal disease, which is seeing a resurgence, as well as RSV, flu, and mpox. It also related to Vaccines for Children, the government program that buys and distributes vaccines to state and local health departments for children whose families wouldn’t otherwise be able to pay for them. ACIP typically meets three times a year, in February, June and October. There’s no word on whether or when the February meeting will be rescheduled and it’s unclear whether the delay will hinder access to shots. On Wednesday, the a March 13 meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, which was to discuss the recipe manufacturers must follow to make this fall’s flu shots. No explanation was given for the cancellation. In a statement to CNN on Thursday, the FDA said it would still weigh in on the makeup of flu shots but didn’t indicate whether it would seek its advisers’ guidance or allow for the public discussion and debate that usually occurs. “The FDA will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season,” the statement said. The uncertainty around the government’s process for regulating and recommending vaccines comes as the US is in the grips of a and experiencing a , a vaccine preventable disease. Experts say these infections are increasing because of growing hesitancy to use vaccines, something they fear the new HHS director will only encourage. Kennedy maintains that he is not anti-vaccine, but he has repeatedly cast doubt on the safety and effectiveness of immunizations and questioned the research and regulations that allow them to be used. Kennedy, whose financial disclosures show he has that sue vaccine manufacturers, has also impugned some of the experts who advise federal agencies on vaccines. During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy incorrectly stated that 97% of the members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee had conflicts of interest. In fact, the panel has to guard against conflicts, and a screening process for members to ensure they are impartial when they vote. Members of FDA’s vaccine committee are also subject to strict conflict of interest rules and are required to disclose potential conflicts during meetings. This week, former CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden that false claims that ACIP members vote based on their financial ties is among the “most damaging” falsehoods about vaccines. Frieden said the 97% figure comes from a 2009 report, issued when he was CDC director. He is now president and CEO of the nonprofit Resolve to Save Lives. It was an audit of lengthy and detailed conflict of interest forms submitted by all experts who served as CDC advisers in 2007. He said 97% had at least one missing response, which could have meant someone forgot to do something as simple as initial a page. He said it is not the same thing as a conflict of interest. “I really think that this is classic misinformation,” Frieden told CNN. Frieden also raised alarm about the postponed ACIP meeting, writing in , “It’s certain there will be misleading, inaccurate information claiming ACIP members have conflicts of interest. Here’s the plain truth: ACIP, made up of pediatricians, public health specialists, and parents, is the gold standard for open, transparent recommendations on vaccine safety and effectiveness.” Without either vaccine committee weighing in on vaccine regulation or recommendations, health-care providers worry there will be delays on vaccines or limits on people’s ability to access them. “Cancelling this meeting means vaccine makers may not have the vital information and time they need to produce and distribute targeted vaccines before the next flu season,” Dr. Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said after the cancellation of the FDA flu shot meeting. “If the FDA meeting is not immediately rescheduled, many lives that could be saved by vaccination will be lost.” In a February 20 to Kennedy, Acting CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and Sen. Bill Cassidy a doctor and chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, a coalition of groups called the Partnership to Fight Infectious Disease pushed for the “prompt rescheduling” of the ACIP meeting. “Each ACIP meeting holds tremendous weight and relevance. Infectious diseases are constantly evolving opponents; vaccines are among the best tools for constantly adapting and responding to the latest public health threats,” the letter said. “Making America healthy requires healthy discussion and timely, evidence-based decisions. This meeting should be no different.” There are several different ways to make flu vaccines, but is to grow the selected candidate viruses in chicken eggs — a painstaking operation that takes months to finish. For that reason, selection of the strains that will be included in flu vaccines is carefully orchestrated to be sure that manufacturers can deliver their shots to doctor’s offices and pharmacies in time. In order for flu vaccines to be sold in the US, they must contain strains that are officially selected by the FDA. That decision typically comes after a meeting of the World Health Organization’s Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, seven collaborating centers and four essential regulatory labs, which are based in the US, UK, Japan, China, Russia and Australia. Both the CDC and FDA are members, and representatives from both agencies participated in the deliberations which got underway this week, WHO said. “The US did participate in this meeting,” Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead for Covid-19, said at a news briefing on Friday. “I want to be very clear that the US is still contributing. I know that there’s a lot of attention on the US right now, but we are going to continue to emphasize the importance of this global system that’s in place.” These experts meet twice a year — in the fall and spring — to choose strains for countries in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres. On Friday, the strains that it thinks will most closely match the viruses that will be making people sick next fall. Those picks would swap out the H3N2 component of this years vaccine, which was only a partial match to the circulating viruses, for a new one. “I think the match is not perfect, but it is a reasonable match, and is still the best preventative we have against infection with influenza,” said Prof. Ian Barr, deputy director at the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, and a member of GISRS, in a new briefing after the strain selection What typically happens next is that the 17-member FDA vaccine committee would meet and publicly discuss the recommendation, and then make its own endorsement. The agency ultimately makes the final decision, which can differ from its advisers’, although they generally align. This year, there won’t be an advisory meeting. The FDA said it would still make recommendations to manufacturers but didn’t specify how it would come to a decision or when. “If there’s no FDA recommended strains, the US manufacturers are kind of stuck,” said Dr. LJ Tan who is chief policy and partnerships officer for nonprofit vaccine advocacy group Immunize.org. Flu vaccine manufacturers contacted by CNN on Thursday said the missed VRBPAC meeting wouldn’t break their stride. “Just as every year, we have already begun production for the 2025-2026 flu season in the Northern Hemisphere and will be ready to support final strain selections in time for the season,” wrote Sanofi in a statement to CNN. GSK also said it will continue to work with FDA on its flu strain recommendation in the US. But canceling the VRBPAC meeting will deprive Americans of public discussion and debate that happens when these experts meet. It makes the process less transparent, Immunize.org’s Tan said. “It’s very dangerous to bypass your expert advisory committee,” Tan said. In his Senate confirmation hearings, Kennedy promised “radical transparency” at HHS. “Public health agencies should be transparent and if we want Americans to restore trust in the public health agencies, we need transparency,” Kennedy said. Vaccine advocates say canceling advisory committee meetings undermines that goal. “You heard what we thought. We disagreed on some things, and for people who are interested, you can see how we arrived at the conclusion that we did,” said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a member of FDA’s VRBPAC who is also a pediatrician and immunologist at the University of Iowa. Perlman said he was also worried that skipping committee meetings would deprive the public of a window into the government’s vaccine decisions. “The country is in so much flux right now about what it thinks about vaccines, what it thinks about medical devices, what it thinks about drugs. The more transparency there is, hopefully, the more people who are undecided about things will see where the committee is coming from,” Perlman told CNN’s Meg Tirrell. Other experts agreed the committees are an important layer of independent review. “It’s kind of taking experts out of the conversation,” said Dr. William Moss, a pediatrician who directs of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “Many of these decisions are tricky and nuanced, and having the opportunity for a group of experts who are familiar with these vaccines and familiar with these diseases. You know, have an open discussion is critically important.” The FDA has not said how it will choose vaccine strains for the fall, but if it follows WHO’s recommendation, it will mean that the US will be relying on data from the organization despite President Donald Trump’s that the US withdraw its support from WHO and stop sharing information. “It’s part of the chaos, whether it’s planned or not, or just incompetence,” Moss said.",

    "content": "The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers. CNN is showcasing the work of , a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. For people with chronic gynecological pain conditions, pain can be constant, making everyday activities like sitting, riding a bicycle and even wearing underwear extremely uncomfortable. For many of these people — most of whom identify as women — sexual intercourse and routine pelvic exams are unbearable. and , or chronic genital pain, are common gynecological conditions that can cause severe pain. They each affect about 1 in 10 American women. Yet many women face skepticism and gaslighting in health care settings when they seek care for this type of pain. We know this well through our research on and on manage difficult conversations with their doctors and family, as well as through volunteer work alongside people living with these conditions. We’ve consistently found that medical gaslighting around chronic gynecological pain is a complex societal problem, fueled by holes in medical research and training. A 2024 study of patients who went to a clinic for vulvovaginal pain — pain experienced in the external female genitals and vagina –- found that 45% of these patients had been told that they “ ” and 39% were made to feel that they were “crazy.” A staggering 55% had considered giving up on seeking care. These results echo what one of us — Elizabeth Hintz — found in her 2023 meta-synthesis: Female patients with chronic pain conditions frequently hear this “ ” response from doctors. Another study followed patients in two different major US cities who were seeking care for vulvovaginal pain. The researchers found that most patients saw multiple clinicians but . Given the challenges of seeking medical care, many patients turn to social . These studies, among others, illustrate how people with these conditions often spend years going to clinician after clinician seeking care and being told their pain is psychological or perhaps not even real. Given these experiences, why do patients keep seeking care? “Let me describe the pain that would drive me to try so many different doctors, tests and treatments,” said to her doctor. For her, sex “is like taking your most sensitive area and trying to rip it apart.” “I can now wear any pants or underwear that I want with no pain,” said another patient after successful treatment. “I never realized how much of a toll the pain took on my body every day until it was gone.” Many — where a patient’s health concerns are not given appropriate medical evaluation and are instead downplayed, misattributed or dismissed outright. Medical gaslighting is rooted in centuries of gender bias in medicine. Women’s reproductive health issues have long been dismissed as Genital and pelvic pain especially has been misattributed to psychological rather than biological causes: A century ago, Freudian psychoanalysts incorrectly believed that female sexual pain came from psychological complexes like penis envy. These historical views help shed light on why these symptoms are still not taken seriously today. In addition to the physical toll of untreated pain, medical gaslighting can take . Women may become . Some internalize this disbelief and can begin to doubt their own perceptions of pain and even their sanity. This cycle of gaslighting compounds the burden of the pain and might lead to like anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms. For some, the repeated experience of being dismissed by clinicians in the health care system. They might hesitate to seek medical attention in the future, fearing they will once again be dismissed. Although some chronic gynecological pain conditions like are and becoming better understood, these dynamics persist. Part of the reason for the misunderstanding surrounding chronic gynecological pain conditions is the lack of research on them. A January report from the National Academies found that research on compared with diseases disproportionately affecting men. This problem has gotten worse over time. The proportion of funding from the National Institutes of Health spent on women’s health has actually . Despite these known disparities, in April the Trump administration threatened to end funding for the Women’s Health Initiative, , further worsening the problem. Without sustained federal funding for women’s health research, conditions like endometriosis and vulvodynia will remain poorly understood, leaving clinicians in the dark and patients stranded. As hard as it is for any female patient to have their pain believed and treated, is even harder for those who face discrimination based on class or race. One 2016 study found that half of the white medical students surveyed about biological differences between Black and white patients, such as that Black people have physically thicker skin or less sensitive nerve endings than white people. The medical students and residents who endorsed these false beliefs also underestimated Black patients’ pain and offered them less accurate treatment recommendations. Studies show that and report than men. But women are and thus less reliable in describing their pain than men. Consequently, female patients who describe the same symptoms as male patients are judged to be in less pain and are , even in . Compared to male patients, female patients are more likely to be prescribed . These lingering erroneous beliefs about gender and race are key reasons patients’ pain is dismissed, misunderstood and ignored. The very real-life consequences for patients include delayed diagnosis, treatment and even death. Correcting these problems will require a shift in clinical training, so as to challenge biased views about pain in women and racial minorities and to educate clinicians about common pain conditions like vulvodynia. Research suggests that medical training needs to teach students to better listen to patients’ lived experiences and . In the meantime, people navigating the health care system can take practical steps when encountering dismissive care. They can educate themselves about chronic gynecological pain conditions by reading books like “ ” or educational information from trusted sources like the , the and the . Although these steps do not address the roots of medical gaslighting, they can empower patients to better understand the medical conditions that could cause their symptoms, helping to counteract the effects of gaslighting. If someone you know has experienced medical gaslighting and would like support, there are resources available. Organizations like and the offer support networks and information — like how to . Additionally, connecting with patient advocacy groups like can provide opportunities for patients to engage in changing the health care system.",

    "content": "When jolted awake by the blare of an , it’s tempting to reach for the snooze button to catch a bit more shut-eye. In my case, “just five more minutes” is practically a morning mantra. And what’s the harm? There’s increasing debate about your snoozing habit, and whether or not it’s silently sabotaging your morning. On the “stop snoozing” side of the research, sleep scientist Dr. Rebecca Robbins suggests the snooze alarm may actually cost us sleep. “That first alarm may interrupt vital stages of sleep, and anything that you might be able to get after hitting the snooze alarm is probably going to be low quality and fragmented sleep,” said Robbins, an associate scientist for the Division of Sleep and Circadian Disorders at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. The average snoozer takes an extra 11 minutes after their first alarm, according to a new coauthored by Robbins that used data from the sleep-tracking app SleepCycle. That adds up to about one night’s worth of sleep per month spent snoozing. As we sleep, the brain cycles through different stages of neurological activity and the second half of the night is dominated by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, when most of our dreaming is thought to take place. It’s an important sleep stage for our cognitive function and memory consolidation, said Robbins, who is also an assistant professor of medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “When you press the snooze button, especially for just a few minutes at a time, you’re not likely to return to that REM stage,” Robbins said. But for a different take, there are sleep experts like Dr. Justin Fiala, a pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine physician at Northwestern Medicine Canning Thoracic Institute. There isn’t consensus on whether this lighter sleep achieved during a snooze session always does more harm than good, said Fiala, who is also an assistant professor at Northwestern Medicine. On one hand, losing out on quality sleep instead of just waking up later may increase the risk of and . “Certainly, if you’re feeling worse off (and) more tired from the snooze alarm, I would recommend going back to waking up cold turkey without it,” said Fiala, who also runs the CommunityHealth Chicago sleep clinic. On the other hand, those with a certain chronotype — a natural disposition determined by factors such as age and genetics — may benefit from the habit, Fiala said, referencing which found night owls tend to rely on their snooze button more. “If your chronotype is nocturnal, you’re a night owl, but your work schedule requires you to be up at 5 a.m., that increases the dissonance between what your body is naturally inclined to do,” Fiala said. For these night owls, the brief period of light sleep induced by the snooze button may actually help them transition from deeper stages of sleep interrupted by the first alarm into wakefulness, he said, adding that more research should be done to fully understand this effect and its limitations. Regardless of one’s chronotype, this distinction of gets the most out of snoozing can also help inform to get the most out of snoozing. Most sleep experts emphasize adults get the recommended per night for good health and emotional well-being. Sleeping enough can also reduce feelings of tiredness upon waking, but the consistency of your sleep timing is just as important as duration, said Kimberly Honn, an associate professor of psychology at Washington State University Spokane. At deep stages of sleep, electric pulses of the brain reach a highly rhythmic pattern different from our more erratic, awakened state, she explained. Trying to wake up during these stages cuts important brain maintenance processes short and can lead one to experience the foggy effects of sleep inertia, which can last for several minutes or even hours after waking up. When the body is accustomed to a regular sleep schedule, it may reduce the experience of sleep inertia upon waking, Honn said. The body can grow accustomed to moving through each sleep stage at similar times, ensuring sleep cycles are completed before waking and eventually allowing you to fall asleep faster. “In the perfect world, we would not be relying on an alarm clock at all,” Robbins said. “We would be able to fall asleep and wake up naturally and have energy throughout the day.” Fiala said he generally recommends varying bedtimes by no more than 30 minutes per night, even on weekends. If you have to switch schedules, he says you should change it incrementally over time. It’s possible people who use the snooze button less simply don’t have the luxury to sleep past their alarm, Robbins suggested. Inflexible work schedules could require first responders to start their shift promptly, or parents may have to rally their children out the door and toward the school bus. For this reason, Robbins recommends those trying to ditch a snoozing habit introduce more time constraints into their morning routine by setting the first alarm as late as possible. “Ask yourself: Is there anything in that morning routine that you could maybe do without? Or maybe you could find a way to do it faster?” Robbins said. Snoozing could also mean you’re losing out on time that could be used for adding wakefulness-promoting habits into your morning routine. The heaviest snoozers tracked in Robbins’ study used around 22 to 27 minutes resting after the first alarm — time that could be used for stretching, journaling or cooking a nutritious breakfast, Robbins suggested. “We talk a lot about wind down routines and bedtime rituals. I think morning rituals are also really lovely to help you get excited about your day,” Robbins said. “It’s important to find something to look forward to, whether that’s a meeting in the morning, making yourself a cup of coffee, whatever helps motivate you (and) gets you out of bed.” Timing your alarm to the sunrise and allowing natural light to come through your windows in the morning can also help signal your body to wake up, Honn said.",

    "title": "\n      Sperm donor with rare genetic mutation fathered 67 children. Ten now have cancer, prompting calls for reform\n    ",

    "content": "The sperm of a man carrying a rare genetic mutation linked to cancer was used to conceive scores of children across Europe, prompting calls for greater regulation and a limit on the number of births allowed from a single donor. Sperm from the donor was used to conceive at least 67 children from 46 families born between 2008 and 2015, said Edwige Kasper, a biologist at Rouen University Hospital in France, during a presentation at the annual conference of the European Society of Human Genetics in Milan on Saturday. Ten of the children have already been diagnosed with cancer. “At the heart of the problem seems to lie the regulation, or maybe the lack of regulation, of the number of births by a single donor,” she said. Analysis showed that the donor, who is himself healthy, had a rare mutation in a gene named TP53, which is likely to cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare disorder that increases a person’s risk of developing cancer. The mutation was not known when the donation was made, but children born from this donor have since been identified in eight different European countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom, said Kasper in her presentation. Ten of them have been diagnosed with cancers such as brain tumors and Hodgkin lymphoma, and another 13 children are carrying the gene but have not yet developed a cancer. They will require regular medical examinations due to their increased risk of developing cancer, and have a 50% chance of transmitting it on to their own children, said Kasper. “The follow-up protocol involves whole-body MRI scans, MRI scans of the brain and, for adults, of the breast, ultrasound examination of the abdomen, and a clinical examination by a specialist. This is heavy and stressful for carriers, but we have seen its effectiveness in that it has enabled early detection of tumours and thus improved patients’ chances of survival,” said Kasper in a press release. Unlike in some cases of serial sperm donors, such as a Dutch man after being found to have fathered between 500 and 600 children around the world, this man only donated to a single private sperm bank in Denmark named the European Sperm Bank. Julie Paulli Budtz, vice-president of corporate communications at the European Sperm Bank, told CNN that it was “deeply affected by this case.” “The donor has been thoroughly tested even above the required standards, but preventative genetic screening is reaching its limits here,” she said in a statement sent to CNN on Monday. “Every human being has about 20,000 genes, and it is scientifically simply not possible to detect disease-causing mutations in a person’s gene pool if you don’t know what you are looking for.” There is currently no limit on the number of children that are allowed to be born using a single donor, something which Budtz said the European Sperm Bank would like to change. “This is also why, in addition to following national pregnancy limits, we have proactively implemented our own international limit of 75 families per donor,” she said. This limit is self-imposed as regulations vary from country to country. For example, France has a limit of 10 births per donor, while Denmark allows 12 and Germany allows up to 15, according to the press release. “There is a major issue here concerning a lack of harmonised regulation across Europe,” Kasper said in the release. “We need proper regulation at European level to try to prevent it happening again, and to implement measures to ensure a worldwide limit on the number of offspring conceived from the same donor.”",

    "content": "All the work that goes into losing weight in middle age could set you up for a longer, healthier life later, according to a new study. A sustained weight loss of about 6.5% of body weight without medications or surgery in middle-aged people is linked to substantial long-term health benefits, said lead study author Dr. Timo Strandberg, professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Helsinki in Finland. Those benefits included a reduction of risk for both chronic diseases and death from all causes. The study, published Tuesday in the journal , analyzed data of about 23,000 people from three different groups across different time periods: one group from 1985 to 1988, another from 1964 to 1973, and a third between 2000 and 2013. Researchers grouped the people in the studies based on their starting (BMI) and whether they gained, lost or maintained weight and compared the patterns with hospitalizations and death records. People who lost weight in midlife were less likely to experience heart attacks, strokes, cancer, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in their older years, according to the study. Those who lost weight were also less likely to have died of any cause over the next 35 years, the study found. It’s important to note that much of the data was collected before weight loss medications or surgeries were widely available, meaning that the benefits largely came from body changes driven by alterations in diet and exercise, Strandberg said. The study is important because it provides evidence of the relationship between weight loss and both cardiovascular disease and mortality, which hasn’t been studied enough, said Dr. Aayush Visaria, a clinical researcher and incoming instructor of medicine at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Jersey. He was not involved in the research. Although the study is strong in that it utilizes a large sample, there are some limitations when applying the results, Visaria said. The study was conducted on White Europeans, meaning that it’s difficult to generalize the results to different populations, Strandberg said. “BMI is very different across different racial ethnic groups,” Visaria said. And BMI, which looks at weight in proportion to height, isn’t always the most accurate way to gauge body composition, he added. BMI is still used widely because it is easy to calculate, but it doesn’t differentiate based on a person’s proportion of bone or muscle, Visaria said. “There’s so many variables that might play into how someone’s body composition changes, even though maybe their weight might not change as much,” Visaria said. Other studies suggest that the fat distribution makes a big difference –– the fat around a person’s organs may be what really drives a lot of disease risk, he said. Lifestyle changes –– such as a healthy diet and more exercise –– were important factors in the risk reduction. The study was observational, meaning that the data can show a relationship between weight loss and a reduction in chronic disease and mortality risk, but researchers can’t say for sure that the weight loss was the factor that lowered the risk, Visaria said. Although the researchers adjusted for other factors that could influence the risk, such as age, they did not adjust for lifestyle behaviors such as diet and physical activity, he added. Those changes could be behind the lowered risk of chronic diseases just as the weight loss itself could be, Visaria said. Both weight loss and the behavioral changes behind it are often tied together in improving health, Strandberg noted. Weight loss relieves conditions such as osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnea and fatty liver, while changes to diet and exercise have been shown to decrease cardiovascular risks, he added. Lifestyle is always important when it comes to good health, meaning that you should continue to strive for a healthy diet and good physical activity –– even if you are using weight loss medications, Visaria said. The –– which prioritizes fruits, vegetables, grains, olive oil, and nuts and seeds –– has consistently been ranked the best diet for wellness and disease prevention. Studies suggest this way of eating may in older years, prevent some and lower . For physical activity, the recommends that adults engage in at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, along with muscle-strengthening activities at least twice a week. However, obesity is not just a problem individuals need to tackle –– it is a structural issue as well, Strandberg said. Healthy foods and opportunities for physical activity need to be more accessible in modern societies to help curb the health impacts associated with obesity, he added.",

    "title": "\n      Feds chop enforcement staff and halt rules meant to curb black lung in coal miners\n    ",

    "content": "In early April, President Donald Trump gathered dozens of hard-hat-clad coal miners around him in the White House East Room. He joked about arm-wrestling them and announced he was signing executive orders to boost coal production, “ ,” and to “put the miners back to work.” Trump said he calls it “beautiful, clean” coal. “I tell my people never use the word ‘coal’ unless you put ‘beautiful, clean’ before it.” That same day, the Trump administration paused implementation of a rule that would help protect coal miners from an aggressive form of black lung disease. Enforcement of the new protections is officially halted until at least mid-August, that came a few days after a federal court agreed to put enforcement on hold to hear an industry challenge. But even if the rule takes full force after the delay, the federal agency tasked with enforcing it in Appalachia and elsewhere may not be up to the task after sweeping layoffs and office closures. Deaths from black lung — a chronic condition caused by inhaling coal dust — since the introduction of over a half-century ago. But in recent decades, . By 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that the lungs of about 1 in 5 coal miners in central Appalachia showed evidence of black lung. It is being diagnosed in younger miners. And the deadliest form, progressive massive fibrosis, has increased tenfold among long-term miners. Silica is the primary culprit. Exposure to it has increased since mining operations began cutting through more sandstone to reach deeper coal deposits. The stone breaks into sharp particles that, when airborne, can become trapped in lung tissue and cause a debilitating, sometimes fatal condition. The new rule was set to take effect in April, cutting the allowable level of silica dust in the air inside mines by half — to the limit already in place for other industries — and set stricter guidelines for enforcement. Years in the making, advocates for miners heralded the new standards as a breakthrough. “It is unconscionable that our nation’s miners have worked without adequate protection from silica dust despite it being a known health hazard for decades,” said when the rule was announced last spring under the Biden administration. The rule pause came on top of another blow to mine safety oversight. In March, the Department of Government Efficiency, created by a Trump executive order, announced it would end leases for as many as three dozen field offices of the Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration, with the future of those employees undetermined. That agency is responsible for enforcing mining safety laws. Then in April, two-thirds — nearly 900 — of the workers at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, were fired. As a result, NIOSH’s Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program, which offered miners free screenings from a mobile clinic, ceased operations. An announcement by MSHA of the silica rule delay cited the “unforeseen NIOSH restructuring and other technical reasons” as catalysts for the pause but didn’t mention the federal court decision in the case seeking to rescind the rule. Separately, on May 7, attorney filed a class-action lawsuit against Health and Human Services and its head, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to reinstate the program. His client in the case, Harry Wiley, a West Virginia coal miner, was diagnosed with an early stage of black lung and applied to NIOSH for a transfer to an environment with less dust exposure but never received a response. He continues to work underground. On May 13, U.S. District Judge Irene Berger issued a preliminary injunction to reinstate the surveillance program employees. The next day, Kennedy said the administration would . That day, they were back at work. “Remaining in a dusty job may reduce the years in which Mr. Wiley can walk and breathe unassisted, in addition to hastening his death,” Berger wrote. “It is difficult to imagine a clearer case of irreparable harm.” MSHA officials declined to respond to specific questions about the silica rule or plans to implement and enforce it, citing the ongoing litigation. In an emailed statement, Labor Department spokesperson Courtney Parella said, “The Mine Safety and Health Administration is confident it can enforce all regulations under its purview. MSHA inspectors continue to conduct legally required inspections and remain focused on MSHA’s core mission to prevent death, illness, and injury from mining and promote safe and healthful workplaces for U.S. miners.” Wes Addington is quick to say a career in the mines isn’t necessarily a death sentence. He comes from generations of miners. One of his great-grandfathers worked 48 years underground and died at 88. But Addington also said protecting the safety and health of miners requires diligence. He’s executive director of the , a Whitesburg, Kentucky, nonprofit that represents and advocates for miners and their families. A study the center conducted found that staffers at the MSHA offices scheduled to close performed almost from January 2024 through February 2025. Addington said NIOSH provided the data to document worsening conditions over the past few decades. Addington’s organization has advocated for the new silica rule for 17 years. “We didn’t think it was perfect,” he said. He would have preferred lower exposure limits and more stringent monitoring requirements. “But, as it was, it was going to save lives.” The cuts to the agency, Addington said, could affect every American worker who might be exposed to harmful elements in the workplace. NIOSH approves respirators prescribed by Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations. With fewer inspectors, miners are “more likely to get hurt on the job and those injuries could be fatal,” he said. “And if you’re a miner that’s lucky enough to navigate that gantlet and make it through a 20-, 25-year career,” Addington said, “the likelihood that you develop disabling lung disease that ultimately kills you at an early age is much increased.” The black lung clinic at in southwestern Virginia has diagnosed 75 new cases of progressive massive fibrosis in the past year, according to its medical director, Drew Harris. “People are dying from a dust-related disease that’s 100% preventable, and we’re not using all the things we could use to help prevent their disease and save their lives,” Harris said. “It’s just all very disheartening.” He believes it would be a mistake for Kennedy to reorganize NIOSH , shifting the surveillance program team’s responsibilities to other employees. “It’s a very unique expertise,” Harris said. The agency would be “losing the people that know how to do this well and that have been doing this for decades.” Rex Fields first went to work in the mines in 1967, a year before an near the small town of Farmington, West Virginia. His wife, Tilda Fields, was aware of the hazards her husband would encounter — the safety issues, the long-term health concerns. Her dad died of black lung when she was 7. But it meant a well-paying job in a region that has forever offered precious few. Rex, 77, now lives with an advanced stage of black lung disease. He’s still able to mow his lawn but is easily winded when walking uphill. It took him several weeks and two rounds of antibiotics to recover from a bout with bronchitis in March. Throughout his career, Rex advocated for his fellow miners: He stepped in when he saw someone mistreated; he once tried, unsuccessfully, to help a unionization effort. For these efforts, he said, “I got transferred from the day shift to the third shift a time or two.” Today, the Fieldses lobby on behalf of miners and share information about occupational dangers. Tilda organized a support group for families and widows. She worries about the next generation. Two of the Fieldses’ sons also went into mining. “People in the mountains here, we learn to make do,” Tilda said. “But you want better. You want better for your kids than what we had, and you surely want their safety.”",

    "content": "The US Food and Drug Administration will now require Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna to use expanded warning labels with more information about the risk of a rare heart condition after vaccination. The vaccines’ previous labels warned about the risk of a heart condition called myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, inflammation of the lining outside the heart, which the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website but possible after vaccination. The new labels will expand that warning to certain age groups. has consistently shown that the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and millions of people have gotten them without serious incident. Some studies have found that Covid-19 infection itself carries a risk of myocarditis or pericarditis than the vaccine does. The CDC last month that research showed Covid-19 vaccinations from 2020 through 2022 showed a statistically significant increased risk of myocarditis. The incidents were rare, however, and “there is no increased risk observed with the doses administered in subsequent years,” the agency said. In the rare case that someone did develop heart inflammation after vaccination, the CDC , acute myocarditis typically resolves quickly. The vaccines already carried warnings that the highest risk of these heart problems was observed in males between ages 18 and 24 for the Moderna vaccine and 12 to 17 for Pfizer’s; the new warnings for both vaccines will be for males age 16 to 25. In letters to and that were dated April 17 and are now posted online, the agency says analysis of commercial health insurance claims data shows that there were eight cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis per million vaccine doses given to people ages 6 months through 64 years. Cases were more common among males ages 16 through 25 within seven days of vaccination, but they were still rare, with about 38 cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis per million doses among this group. A spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday that the move was intended to increase “radical transparency.” Neither Pfizer nor Moderna responded to requests for comment. The vaccines were developed during the first Trump administration and underwent what was “the most intensive safety analysis in US history,” and the agency continues to monitor vaccine administration data for effectiveness and any potential problems. US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, has claimed that the Covid-19 vaccine was “the deadliest vaccine ever made.” In a US Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee on Wednesday,  Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, claimed that the Biden administration downplayed the risks of the vaccine and delayed getting information about those risks to the public. One witness, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, a family physician, said in his the US vaccine safety monitoring systems worked “exactly as intended” by detecting rare cases of myocarditis. “The data were made public, warnings were updated, and clinical guidance was revised accordingly,” Green said. “Despite this, some continue to promote misleading interpretations, unverified claims or anecdotes to suggest that vaccines are broadly unsafe.” The FDA has taken recent steps to limit Covid-19 vaccines for certain groups. the FDA said it would change the type of evidence it will accept from vaccine manufacturers to approve updated Covid shots, which may limit who is eligible for updated shots. The vaccines are expected to be be available in the fall, for adults 65 and older and people with underlying conditions that put them at a higher risk for severe Covid-19 infection. In an in the New England Journal of Medicine, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary and Dr. Vinay Prasad, the new director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said there’s not enough evidence that healthy children and adults get clinically meaningful benefit from regular Covid-19 shots, and officials want to see more placebo-controlled trials, particularly in adults 50 to 64, before recommending the shots for other groups. On the FDA’s vaccine advisers – the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee – will meet to discuss the coronavirus strain selection for this fall’s Covid-19 vaccines.",

    "title": "\n      Kennedy said a ‘team’ is in Milwaukee to help with lead contamination. The city says that’s not true\n    ",

    "content": "US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told a Senate subcommittee on Tuesday that the federal government has “a team in Milwaukee” helping the city address a lead crisis in its schools. The city says that that’s not true and that it’s still not receiving requested aid from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s childhood lead poisoning experts to deal with the ongoing contamination. During a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing to review the president’s HHS budget request for 2026, Kennedy fielded questions about programs and staff already slashed from federal health agencies. CNN reported in April that the CDC had denied the city’s request for help with lead exposures in Milwaukee Public Schools’ aging buildings after the agency’s lead experts were swept up in widespread cuts at US health agencies. Kennedy and HHS have said that the government plans to continue the work of lead poisoning prevention and surveillance at the new Administration for a Healthy America, rather than the CDC. The CDC’s experts have not been rehired. “None have been rehired from our lead program or our division,” Dr. Erik Svendsen, who was director of the Division of Environmental Health Science and Practice, which oversaw the childhood lead program, told CNN on Tuesday. In response to questions Tuesday from Sen. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, about the demise of the CDC’s childhood lead poisoning prevention program, Kennedy said, “We are continuing to fund the program, and in Milwaukee, we have a team in Milwaukee, and we’re giving laboratory support to that, to the analytics in Milwaukee, and we’re working with the health department in Milwaukee.” Caroline Reinwald, a spokesperson for the City of Milwaukee Health Department, said Kennedy’s statement “is inaccurate.” “The City of Milwaukee Health Department is not receiving any federal epidemiological or analytical support related to the MPS lead hazard crisis. Our formal Epi Aid request was denied by the CDC,” she wrote in an email from CNN. Reinwald said the department did recently get help from a lab technician from the CDC’s Laboratory Leadership Service, who was there from May 5 to May 16 to help calibrate a new instrument in the city’s laboratory. “This support was requested independently of the MPS crisis and was part of a separate, pre-existing need to expand our lab’s long-term capacity for lead testing,” Reinwald said. Beyond the contamination in schools, the city has ongoing programs to test for and remediate lead in its aging homes. Earlier this month, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta asked the city’s health commissioner, Dr. Michael Totoraitis, if the agency had enough resources to accomplish what it needed to do. “We have enough of a team right now,” Totoraitis said. “I think the long-term investigation into the potential chronic exposures of students at the districts is a part that we were really looking to the CDC to help us with, and unfortunately, HHS had laid off that entire team for childhood blood exposure. “These are the best and brightest minds in these areas around lead poisoning, and now they’re gone.” Andrew Nixon, director of communications for HHS, says the CDC is helping the Milwaukee health agency’s lab. At the health department’s request, he said in a statement Tuesday, “CDC is assisting with validating new lab instrumentation used for environmental lead testing. Staff from [the Milwaukee lab] are focused on the lead response and other routine testing while CDC will assist with testing validation, laboratory quality management, and regulatory requirement documentation to onboard the new laboratory instrument.” The city says that the CDC lab technician has left and is not expected to return. As of now, it doesn’t anticipate any further help from the CDC. “MHD is proud of the team currently serving Milwaukee families, managing its regular caseload while also responding to the lead crisis in MPS schools. While we would have welcomed federal support, we continue to move forward without it,” Reinwald said in a statement. At the end of Tuesday’s hearing, Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, made a statement to “correct the record.” “There are no staff on the ground deployed to Milwaukee to address the lead exposure of children in schools, and there are no staff left in that office at CDC, because they have all been fired,” Baldwin told Kennedy. “I look forward to working with you to reestablish that. It sounds like you have a commitment to that, but we need staff in order to make it function.”",

    "content": "Poor diet, environmental toxins, unhealthy habits and pharmaceuticals are contributing to a national rise in chronic illnesses, particularly among children, top Trump officials said in a Thursday report that lays the groundwork for a “Make America Healthy Again” overhaul of government policy. Leaders of the MAHA Commission including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will present their conclusions, which echo many of Kennedy’s long held priorities, to President Donald Trump at a White House event Thursday afternoon. The government panel is recommending that federal agencies reassess the nation’s childhood vaccine schedule, scrutinize ultraprocessed foods, and study pesticides widely used in commercial farming. The report is the first step of the administration’s plan to address what President Trump has called a crisis of chronic disease in America. In a Feb. 13 , Trump demanded an initial assessment of the potential drivers of chronic illnesses within 100 days; the commission is expected to deliver a strategy within the next 100 days. Yet even before its release this week, farmers, food manufacturers, and some Republican lawmakers were raising concerns about the report’s implications for the American food supply, particularly its call to reassess pesticides approved for use by the Environmental Protection Agency. Autism advocates and researchers have also railed against Kennedy’s suggestions that rates of autism spectrum disorders are booming due to environmental and pharmaceutical factors. The report suggests links between autism and food dyes or environmental toxins, but does not discuss Kennedy’s previous claims that there is a link between vaccines and autism. It is also not clear how much the report’s broad recommendations to launch studies on nutritious food, vaccines and environmental exposures will cost. “There is no budget,” Kennedy told reporters in a Thursday briefing. “At this point, there’s no concrete policy that could be funded in the budget; we’re going to work out the policy recommendations over the next 100 days.” But, he added: “We’re going to save a lot more money in the long run and even in the short run, if we can reduce the numbers, which we intend to do during this administration.” The MAHA commission calls for studies on the broad schedule of childhood vaccines, more research into potential adverse effects of vaccination, and “true” placebo studies of those childhood immunizations, echoing many of Kennedy’s longtime rallying points around vaccine safety. The commission encourages “open dialogue” around risks and benefits of vaccines. While the report does not explicitly draw the disproven link between vaccination and autism, it notes that “many [parents] have concerns about the appropriate use of vaccines and their possible role in the growing childhood chronic disease crisis.” Asked about subsequent studies on vaccines and autism, Kennedy told reporters that “the prescription comes in 100 days, how we’re going to handle it, but we’re already doing a lot of the research. We were not waiting for this report to come out to begin researching the crises, including the autism crisis.” Officials recommend expanding a new project, linking the National Institutes of Health with Medicare and Medicaid data, to examine environmental factors in childhood diseases. HHS this month to study potential causes and economic impacts of autism. The report also states that American children are overprescribed pharmaceuticals, including ADHD medicines, antidepressants, asthma and GLP-1 drugs, as a result of “misaligned incentives” in the health care system. It cites research suggesting no clear benefit from antipsychotic antidepressant medicine in children. It goes on to say that ADHD, depression and intellectual disabilities are diagnosed “disproportionately” in young children, leading to “unnecessary drugs, treatments, and social stigma.” The commission’s report flagged studies that suggest links between commonly used atrazine- and glyphosate-based weedkillers, such as RoundUp, and illnesses including reproductive disorders, cancer and liver complications. But it quickly also cited research from the Food and Drug Administration and the EPA that states the vast majority of food samples and farming practices are compliant with federal regulations. The EPA has previously said these products are unlikely to cause cancer. But media reports that the MAHA commission would likely highlight widely used herbicides led agricultural groups and lawmakers representing agricultural areas to attempt to get ahead of the report. “We welcome efforts to improve health outcomes in America but recommendations to limit farming practices based on unproven theories could have severe unintended consequences,” The American Farm Bureau Federation said in statement Tuesday, ahead of the report’s release. “History teaches us that it takes a very long time to rebuild public confidence once it is lost – even if the loss is caused by incorrect or incomplete information. This is certainly true when it comes to the food system.” In a statement to CNN, the National Corn Growers Association said it was deeply troubled by the report. “Decades of extensive research and testing show that pesticides, including atrazine and glyphosate, can be applied safely for their intended uses,” the association said. “We call on the administration to respect the existing body of science on pesticides and, moving forward, to include America’s farmers in discussion as this process evolves.” Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith also raised this concern in a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing with Kennedy that day. “If Americans lose confidence in the safety and integrity of our food supply due to the unfound claims that mislead consumers, public health will be at risk,” Hyde-Smith said. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins told reporters Thursday that the report’s questions are intended to improve agricultural technology, not destabilize American confidence in the food supply. “Do all of us agree on everything? Of course not. But the place that we have landed, which I think all of us agree, is that this is not a binary choice between an industry, agriculture, and health,” Rollins said. “What I have been very encouraged by, [with] Secretary Kennedy, when we were in Texas together and our dozens and dozens of conversations, is that none of this will compromise the ability of our American agriculture to do what they do best, which is to feed the country and the world.” The report states that children are consuming too many ultra-processed grains, sugars and fats, contributing to childhood obesity and diabetes rates. It also cites food additives including artificial sweeteners and preservatives, that some research suggests could be associated with chronic illnesses. The commission recommends independent studies on food ingredients that are generally recognized as safe, and long-term NIH trials comparing ultraprocessed food diets to whole food regimens. “I think everybody wants to prioritize the ultra processed food crisis and try to reduce our reliance” on these foods, Kennedy told reporters on Thursday The report also calls out industry lobbying and the “corporate capture” of health agencies long lamented by Kennedy. “Evidence suggests that pharmaceutical money strongly influences congressional legislation through lobbying and the manipulation of patient advocacy groups, and exerts considerable financial control over the FDA and its employees,” it states, made by the health secretary to FDA employees last month. The report goes on to detail lobbying efforts, advertising campaigns and scientific literature funding by pharmaceutical and food industries, laying the foundation for a crackdown that could be laid out in the commission’s subsequent strategy report.",

    "content": "The federal government may have partial answers on the purported causes of autism by this fall, but not the full picture, as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promised in April. Kennedy sat down with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Thursday shortly after a White House event to release the Make America Healthy Again Commission’s , which argued that ultaprocessed foods, environmental toxins and overmedication are driving a rise in childhood chronic illnesses. The commission’s next report, spelling out strategies to combat chronic diseases across health, agricultural and environmental agencies, will be released this August, Kennedy said. But his self-declared deadline to distill the drivers of autism by September — as — is slipping. “We’ll have some of the information [by September]. To get the most solid information, it will probably take us another six months,” Kennedy said Thursday. By the end of those additional six months, or roughly March, “I expect we will know the answers of the etiology of autism,” he said. Autism researchers and scientists have questioned the likelihood of delivering definitive conclusions on the drivers of autism in such a short timeframe, considering the years of research that is often undertaken in this area. That research has already identified likely factors leading to autism, including genetics and prenatal exposures. Yet Kennedy said Thursday that HHS “will have some studies completed by September,” primarily replications of previous research. “We’re also deploying new teams of scientists, 15 groups of scientists. We’re going to send those grants out to bid within three weeks,” he said. National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya has suggested that results could take longer. “Science happens at its own pace,” he told reporters in April, adding that he would like to see “preliminary results” within a year. The ability to replicate research, or repeat studies and arrive at the same results, has been a core priority of Bhattacharya and was highlighted in the MAHA report. Kennedy seemed to suggest Thursday that scientists could draw different conclusions from that research than those working on previous studies. Kennedy also addressed his terse exchanges in Senate hearings this month with Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who has questioned his response to an ongoing lead crisis in Milwaukee public schools. Kennedy told senators during an appropriations hearing this week that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a team on the ground in Milwaukee to help. The city said . In his interview with CNN, Kennedy clarified Thursday that the CDC is giving Milwaukee assistance “with their lab, their analytics and advice,” but said he did not know how many CDC officials were onsite in Milwaukee. CNN’s Collins said there was one technician on the ground, before Kennedy referenced those hearings. “You could hear my other exchanges with Tammy Baldwin,” he said. “And anyway, I’m not necessarily believing what Senator Baldwin says.” Kennedy also addressed the pushback from major agricultural groups Thursday over the MAHA report’s inclusion of studies suggesting toxic exposure from commonly used herbicides. Organizations including the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Corn Growers Association released statements saying the insinuations about pesticide risks could erode Americans’ confidence in the national food supply. Asked about their criticisms, Kennedy emphasized the need for farmers and the agricultural industry to be on board with the MAHA agenda. “If we lose the farmers, the MAHA agenda is bankrupt,” he said. “We don’t want to put a single farmer out of business. What we want to do is create incentives and innovation to allow them to innovate themselves, to use less chemical intensive [methods,] but we’re not a nanny state.” Collins also asked Kennedy about the affordability of whole foods compared to less expensive ultraprocessed options. “It’s an illusion to think that processed food is cheap, because you end up paying for it with diabetes, you end up paying for it with autoimmune dysregulation, with mitochondrial dysfunction, with inflammation, and you end up paying much higher costs in the long run,” he said. Kennedy also doubled down on comments during a budget hearing last week, when he said that Americans from him. “They probably shouldn’t take medical advice from any HHS secretary,” he said Thursday. “I’m somebody who is not a physician. But they should also be skeptical about any medical advice. They need to do their own research.” Kennedy pointed to frustrations with medical experts during the Covid-19 pandemic. “I would say, be skeptical of authority. My father told me that when I was a young kid, people in authority lie,” the health secretary said.",

    "content": "Twenty-seven minutes into a town hall with staff last week, US National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya acknowledged that he was going to get into uncomfortable territory. “This one’s a tough one for me,” Bhattacharya told the audience of researchers and other NIH employees gathered in an auditorium at the biomedical research agency’s headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland, last Monday, before introducing one of the most divisive topics in science. “It’s possible that the [Covid-19] pandemic was caused by research conducted by human beings,” he said, according to a video obtained by CNN. “And it’s also possible that the NIH partly sponsored that research. And if that’s true – ” At that point, Bhattacharya paused to watch as dozens of NIH staffers stood and filed out of the auditorium. “It’s nice to have free speech,” he said with a smile. “Welcome, you guys.” Bhattacharya then persisted. “If it’s true that we sponsored research that caused a pandemic – and if you look at polls of the American people, that’s what most people believe, and I looked at the scientific evidence; I believe it – what we have to do is make sure that we do not engage in research that’s any risk of posing any risk to human populations,” he said. The walkout was a gentle protest, one Bhattacharya – a former Stanford professor of health policy and economics who frequently claimed to have been during the Covid-19 pandemic for communicating views in opposition with those held by US scientific leadership at the time – referred to later in the town hall as “silent dissent.” It represented not just disagreement with – and dismay over – Bhattacharya’s assertion that the NIH may bear some responsibility for the pandemic, which more than 7 million people worldwide, by sponsoring so-called gain-of-function research that created the SARS-CoV-2 virus that then leaked from a lab. That’s a view by a large number of expert virologists and epidemiologists, who think it’s more likely the virus emerged via a spillover from animals. It was also a preplanned protest over working conditions; the staffers just chose to leave a little earlier than intended, as Bhattacharya made those comments, some told CNN.  The walkout was designed to communicate frustrations over scientists’ inability to do their jobs under the second Trump administration, they said. “We’d been trying to meet with Dr. Bhattacharya as members of the union to discuss issues we’ve had with working conditions that prevented us from doing our jobs and research,” said Dr. Kaitlyn Hajdarovic, a postdoctoral researcher at NIH. Like others who spoke with CNN, she emphasized that she was speaking in a personal capacity and as a member of a union representing about 5,000 early-career researchers at the NIH. Hajdarovic and others described issues obtaining materials for research because the people who do the purchasing had been dismissed; the firings and rehirings of scientist colleagues; the fear of a proposed 40% cut to the NIH budget; and general chaos and unpredictability that are disruptive to their day-to-day jobs. “We were trying to use this walkout as a way to get a sit-down meeting with Dr. Bhattacharya,” said Dr. Matt Manion, another NIH postdoctoral researcher and union member. “We’ve asked at least twice since he took over the role.” The union members, joined by others at the agency, had planned to leave the town hall at the start of Bhattacharya’s time answering pre-submitted questions, added Dr. Matthew Brown, a third union member and postdoctoral fellow. Bhattacharya and his chief of staff, Seana Cranston, noted several times that about 1,200 questions had been submitted and that they’d chosen the “hard ones” to answer. “Having these sort of preplanned town halls is not a substitute for actually sitting down with scientists who will do the research that improves the health of the American public,” Brown said. In response to CNN’s request for comment, a spokesman for HHS said, “at Monday’s town hall, the NIH Director addressed staff openly and took unscripted questions from the audience. The individuals who walked out had the opportunity to engage directly and voice their concerns constructively. Instead, they chose to walk out, seemingly driven more by political motives because of their dissent with this administration.” Brown countered that the group’s dissent “is based on the tremendous damage that has been done to taxpayer-funded biomedical research over the past four months. Protecting our research into diseases like cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s deserves more than a short question and answer session.” Still, although the walkout was planned for a different reason, the gain-of-function comments didn’t go over well. One NIH scientist tied the comments to a that says the agency will prohibit foreign subaward grants, or research funding arrangements in which a grant recipient passes on some of the funding to foreign collaborators; the White House for fiscal year 2026 cited NIH’s funding of research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology as part of its reasoning for a proposed nearly $18 billion cut to the NIH’s budget. “The notion that you can use the as justification to cancel all foreign subawards is ridiculous,” said the scientist, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal. “They are doing it purely for political and/or ideological reasons. “Whether or not you agree with the theory, foreign subawards support research to prevent the next pandemic,” the scientist added. “Canceling them all at once with little to no warning is asking for another pandemic.” A spokesman for HHS said, “NIH is transitioning from foreign subawards to foreign subprojects to ensure that all recipients of American taxpayer dollars—whether domestic or international—are held to the same rigorous standards of oversight, accountability, and transparency.” There were other points of tension during the town hall, too. At one point, Bhattacharya took a previously submitted question about the NIH’s approach to diversity, equity and inclusion, an issue the Trump administration has targeted, a large number of research grants. “The question is, how should we define health disparities research in a way that clearly separates it from DEI while continuing to address the costly consequences of US health disparities?” Cranston prompted Bhattacharya. Bhattacharya responded that he has, “in my own research, focused on vulnerable populations, and very often that means minority populations.” But, he continued, “there’s been a line of research supported by the NIH that I don’t actually fundamentally believe is scientific, that is ideological in nature.” To provide an example, Bhattacharya cited redlining, or in housing and lending practices. “You could imagine a study looking at the effect of redlining on the access to health care for people, right? That’s a completely legitimate kind of study,” Bhattacharya said. “That would be a, I think, completely legitimate kind of study for the NIH to support.” A member of the audience then spoke up. “Then why is NIH terminating them?” she said. “I’m sorry, the NIH is not terminating those studies,” Bhattacharya responded. “I want to make a distinction –” “Oh, I disagree!” the audience member shot back as colleagues applauded. “Let me finish,” Bhattacharya said. “So the other kind of studies, for instance, what I want to distinguish from is something like ‘structural racism causes poor health in minority populations.’ ” “What do you think redlining is?” the audience member said. “The problem there is that it’s not a scientific hypothesis,” Bhattacharya argued. “You can’t, in principle, think of a way to test that hypothesis where, in principle, you could falsify it.” The director also told NIH staff that he’d arrived in the job the day of mass dismissals as part of the HHS’ Reduction in Force, or RIF, April 1, and that he hadn’t had a say in them. HHS it cut 1,200 employees from the NIH. “I actually don’t have any transparency in how those decisions were made,” Bhattacharya said. “And I was quite upset about that. It would be nice to have had some say.” Bhattacharya said he’s tried to make conditions better since he arrived based on feedback from employees, including by turning purchasing cards back on and enabling travel to conferences. He also suggested that he’d put a stop to a requirement that employees send an each week detailing five things they’d accomplished. “I heard you guys have to do five points every week,” Bhattacharya said. “That was ridiculous. I’m really flat proud that we don’t have to have some of the best scientists in the world tell me what they did last week with five points. That made no sense.” The audience applauded that. And later in the program, Bhattacharya took a few questions from the audience that didn’t appear planned. To one, which was inaudible on the video CNN reviewed, Bhattacharya responded, “No gloves? … That should not be happening. We’ll get that fixed.” A week after the town hall, the union members said they still hadn’t heard from Bhattacharya’s office about scheduling a meeting.",

Kennedy Jr. announced Tuesday said the Covid-19 vaccine will no longer be among the recommended vaccines for pregnant women and healthy children on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s immunization schedule. The immunization schedule posted online had not yet been changed as of Tuesday morning. Kennedy announced the change in a posted to the social media platform X. He was flanked by US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary and National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. “As of today, the Covid vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC recommended immunization schedule,” Kennedy said. “Last year, the Biden administration urged healthy children to get yet another covid shot, despite the lack of any clinical data to support the repeat booster strategy in children.” Pregnant women and children with underlying conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from Covid-19. The recommendation shift comes among other changes to Covid-19 vaccine policy. The FDA said last week it’s overhauling how it approves Covid-19 vaccines, a move that may limit future shots to older Americans and people at higher risk of serious Covid-19 infection.",

    "content": "Tina Knowles remembers growing up in a loving and raucous family of nine. She was the youngest of seven children. Add in her cousins, and they were a force to be reckoned with whenever they left the house. At a very early age, Knowles says she was taught not to draw any attention to herself. “Pretty is as pretty does,” her mom used to say. In other words, be quiet, know your place. Lucky for us all, she didn’t listen. On a book tour for her new memoir, “ ,” an Oprah’s Book Club selection, she talked to me at CNN’s offices in New York about what she learned from her own childhood and her choices while raising her daughters, Beyoncé and Solange Knowles. On Mother’s Day weekend, here’s what the businesswoman, fashion designer and mother of two of the most famous entertainers in the world wanted to share. Teaching kids to be seen and not heard was a common way of parenting back when “Mama Tina” was growing up in Galveston, Texas, during segregation. Her mom, her teachers at her Catholic school and all the adults around her made clear what role she was expected to play. To Knowles, that translated into trying to make herself small and insignificant — even though she was born with a big personality, big feelings and many opinions. But Knowles simply couldn’t follow the quiet rule and was quickly given a nickname: “Badass Tenie B.” “That was not a term of endearment when I was little,” Knowles told me in a recent conversation. “They used to just say, here comes that Badass Tenie B because I was hyper, I talked back.” Now, she says she recognizes her willfulness and hyper behavior stemmed from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or . Which, she reflects, “wasn’t a thing then.” Knowles attended a school where nuns ruled the roost. She said there were teachers who told her she didn’t belong, that she was unsalvageable and a bad seed. The words punctured her soul and made her hate going to school. “They thought they were doing the best thing,” Knowles said, but it hurt terribly. She would run home to tell her mother and could not understand why her mom would never take her side. She didn’t know her mother was working herself to the bone for the church to get Knowles and her siblings an education. From her own experience at school and in her childhood community, Knowles said it’s so important to really think about what you are saying to children. Labels can affect them for a lifetime. “I still fight with that sometimes,” she said, “and I’m 71 years old. It’s in the back of my head: Don’t bring too much attention to yourself. It’s OK if somebody else takes credit for what you did.” Those words still cut, so she advises parents to do things differently. “Advocate for your kids. You have to protect your kids,” Knowles said. “Make sure that the messages that they’re giving your kids are ones that they can do anything they want to do and they do belong anywhere that they want to be.” It’s exactly the message she imparted to her girls. Your children are watching how you treat yourself, Knowles told me, noting that her loving mother, Agnéz Beyincé, lived life in fear for her children as she tried to make sure they were not targets in the segregated US South. But Knowles also watched her mother make exquisite outfits for all of her kids, and they were the best-dressed kids in town even though they were poor. (Knowles learned great lessons from her mother’s work as a seamstress and ended up creating most of the outfits for Destiny’s Child, Beyonce’s singing group with Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams.) “As poor as we were, we were always the sharpest kids and just took a lot of pride in fashion and how we looked and … I think it helped us not to know how poor we were,” Knowles said. “I passed it on to my daughters … they’re very talented at putting things together. They don’t sew like I sew but they can put a button on, and they can put a hem in and take a dart in and that type of thing.” Knowles says she knew right away that Beyoncé had found her life’s passion the first time she saw her daughter onstage. It was that obvious. But Knowles said her younger daughter could have done anything, and she didn’t really want Solange to go into the music business. “I was terrified when Beyoncé turned around 10,” said Knowles, worried she’d lose her children to their craft and that the work would create a wedge between the sisters. According to Knowles, the kids in Beyoncé’s singing group would say to Solange every day, “‘Be quiet, Solange,’ because she would try to choreograph (the group). You know she’s bossy, and she wanted to be involved.” “I started noticing that Beyoncé would allow them to talk to her like that,” she said. “I saw a wall between them coming, and so I got them in therapy.” While her family and community thought therapy could be problematic or even dangerous, she found a “wonderful” child therapist. As a result, the two sisters “are now as close as they can be. No wedge will come between them.” Knowles encourages other parents to do the same if they see an unhealthy sibling rivalry developing between your children. Knowles got diagnosed with breast cancer last year, and she struggled with the decision to mention it publicly or not. She decided to speak out so other people would also get screened, especially if they’ve missed a checkup or two or more. “You get busy doing everything for everyone else,” she said, “and everything else takes a priority over your health at some point in our lives, I think (for) women in particular, but men as well.” “I want to share it in hopes that that women would take a minute and say … I’m gonna go,” she added.",

    "content": ". Hot flashes and night sweats. Light, heavy or skipped periods. Mood swings and brain fog. Sleepless nights. Changes to hair and skin. These can all be symptoms of the , a natural process that a woman goes through as her brain and body wind down and eventually shut off the ability to reproduce. But honest and open discussions about menopause and the years leading up to it — called perimenopause — have, until recently, been nonexistent. Women’s experience  have been either ignored or superficially played out in public for laughs, often resulting in a shroud of secrecy and feelings of shame. Treating menopause as taboo even made the process a mystery to the very people going through it. “When I first started to notice changes in my body, I was probably … 46, 47-ish,” Emmy-award winning comedian and writer Samantha Bee told CNN Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell recently on the podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta. “And I was starting to do my own show. ‘Full Frontal’ had just kind of started, and I was under just … immense amounts of stress, no question. “And I really started to feel like I was not coping well,” she said. “My body was changing — I was having physical changes — and I actually, literally didn’t know what was happening.” Bee, who rose to fame first as a correspondent on “The Daily Show With Jon Stewart” and later with her own series, “Full Frontal With Samantha Bee,” said she would stop getting her period for a couple of months here and there. Her hair also started falling out in a way that didn’t feel typical. And she developed frozen shoulder, started sweating at night and was on an emotional roller coaster with her insides “roiling.” Because the majority of her friends are a little younger than she is, Bee said she thought she was “going crazy” because of her job. She finally confided in her gynecologist that she wasn’t sleeping well and “turning into Lady Macbeth.” “And she was like, ‘Oh, you’re in .’ And I was like, ‘There’s a word?’” Bee recounted, noting that at the time the topic hadn’t really broken the surface of popular culture. “We’re all talking about it now, and you can read about it, and people are like, ‘Yeah!’ But eight years ago: zip, like zero information,” she recalled. “Nobody in the conversation. Not cool. Very unsexy. Mention it and you are just like a witch-crone who lives in a cave, don’t come out. … I would never in a million years have thought, ‘Oh, I’m in perimenopause.’” You can listen to the full episode Bee’s most recent project, “ ,” was born out of her own bewildering experience. She performed her one-woman show in New York City in October 2024, where it was recorded live and adapted for audio by Audible. Having a word and a framework for what she was going through, Bee said, helped put her “on a path of knowledge.” “You’re de-pubertizing,” Bee said. Her doctor had this helpful guidance: “‘Remember all the torment you felt … when you were 15 and … every zit was an operatic tragedy? She was like, ‘That’s what that is, but just in the other direction.’” The No. 1 thing that helped Bee most, she said, “is that you have to find a community of people that you can talk to, even if it’s just one person.” “Just saying the words out loud and  normalizing it. It’s normal. It literally happens to 50% of the population,” she said. “It’s good to make a joke about. It’s good to say  it out loud. That’s actually the main thing that has helped me.” What was not helpful, she said, was turning to social media. “I don’t like to take advice from people who are trying to sell me any type of product. Ever.” Whom did Bee trust? For advice and guidance, in addition to her own doctor, she turned to a woman who has been called “the internet’s gynecologist,” Dr. Jen Gunter. Gunter, who authored the best-selling “ ,” is known for debunking myths about this stage of life. “She told me that some of what happens when you are in perimenopause is that your brain is creating new neural pathways because it’s kind of cleaning itself out,” Bee said. “It’s kind of scrubbing out all of the neural pathways related to getting pregnant, feeding a baby, all of those early childhood, maternal pathways in your brain. It clears a little bit of space so it can be a time of tremendous creativity.” Gunter, who said she likes to call it the “menopause experience” or the “menopause continuum,” agreed that we don’t talk enough about perimenopause and menopause. “If you’ve never heard about it, how would you really know what’s going on with your body?” she told Tirrell on a separate episode of the Chasing Life podcast. You can listen to the full episode “A lot of women get their symptoms dismissed,” she said. “But also, the symptoms can be really nonspecific.” For example, she said, women can have irregular periods, heavy bleeding, hot flashes and brain fog for other reasons. “So, there’s a combination of reasons that a lot of people don’t realize that’s what it is until they’re in the middle of it.” menopause is discussed in the wider culture can also be impactful. “How you talk about something actually changes your thoughts about it,” Gunter pointed out. “It means that we have a mind-body experience,” she said. “Everybody around you is telling you that you’re an ugly old hag whose ‘time has come,’ and all you’re seeing are 70-year-old men dating 20-year-old girls. … You could see how someone would feel worse about maybe the changes happening to their body.” Gunter said we speak in euphemisms about men. “They have ‘erectile dysfunction.’ We don’t say ‘penile failure,’” Gunter said. “If we talked about men’s bodies the way we talked about women’s bodies, , that would be a whole different ball game.” So, what do women need to know about the menopause experience? Here are Gunter’s top five facts. Menopause marks the end of an individual’s reproductive years. The ovaries cease releasing eggs. “This is when ovulation stops,” Gunter said via email. “This means estrogen levels eventually decrease, and production of progesterone stops.” But the progress is not gradual or linear. “Hormones can be chaotic in the time leading up to menopause, which is known as the menopause transition.” Remember the chaos of puberty? “Think of menopause like puberty in reverse,” she said. The at the average age of 45, according to Gunter. “The average age of menopause 51 and the normal range is 45-55.” “This means for some women symptoms may start in their early 40s, but for others there may be no symptoms until their late forties or even early 50s,” she added via email. In other words, everybody is different, which makes it  an unpredictable ride. Gunter explained that an individual reaches the milestone of menopause when she has not had a period for one year. “Menstrual irregularity is normal in the menopause transition, and when people are reliably skipping a period then menopause is likely 1-3   years away,” she said. No blood or urine tests exist that can indicate whether someone is close to menopause, according to Gunter. Blood work isn’t even needed for the diagnosis. “If you are over age 45 and have gone a year without a period, that makes the diagnosis,” she said. But sometimes more testing is required. “Blood work is indicated if someone is younger than age 45 and going 3   months or more between periods. The reason for the testing is to identify the cause of the irregular bleeding, and one cause may be premature menopause (age 40-  44) or primary ovarian insufficiency (under age 40),” she said. For people who don’t get their periods for other reasons — due to using a hormone IUD or having had a hysterectomy — Gunter said doctors go by symptoms other than bleeding, for example hot flashes. Symptoms can vary greatly from person to person, affect many body systems, and start and resolve at different times. “The most  common symptom in the menopause transition is irregular periods, but they can also be heavy,” Gunter said. “Everyone is different. Hot flashes and night sweats are common symptoms,” she noted. “Depression, brain fog and joint pain can happen as well. Vaginal dryness, pain with sex and an increased risk of urinary tract infections are also common concerns.” Menopause also ushers in some physical vulnerabilities. “The risk of osteoporosis increases with menopause. Menopause also marks a time when there is a change in the risk of diabetes and heart disease, so it’s important to be checked for diabetes, have your blood pressure checked and also your cholesterol and lipids,” she said. The best therapies for you will depend on your symptoms and health risks, Gunter said. “ (also known as hormone replacement therapy) is the gold standard for hot flashes and night sweats, and for women who choose this therapy, it should be an FDA-approved product,” she said via email. “Hormone pellets and compounded hormones are not FDA-approved and not recommended    as the dosing is inconsistent and can lead to unnecessary and serious health concerns. “Many women have heard the word bioidentical, but it is a marketing term. That being said, women should know that most hormones approved by the FDA are bioidentical,” she said. Should all women entering menopause be on it? “We do not recommend that every woman take menopause hormone therapy, rather (that)   it be prescribed for specific reasons where we have data to show it works or that is biologically plausible that it could help,” Gunter explained. There are several key lifestyle opportunities as well, Gunter said, such as not smoking and eating a balanced, healthy diet.  She recommends aiming for 25 grams of fiber every day. “It’s also important to do resistance training and do aerobic exercise, as this improves many health domains,” she said, noting, however, that there is no need to go overboard   by, say, running marathons or engaging in competitive weight lifting if you don’t already enjoy these activities. To maintain physical fitness, aging adults can follow the of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity weekly and two days per week of muscle-strengthening activities of moderate intensity. “There are no menopause-specific supplements that have been shown in rigorous studies to help with symptoms. Considering the menopause gold rush, I recommend people steer clear of those who sell supplements    as their content online is almost always geared for sales, not education,” she said. But if a person has a specific health concern, such as low iron or low vitamin D levels, Gunter said in the podcast, a supplement can be of value. Look for one that has been certified by a third party, such as (USP) or the (the National Sanitation Foundation). . CNN Audio’s Grace Walker contributed to this report.",

    "content": "Don’t like having your period? Hormonal birth control can be used for more than just preventing pregnancy — it’s also a popular way to go months or even years without a . Continuous use birth control involves taking hormonal pills without what’s called a placebo week or using other methods such as an implant, ring or injections without a break. This method can end the regular bleeding associated with periods, as well as the cramps, migraines and other symptoms of menstruation. As social media becomes a hotbed for amateur medical advice and personal anecdotes, posts about getting off the pill and preventing pregnancy through nonhormonal methods rake in thousands of views daily on apps like . As influencers share their fears about infertility and the possible harms of suppressing your body’s natural processes, reproductive experts say myths and misinformation about hormonal birth control are on the rise. To understand more about the risks, rewards and science behind using birth control to forego menstruation, I had a chat with reproductive health expert Dr. Kavita Nanda. As an obstetrician-gynecologist and clinical researcher for the North Carolina-based human development nonprofit FHI 360, Nanda has spent over 25 years studying continuous use birth control and other forms of contraception. Combined contraceptives use synthetic forms of estrogen and progesterone together. Combination methods work to prevent pregnancy by preventing ovulation, which is the release of an egg from the ovaries. Other methods use synthetic progesterone only, including pills, implants, injectables and intrauterine devices, or IUDs. Both combined and progestin-only methods make the mucus in your cervix thicker, which makes it hard for sperm to enter the uterus, and the lining of your uterus also remains thin. The standard way to take combined contraceptives is cyclically, every day for three weeks, and then you have a break in the hormones for a week. You either don’t take a pill, or you take a placebo for a week, so you have what’s called a withdrawal bleed. The lining of the uterus sheds, and that’s what people call a “period,” although it’s really just a hormone-free withdrawal bleed. But when we talk about continuous use, you don’t take any breaks. The uterine lining stays thin and intact, and this means that users can go weeks, months or even longer, without a “period.” There have been comparing continuous versus cyclical use, and it’s just as effective and just as safe. There’s no medical reason to have a period or withdrawal bleed when you’re on hormonal contraceptives. As long as you don’t have any contraindications (medical conditions) for the birth control pill, you don’t have contraindications for the continuous use of the pill. Historically, before contraception, women didn’t necessarily bleed all the time, because a lot of time was spent either being pregnant or breastfeeding. In both of those conditions, there’s no monthly bleeding, often for months. Now, if you’re not pregnant or breastfeeding, you’re not on hormonal contraception, and you don’t have a monthly period — that’s something you do need to discuss with your provider, because that could signal an issue. The side effects in general are similar to those with cyclical use. For example, you might have nausea, breast tenderness and headaches (at any time). With continuous use, some people experience unexpected breakthrough bleeding or spotting, especially initially, but this usually improves over time, and many people do achieve amenorrhea or (the) cessation of menses. For some people, it may take three to four months. There’s no evidence that long-term use of hormonal contraception — whether it’s combined hormonal interception, taken continuously or cyclically — causes infertility, and fertility typically returns within a month or two. Basically, once you stop, the (synthetic) hormones go away very quickly from the blood, ovulation is no longer suppressed, your normal estrogen and progesterone production resume. Assuming that you had normal menstrual cycles before, they would resume. (One exception is) if you’re taking something like the . It doesn’t cause infertility, but it may take longer for fertility to return after injections. When the combined oral contraceptive pill was developed in the 1950s, the now-standard 21 days of active pills followed by a seven-day hormone-free interval was not based on medical necessity, but rather on cultural and strategic reasons. At the time, there was a widely held belief that menstruating every 28 days was a sign of normal female reproductive function. To align with that expectation, the regimen was designed to mimic a natural menstrual cycle, with a monthly withdrawal bleed intended to reassure both users and physicians that they were not pregnant — important in an era before home pregnancy tests were readily available — and, at the time, to help ease religious and societal resistance to contraception. It’s really a personal preference and a discussion between a person and their provider. Someone might not want to have a period for years, or some people prefer to bleed three times a year. Some people feel reassured by monthly bleeding. Continuous use may be especially helpful for people who have painful periods, heavy periods, endometriosis, migraines, iron-deficiency anemia, physical or intellectual disabilities, and transgender individuals.",

An happen every year in the United States — an average of 11 drowning deaths per day — according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Drowning is the leading cause of death in children ages 1 to 4, and after motor vehicle accidents, it is the second leading cause of death attributed to unintentional injuries among kids ages 5 to 14. I wanted to speak more about water safety with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University who previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner. She is also the mother of two young children, and as someone who learned to swim as an adult, she is a passionate advocate for kids — and adults — learning to swim. The CDC issued an in 2024 about unintentional drowning deaths in the United States. Death rates were significantly higher in 2020, 2021 and 2022 than in 2019, according to the agency. Moreover, the highest rates were seen in young children ages 1 to 4. Among children in this age group, 461 died by drowning in 2022, an increase of 28% from 2019. The report also highlighted racial disparities, with higher rates of drowning deaths among individuals identified as non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native and as non-Hispanic Black or African American. Only 45% of all adults reported having had swim lessons, and those numbers were higher among White Americans (52%) than among Black (37%) and Hispanic (28%) Americans. Racial disparities were also reported in a 2023 analysis from the , which found that African American children made up 21% of all drownings for kids younger than age 15 in which race and ethnicity are known. Among kids ages 5 to 14, 45% of drowning deaths occurred among African Americans. The CPSC analysis also contained another key data point: The vast majority (80%) of pediatric drownings in which the setting is known occurred at a residence. This means that 4 in 5 kids who drowned died in their own backyard pool or that of a friend, neighbor or family member. Of these residential drownings, 91% occurred among kids younger than 7 years old. One major reason is the difference in supervision. Many public beaches and community pools hire lifeguards whose job is to watch out for the safety of everyone in or near the water. Private pools in people’s yards often don’t have someone designated for this purpose. Sometimes older children are supervising younger children but aren’t always watching. Or adults may be supervising, but they are also busy with other tasks. In addition, some of those watching others may not know how to swim themselves. There may also be a false sense of security in residential settings. People may think the pool is small or not that deep or there are a lot of people around, so what can happen? Keep in mind, though, that small kids can drown in just inches of water. Serious injury or death can happen within . Drownings are often silent because the victim is unable to call out for help. The single most important best practice is to never leave children unsupervised near a body of water. Even if they already know how to swim, even if they are wearing a flotation device, even if the pool is shallow or small, an accident could occur — and either you or another responsible adult should always be able to see your child. The supervising adult should be actively watching the child and not distracted by chores or their smartphone. That person also should not be under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The adult who’s responsible must also know how to swim well enough so they are able to jump into the pool and save the child if necessary. An additional safety precaution is and first aid for infants, children and adults, which you can do through the American Red Cross. If you have a pool, be very careful before allowing others to use it. If your neighbors’ children want to swim in your pool, a responsible adult must accompany them. Private swimming pools should all have childproof fencing around them. The fencing should the pool, have a self-close latch out of the reach of children and be at least 4 feet high. This is required by law in most states. Always wear a properly fitted, US Coast Guard–approved life jacket when boating. Of all the people who drowned while boating in 2022, , according to the CDC. To be safe, swim in areas where a lifeguard is on duty. Always about safety conditions, and stay in the area designated for swimming. Yes. Kids ages 1 to 4 who took part in formal swim lessons had an 88% lower risk of drowning, according to a study in . The goal here isn’t necessarily to teach kids all the different strokes and get them to join a swim team; it’s to impart basic lifesaving skills, such as treading water and floating on their back. When you are in the water with your children, take every opportunity to remind them about water safety. Other tips include never swimming alone, always asking for permission before entering the water and never diving into unknown bodies of water headfirst. Young children should also be reminded not to reach for items in the pool, as they are at risk of falling in; they should always ask for help instead. Yes. First, adults who don’t know how to swim are more likely to have . This was the case for me. My parents didn’t swim, and I also never learned swimming growing up. Second, it’s hard for adults to properly supervise children swimming if they can’t swim themselves. It was actually a terrifying experience with my own children that prompted me to learn to swim. My children were just 1 year and 3 years old one summer when my older kid pushed the younger one into the pool. We were at our local community pool, and there was a lifeguard who immediately sprang into action. But I remember how terrified I felt — and how helpless. I enrolled my kids in swim lessons right away. I also found an instructor to teach me, too, because I realized I had to overcome my own fear of the water and learn basic water safety skills to protect my kids. Learning how to swim as an adult is a humbling experience, especially for people like me who had to first start with overcoming fear. I began literally from zero. For weeks, I worked on just getting comfortable submerging my head underwater. Eventually, I learned how to swim and now really enjoy being in the water. And I feel a lot more comfortable supervising my children when we are in private or community swimming spaces. I’m looking forward to our local pool opening for the summer and to spending time with my kids having a fun — and safe — time in the water.",

    "content": "Only one fourth of sunscreens on store shelves in the United States deliver safe and effective protection against the harmful rays of the sun, which analyzed more than 2,200 sunscreens available for purchase in 2025. “Our criteria include the ability of the sunscreen’s active ingredients to provide balanced protection against both UVA and UVB rays, as well as any hazardous chemical ingredients in the product,” said David Andrews, acting chief science officer at the Environmental Working Group, or EWG, a consumer organization that has produced the annual sunscreen guide since 2007. Released May 20, the lists the best , including those with the best “ ;” highly rated including moisturizers with SPF; the best with SPF; and the top designed for outdoor activities such as sports or spending time at the beach. “There are nearly 500 products we are recommending consumers seek out as their first option,” Andrews said. “We want people to wear sunscreen and at the same time recognize there are as well — seeking shade, wearing wide-brimmed hats, lightweight long-sleeve shirts and pants and covering up your feet are very effective ways, especially if you’re concerned about sunscreen ingredients.” Choosing not to protect your skin from the sun, an idea should not be an option, according to Dr. Kathleen Suozzi, a dermatologic surgeon at Yale School of Medicine. “Extensive research has shown that UV radiation from the sun is a significant cause of skin cancers such as melanoma. It’s really indisputable at this point,” Suozzi told CNN in a prior interview. “UV radiation has both UVA and UVB, and we know that both of them damage the DNA in skin cells.” Sunscreens come in two types, chemical and mineral. Chemical sunscreens are designed to soak into the skin as a chemical reaction absorbs ultraviolet radiation as energy and disperses it as heat. Testing released in 2019 by the US Food and Drug Administration found seven chemical ingredients — avobenzone, oxybenzone, octocrylene, ecamsule, homosalate, octisalate, and octinoxate — were absorbed from the skin into the bloodstream The concentration of the seven chemicals in the blood increased each day after application and remained above FDA safety levels a week later. Two of the chemicals — homosalate and oxybenzone — were still above safety thresholds at day 21. Once in the bloodstream, these chemicals can enter , threatening coral reefs and aquatic life. Due to the increasing devastation of their coral reefs, ; ; the ; ; ; and an island in the Pacific, have banned the use of several chemical sunscreens, particularly oxybenzone. Oxybenzone has also been linked to lower in adolescent boys, in men, and in babies. However, the use of oxybenzone use has fallen dramatically, according to EWG’s . Once in 70% of non-mineral sunscreens, oxybenzone is now in only 9% of products, Andrews said. The Personal Care Products Council, which represents sunscreen manufacturers, disagreed with the report’s findings. “This report sows consumer confusion and poses a serious risk by undermining public trust in products that are scientifically proven, rigorously tested, and highly effective at protecting against harmful UV radiation,” said PCPC chief scientists and executive vice president of science, Alexandra Kowcz, in an email. Mineral-based sunscreens work differently. Instead of being absorbed into the skin, the minerals physically deflect and block the sun’s rays. Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are the two FDA-approved mineral sunscreen ingredients, and they do not appear to harm marine ecosystems, Andrews said. “Of the 2,217 products we tested for this year’s report, 43% use zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, up from just 17% in 2007,” Andrews said. “That’s good news for consumers and the environment.” However, some mineral products may contain chemical “boosters” designed to artificially raise the sun protection factor (SPF), the report said. “Using chemical boosters may result in a lower concentration of active mineral ingredients at the expenses of consumer safety,” Andrews said. “We want to ensure these sunscreens are providing the SPF advertised on their labels as well as balanced UVA and UVB protection. Some of these boosters, such as the solvent , absorb UV rays much like chemical sunscreen ingredients, Andrews said. “Yet they’re marketed primarily as solvents that improve how a product feels on the skin and reduce the white cast that mineral sunscreens can leave behind,” he said. “BOS is structurally similar to octisalate, one of 12 chemical sunscreen ingredients the FDA has identified as needing more safety data,” Andrews added. “However, BOS is not regulated as an active ingredient and hasn’t undergone the same level of safety evaluation.” EWG first raised concerns about SPF boosters in an to then–FDA Commissioner Robert Califf, urging the agency to investigate “sunscreen ingredients that may enable manufacturers to advertise higher SPF values for their over-the-counter sunscreen products without offering users truly enhanced protection from UVA and UVB rays.” The agency should also investigate any correlation “between protection from skin reddening, immunosuppression, long-term skin damage and cancer,” the letter said. To date, no action has been taken by the FDA, Andrews said. The FDA proposed for sunscreen safety in 2019. Industry was asked to provide additional testing on 12 sunscreen chemicals of concern, including the seven which FDA testing showed are easily absorbed into the bloodstream. That has yet to be done, Andrews said. The FDA proposal also asked manufacturers to test spray sunscreen products to prove aerosolized chemicals cannot be inhaled into the deep lung — that testing has also not occurred, he said. “When the FDA tested aerosol cosmetics a few years ago, they found some products did have very small particle sizes that could be inhaled in the deep lung and lead to possible health harms,” Andrews said. “The same concern applies to spray sunscreens.” According to the , inhalation of such particles can cause serious health effects in individuals at greatest risk, such as “people with heart or lung disease, people with diabetes, older adults and children (up to 18 years of age).” Yet aerosol sunscreens remain popular among consumers — 26% of the sunscreens tested were sprays — despite potential inhalation risks and the difficulty of providing even and adequate coverage with a spray, Andrews said. “An found that even under light breeze conditions of say, 6- to 10-miles-an-hour, a significant portion of an aerosol sunscreen just blows away,” he said. “I was at a soccer game last weekend, and when someone sprayed sunscreen, I felt like it went over the entire field. I’m not convinced they got any sunscreen on themselves.” The FDA also called for a cap of 60 SPF on sunscreen products in the 2019 proposal, saying any benefit over 60 is extremely minor. Therefore labeling sunscreens at levels higher than 60 SPF could be misleading consumers by providing a false sense of sun protection, the FDA said. That too, has not been accomplished, and consumers continue to spend money on these products, Andrews said. “One of the primary drivers of consumer purchasing is the highest SPF number possible,” he said. “Consumers are not getting the message that higher SPF values don’t offer a clear benefit.” CNN reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA, for comment but did not hear back before publication.",

    "title": "\n      Parents need to talk to their tweens sooner about puberty\n    ",

    "content": ". For many parents, the idea of having “the talk” with their kids may be daunting, making them feel embarrassed or squeamish. But many parents are conflating the classic growing-up talk about sex with another crucial conversation they should be having, new research suggests. The talk in question should happen earlier than one may think, and it’s not necessarily about sex. It’s about puberty. About 41% of parents reported they approached talking with their child about puberty only when prompted by the child, according to a new C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital National Poll on Children’s Health released on Monday. Only 36% of parents think it’s best to start puberty conversations before age 10, according to the poll, although puberty has been starting earlier. The poll’s researchers focused on why many preteens and tweens are unprepared for the changes that they experience during puberty. “Our thinking was, how much of that (lack of preparation) might be due to how their parents are approaching the task of talking with them, helping prepare them for puberty,” said Sarah Clark, codirector of the poll and a research scientist in the department of pediatrics at the University of Michigan ﻿in Ann Arbor. “When we’re talking about these younger kids, 7, 8, 9, maybe even 10, as they’re just getting started with puberty, they don’t necessarily need the sex talk,” said Clark, noting that tweens and teens need a conversation about what is or will soon happen with their body and emotions. “We all tend to be a little calmer, a little less anxious, and deal with things better when we know what to expect,” she added. The Mott Poll, which was conducted in February 2025, surveyed 911 parents with at least one child ages 7–12 to understand how parents approach conversations about puberty. The margin of error is plus or minus 2 to 5 percentage points. While many parents said they only talked with their child about puberty only when their child brought it up, Clark explained that this could lead to confusion and anxiety in children, especially if they feel their parents haven’t prepared them. Kids who develop early may become anxious not understanding changes in themselves, and ﻿late-developing kids may see some changes in their classmates and wonder, “what’s wrong with me?” Instead of parents waiting until asked by the child, Clark suggested giving your child information in bits and pieces over time “to help your kid get the concept that these changes are going to happen. They are normal.” And while nearly half of parents said they felt “very confident” in recognizing signs of puberty in their children, Clark said, “parents might be a little overconfident. Some of those first changes are subtle” — like hair growing and voices changing — and parents can’t actually see the hormonal or emotional changes. Today’s children are exposed to a flood of information — and misinformation — from online sources and their peers. Without parental guidance, children may turn to social media or their peers for answers at a time when kids may be confused and potentially self-conscious. “Not talking to them just can leave them in a little bit of a vulnerable position,” Clark said. “A lot of the norms on what was shown or talked about on TV were really different (when parents were kids) than they are today,” Clark said. “Back then, parents could maybe feel like they could protect their kid or avoid certain topics — or avoid their kid from encountering certain topics.” That’s no longer the case. Because kids can learn or hear about all sorts of topics at very young ages, parents have to be “a little more proactive,” to get ahead of the child absorbing confusing, inaccurate or harmful information, Clark said. The poll found that only 31% of parents said they had received an adequate puberty education from their own parents growing up. That means many parents, without a model of how to discuss sensitive developmental changes, often default to the avoidance method they received as children. But today’s parents don’t actually need to have all the answers, Clark and other experts say. Parents just need to start having the conversation. About 44% of parents reported in the poll that they have not gotten any information on how to talk about puberty, but that doesn’t mean parents can’t find straightforward help. Parents should choose a quiet, one-on-one setting — a walk, a car ride or after a younger sibling goes to bed — and leave discomfort out of it, psychiatrist suggested. “Present the information in a matter-of-fact way,” advised Chaudhary, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School and chief medical officer at Modern Health, via email. “It’s important that the child knows they are not alone in this experience — that it’s a universal change. Offer the space for them to ask questions … and check in later.” Don’t wait until your child hits a growth spurt or need to use deodorant. Begin the conversation in elementary school, with basic, age-appropriate information. You can use light-hearted, teachable moments, like a movie scene or a health class unit as openings, or you can share your own experiences. “Make it kind of funny and not so intense, not so scary,” Clark suggested. “If you talk about puberty early, your child will know that the physical changes they are about to go through are normal, and something that happens to everyone,” Chaudhary said. “They might also have a chance to develop some healthy coping skills that they can practice and strengthen before their emotions start to fluctuate as a result of hormonal shifts. “If you’re waiting until middle school, it’s likely too late. By then your child might either be caught off guard by unexpected changes in their body or how they feel, or they might be noticing those changes in their friends already.” Healthy, inviting communication needs to be ongoing, both Clark and Chaudhary emphasized. Kids should not be left guessing about the changes happening to them, but rather feel they have parental guidance supporting them along the way. “You want to leave the door open so kids know they can come to you,” she said. Even if you don’t know the answer, you can learn together and foster a healthy environment.",

    "content": "Do you walk around resenting your partner? Do you dread coming home from work as much as, if not more than, going to work? Are you too tired for date night, much less the sex that might follow? When you think of the future, does it feel like it’s just going to be more of the same? Those can all be signs of relationship burnout, and it’s possible you’ve got it. Most therapists deal with patients who are either burned out or burning out: exhausted, stressed, feeling cynical and even indifferent. As a couples therapist, I’m increasingly seeing clients who are experiencing relationship burnout. These couples are similarly stressed out and exhausted with all the demands at home, but they also resent their partners, feel a sense of growing incompatibility, only see a future where nothing is going to change or have stopped believing in the future with their partner. When I talk to couples, many don’t understand that they can get burned out from their relationships the same as they can from their jobs. And just as you can recover from burnout in your job, you can also recover from it in your relationship — or move on from a situation that’s no longer healthy for you. I consulted some colleagues for their insight into the causes of relationship burnout — and how couples can address it. Intimate relationships need care and feeding, just like friendships do. “Relationship burnout is a state of emotional exhaustion that develops when the pressures and demands of maintaining a relationship outweigh the resources and support available to nurture it,” Rachel Needle, a licensed psychologist and codirector of Modern Sex Therapy Institutes, told me. Burnout doesn’t just affect couples emotionally. It can also have a profound impact on sex and intimacy, said New York City-based psychotherapist Eva Dillon: “When one or both individuals are experiencing emotional or mental exhaustion, it often leads to emotional withdrawal, decreased libido, and a decline in both intimacy and sexual activity.” Several factors can contribute to relationship burnout, from an unequal division of labor at home (one partner has more household responsibilities), lack of work-life balance (one or both partners feel burned out at work), family stressors (conflicts with parents or in-laws), lack of growth as a couple (falling into repetitive routines) and boredom (sexually or emotionally). “It doesn’t usually come from a single rupture or acute crisis,” said Needle, who is based in West Palm Beach, Florida. “It’s the slow accumulation and gradual wear and tear of unmet needs, unresolved conflicts, chronic stressors, and ongoing disconnection.” Here, Needle, Dillon and other experts offer advice for couples to cope with burnout and reenergize their relationship. Recognizing that the relationship has gotten to a state of burnout is the first step, according to sexologist and sex educator Yvonne Kristin Fulbright — who said the key is to do so without blaming or criticizing each other. “Own your statements by saying, ‘I’ve noticed’ or ‘I feel’ and ask how your partner has been feeling about things,” said Fulbright, who is based in Iceland. “Have an honest heart-to-heart about the stressors and frustrations so that each person has a chance to share without interruption.” Part of burnout can include blaming each other and not being accountable for the state of things. “With relationship burnout, partners often think the solution is for their partner to change,” said Eric Rosenblum, a licensed marriage and family therapist in New York City. “But the best way through is to consider your own role in the dynamic and reflect on how you can personally transform to help the relationship evolve.” Some of this work can even happen on your own, without your partner, said New York City sex therapist Rebecca Sokoll. “Try writing down the moments when your negative feelings or thoughts are pointing at your partner,” Sokoll said by email. “Next, see if you can turn your gaze to the other side of the concern, which is your contribution, how you’ve collaborated with your partner in co-creating the problem. Write this down too. You don’t have to show it to anybody — just see how it feels to write it down.” Burnout often worsens because couples ignore issues until they feel overwhelmed. Set aside some time each week to check in with your partner. “Have a two-way conversation about your desire to improve the relationship where you can both have input,” Sokoll suggested. “Listen to each other’s needs and look for small changes you can both agree on. This shouldn’t be a one-time conversation,   but an ongoing one.” The prospect of discussing serious issues can feel stressful, but communication can help you feel more relaxed, according to Dillon. “Sharing with your partner that you are struggling can help regulate the nervous system and create an opening for connection,” she said. “From there, you can engage in small but powerful acts that further soothe the nervous system: a six-second kiss, an extended embrace, a walk outdoors, cuddling, reading aloud or sexual intimacy.” Prioritizing couple time is crucial for preventing burnout. Protect this time and schedule it just as you would an important appointment or work meeting. Needle recommends focusing on novel experiences — such as trying a new class together, going on a hike or even just cooking a new recipe — to reignite connection and excitement. Novelty and playfulness can also help you connect in a way that doesn’t feel like work, Sokoll said. “Put your phones in another room with the ringers off and play a game or do something silly together,” she said. And there’s a bonus: “The playful self is often connected to the sexual self, so this can help burned-out couples reconnect sexually, too.” When you share your life with your partner — financially, as parents, as roommates — it can be easy to miss out on alone time and self-reflection, both of which are necessary to protect against burnout. “At the end of the day, you need to deal with individual burnout to help address relationship burnout,” Fulbright said. Consider ways to rejuvenate yourself independently — a workout routine, quality sleep, yoga, meditation, hobbies — and encourage each other in your self-care efforts. “In revitalizing yourself, you’ll cultivate the energy needed to take on relationship matters.” When it comes to addressing your relationship, you don’t have to go it alone. Seeking professional help with a couples therapist or sex therapist can provide strategies to manage burnout and reconnect emotionally and sexually, especially if you feel you need a neutral party or mediator to guide you through the process. There’s no need to wait: “Working with a therapist when burnout first appears can help reset dynamics before deeper damage occurs,” Needle said. Addressing burnout is crucial for maintaining a healthy and fulfilling relationship — and it’s about moving from patterns of disconnection to patterns of intentional reconnection. By recognizing the signs and taking proactive steps, couples can work toward restoring intimacy and connection. .",

    "content": "Tyrone Marsh felt a void in his life. He was in his 40s and married with two kids. A self-described extrovert, he socialized often. But living in New York after years of moving around, he realized his existing relationships lacked a certain level of depth. His conversations with other men tended to revolve around sports or romantic pursuits, and he longed for more substance. In other words, he wanted real friends. In 2018, in search of connection, he came across a Meetup group that he thought was a book club. It was something else entirely: The ManKind Project, an organization offering intensive retreats and support groups to help men improve their relationships with themselves and others. Intrigued, Marsh decided to join one of the organization’s men’s circles, or structured spaces in which men gather regularly to talk. At his first meeting, he found what he had been missing all his life. “I can sit there with this group of men and fumble through whatever these thoughts are that I’m having,” he says. “And those men hold the space for me and ask questions, and I don’t feel like I’m being judged.” Marsh’s quest for connection underscores a major challenge that many men currently face. While men and women alike are experiencing a rise in , men — a trend that scholars and researchers warn has serious implications. Socially isolated men are for their wives and girlfriends; they’re falling prey to an ; and in severe cases, they face of depression, suicide and domestic violence. At a time when some men are finding community in toxic parts of the “ ,” men’s circles offer another, more positive model of masculinity. Experts say there’s a growing appetite for these groups across the US, UK, Canada and Australia — and Marsh and others who participate in them say they’re challenging deeply entrenched ideas about what it means to be a man. Through years of participation in men’s circles, Marsh — who is currently ManKind Project USA’s co-chair for intercultural competence and belonging — has built a network of close friends he can rely on. That, in turn, has taught him a lot about himself. Now if he’s unsure about something at work, he admits it, instead of spiraling internally about not being good enough. He lets himself cry in front of his children so they know it’s okay to show emotion. He makes an effort to think before he speaks. “We’re taught as men to suppress our feelings, to just do it by ourselves, man up and be strong. I know for me, that was isolating,” he says. “These circles flip the script.” We’re taught as men to suppress our feelings, to just do it by ourselves, man up and be strong. I know for me, that was isolating. Tyrone Marsh Men’s circles run by trained facilitators tend to follow a similar structure. First, the facilitator sets some ground rules for the meeting. Attendees then introduce themselves and check in with each other about how they’re feeling. They might engage in another icebreaker before eventually sharing what’s going on in their lives, discussing everything from relationship issues and career challenges to a health crisis. The men take turns listening to each other and offer each other feedback. Finally, the meeting closes with some takeaways, or perhaps just acknowledgement or gratitude for what was just accomplished. These gatherings can help men strengthen social skills and their relationships with other men, says Pasco Ashton, co-founder and executive director of the UK-based organization Men’s Circle. “Men don’t really have the tools,” he says. “They haven’t learned the same tools that I think women do in social situations: to have the small talk, to connect deeper emotionally, all the emotional intelligence that is part of what we practice.” That realization is what led Ashton to start a men’s circle in 2020. He felt helpless after losing two friends to suicide. He also wanted to work on himself after conversations with female friends about #MeToo. And generally, he felt lonely and unable to confide in most of his male friends. That gathering of a few friends in a London park eventually grew into a larger organization spanning across the UK, with some participants in Europe and the US. His organization also offers workshops, retreats and more casual meetups. Ashton says that while many men who attend circles come looking for social connection, they leave with much more: In an informal survey conducted by his organization, participants reported gaining mutual support and life perspective, as well as improvements in their emotional regulation, self-awareness and other key skills. The reason so many men seem to lack deep connections isn’t because of some innate biological difference, says Niobe Way, author of “Rebels with a Cause: Reimagining Boys, Ourselves, and Our Culture.” Rather, it’s a culture problem. In studying adolescent development for more than four decades, she’s found that boys do want intimate friendships. But as they get older, the pressure to man up results in what Way calls a crisis of connection. Marsh felt that acutely growing up. He was raised in the inner city of Nashville with an incarcerated father and an abusive stepfather, in a home where “there was no such thing as emotional intelligence.” Any hint of perceived softness was met with harsh discipline, treated as something to be stamped out. Marsh tried to model another way for his two children, letting them know their feelings were valid and that their voices deserved to be heard. But some ingrained ideas proved hard to shake. Before Marsh started attending men’s circles, his son Kapila, 20, says he felt that he and his older sister were sometimes held to a different standard when it came to showing emotion. “At times, my emotions were valued, but her emotions were 100% of the time valued,” he says. “For me, there needed to be an extra step of ‘This is how you’re feeling, but what are you going to do with this?’ rather than ‘This is how you’re feeling’ and being able to sit back.” Kapila says he internalized that pressure growing up, feeling like he needed to prove himself to be taken seriously. But he started to notice changes in his father once he got involved with the ManKind Project. Marsh began asking his son more open-ended questions, trying to get to the root of why he felt a particular way. It took Kapila some adjusting to — he was used to following his dad’s advice, and it felt like his dad wasn’t interested in giving it anymore. Kapila now realizes that his dad was training him to trust his intuition and move through the world on his own. In Kapila’s eyes, it made him a better parent. Rick Fortier, 63, has felt the crisis of connection, too. For most of his life, he says he felt safer around his female friends. “I’d always had a feeling of being judged walking on eggshells around other men most of my life: Was I saying the right thing? Were they doing the right thing? Was I man enough?” he says. I’d always had a feeling of being judged walking on eggshells around other men most of my life: Was I saying the right thing? Were they doing the right thing? Was I man enough? Rick Fortier His first experience in a men’s circle challenged those norms. The environment was open and nonjudgmental, and the attendees pushed each other to be honest and authentic. And though it took some trial and error to find a circle that felt like the right fit, Fortier says his current group — which he’s been attending for eight years — is helping him figure out the kind of man he wants to be. The six or so members meet biweekly, and the issues that come up run the gamut: They talk about negative self-image, romantic challenges and the pressures they feel as men to act a certain way. Two members passed away in the last year, so feelings around death have also become a major topic of discussion. “It’s deep in our soul to have a brotherhood, and we don’t know how to do that in our society other than through sporting events, drinking, going hunting or whatever might be typical of accepted men’s behavior,” he says. Even as men commit to improving themselves, they don’t always get it right. As Ian McElroy wrote in 2021 for , “these groups are still run by men, men with all their baggage and acculturation and gazes.” Plenty of groups end up reinforcing stereotypical ideas about who men should be, says Angelica Ferrara, a developmental and social psychologist whose research focuses on masculinity and gender. “Some men’s groups work by saying that a ‘real’ man is emotionally vulnerable and a provider not just through finances, but through emotional support to others,” she wrote in an email to CNN. “These frameworks still imbue men with value (and status in other men’s ideas) solely on what they provide to others—that’s a big problem.” The ManKind Project and also lean on initiation rituals and specific archetypes to help men get in touch with themselves — stemming from their roots in the “mythopoetic” men’s movement, which in the ‘80s and ‘90s brought men into the woods to through drumming circles and chanting. The ManKind Project’s circles, for example, use the labels “king,” “warrior,” “magician” and “lover” (an apparent reference to Robert Moore and Douglas Gillette’s that defines four essential aspects of manhood). Its weekend retreats, which involve cold showers and blindfolding, invoke mythologist Joseph Campbell’s “hero’s journey.” While Marsh and others have found these frameworks empowering and transformative, some note that they can present an outdated and limiting view of masculinity. Still, Ferrara says it’s important not to let perfect be the enemy of good. The most promising men’s circles, in her view, “explicitly name patriarchy and stringent ideas of masculinity as the root of men’s suffering, rather than something to be reconfigured or revived.” But even if Ferrara sees flaws in some of their approaches, men building emotional intelligence and deeper community stands to benefit them and everyone in their lives — and she hopes that as a result, more men might start to question traditional ideas around masculinity altogether. Since President Donald Trump was said to have leveraged corners of the to help him win the 2024 US election, there’s been a lot of discussion about the resurgence of more problematic ideas around masculinity. The recent Netflix series “ ” also sparked conversations about the pressures that boys face to adhere to certain norms. In particular, many younger men seem adrift and more drawn to macho, traditional models of being a man. With on their social media feeds promoting self-improvement through extreme workout and diet regimens, the idea of sitting in a circle and talking about feelings might sound less appealing. It’s a major challenge men’s circles are up against: They’re not reaching the people who might need them most. In their current iteration, men’s circles and similar programs typically attract men in midlife. The ManKind Project does run a specialized version of its flagship retreat for men 18 to 35 (that also costs $995 to attend), and the organization says its overall age range has widened over time — still, Marsh says it struggles with getting younger men involved. Knowing the difference men’s circles made for him, Fortier says he’s frustrated that so few young men seem interested. At 63, he’s one of the younger men in his current group. Over the years, he says some guys have shown up eager to discuss current affairs or sports. When encouraged to dig a little deeper, he says they seemed uncomfortable and often didn’t return. Dismantling generations of preconceptions about men is a daunting task, and men’s circles are just one intervention in the broader project of reconsidering what it means to be a man. But whether through men’s circles or something else, Fortier says men need to step up and take accountability. “We’ve created this situation,” he says. “It’s up to us to fix it.”",

    "content": "Electric guitar swells in the background as a podcaster in a black shirt over his tattoos turns to speak directly to the camera. “I want you to write 10 things that you would love for your spouse or partner to do,” he says. “Here is a roadmap to my chest, to my heart. Then ask them, ‘Will you give me yours?’” This podcaster’s name is Dr. John Delony, and he hosts a show on conservative financial guru Dave Ramsey’s network, Ramsey Solutions. It’s where he talks about mental health and gives advice to listeners who call in with problems that include repairing a marriage after infidelity, reconciling two sisters’ opposing stances on abortion –– and sometimes wilder topics, such as if a caller should leave their family for their best friend’s wife. Many times, callers begin their stories with, “I’ve never told anyone this before.” With 1.2 million subscribers on YouTube, 1.5 million followers on Instagram and three books, Delony’s approach to talking about vulnerable things appears to be resonating with many people. His callers represent a wide variety of people –– men, women, conservative Christians, truck drivers, veterans, police officers and farmers –– many of whom often heavily feel the stigma of struggling with mental health, being vulnerable and asking for help. Part of why he works is that Delony doesn’t fit the mental health counselor stereotype of someone in soft tones asking ‘how does that make you feel,’ which is just a stereotype, said David Kessler, a death and grieving expert, author and one-time guest on Delony’s show. Delony has a balance of presenting like the credentialed mental health professional he is and the good buddy who just wants to hear you out and offer a little guidance, Kessler added, which is what a lot of people are looking for. Health officials have said the United States is facing a , and in 2023, nearly around the world reported feeling fairly or very lonely. Podcasts are not a replacement for therapy with a trained professional, and listeners should be aware that content around mental health can often be oversimplified, said Dr. Frank Sileo, a psychologist based in Ridgewood, New Jersey. But platforms like Delony’s can provide benefit, he added. “Listening to a podcast may be the first important step of a person’s mental health journey,” Sileo added. “Podcasts that focus on mental health issues can provide a wonderful forum for people to learn about all things mental health.” Delony’s combination of a traditionally masculine appearance and open approach — along with his doctorate in counselor education and supervision –– might be one step toward connecting people in need with the tools and resources for better well-being. In a backstage Q&A at Atlanta’s Fox Theater for Delony and Ramsey’s the two men gave a teasing smile to an audience member who introduced herself as Rachel from California before asking a question. “Oh yes, we know you, Rachel,” they said in mock annoyance, like old friends. Rachel Guerrero traveled from California for 10 shows this tour, and she is going to the next shows in Fort Worth, Texas; Kansas City, Missouri; and Phoenix, she said. “Being a single mom, it’s not easy,” Guerrero told CNN. “When I listen to his show and what he talks about, it’s a caller that’s something totally different, but it applies to me.” How can she afford all those trips, you ask? She credits Dave Ramsey’s advice with her financial success. Her feeling was common among audience members. They said they could trust Delony because he was connected to Ramsey and his Christian-based teaching. But they also say he knows what he was talking about because he had been through it himself, and that he just says it like it is. Accruing this following wasn’t the goal, Delony said. In fact, he had no social media accounts when he made the switch from higher education to podcasting. Before joining Ramsey’s company in 2020, he was giving a talk to parents of incoming students as Belmont University’s dean of students about what they were about to face emotionally. A Ramsey Solutions executive was in the audience, and she later told Delony that she turned to her husband in the middle of the talk and said, “I’m hiring that guy.” Becoming a public mental health personality wasn’t appealing –– it was scary, actually –– but surrounded by a culture filled with yelling and turmoil, Delony said he felt motivated to take the job for his kids. “This is the scariest thing I can do, but I want to be able to look at my kids and say, ‘I tried to love people well, to give a picture of what loving people well in the public sphere looks like in the world that everyone’s yelling at each other,’” he said. Meeting people where they are and sitting with them when they are hurting is both something fans like about Delony and something he said he prioritizes in his show. Delony works for Ramsey Solutions, hosting his own podcast and cohosting “The Ramsey Show” radio program. Ramsey is a well-known evangelical Christian who has described himself as conservative and spoke in a podcast episode last year about voting for Donald Trump for president. But Delony, who has also talked about his identity as a Christian, has been less direct about where he stands politically. “I guess the best way you could sum me up is the first time I went deer hunting, I had to put a gigantic buck in the back of my Prius,” he said. “I kind of fall all over the place, and I think I’ve been kind of hard to nail down politically.” “I just love everybody, and everybody’s welcome at my house,” Delony added. “It’s always been that way.” Prioritizing empathy for people who are hurting over where you stand on a particular issue is important, he said. It’s easy to demonize people with a political different stance in theory, but it is a lot harder to do that and show up for your friend or loved one when they are impacted by an issue you feel so against, Delony said. And as much as Delony might have intended his show to be a place to nerd out over psychology and data, he said he has found that what most people need is someone to sit with them. No matter what side they stand on or what mess they have gotten into, he wants to be the person others know will sit with them over a tray of nachos and just talk it out, he added. “Even if they don’t like me, they’re like, ‘I know that guy will share a drink with me, and he’ll tell me the truth,’” Delony said. Humans are built to live in a tribe, and when you don’t have strong connections in your community, you can default to finding belonging in a political party, he said. “I work really hard to have other tribes so that I’m not reliant on somebody telling me who to hate, who to not like,” he said. “I’ve got communities that let my heart rest so then I can critically think, and I can examine, and I can sit around and share a table with people who I think have wacky opinions. “But I love them, and they’re hilarious, and they make me laugh, or they frustrate me, but them not being in my tribe isn’t the goal of that communication.” Connecting with people is something that has roots in Delony’s childhood in Texas. His father was a homicide detective in Houston, and someone who people in their church community would often go to for guidance, he said. Delony’s dad would get phone calls at all hours of the night. He would take those calls inside his closet –– which shared a wall with young Delony’s bedroom. Delony said he would fall asleep listening in on stories of people facing mental health issues or jail time, realizing that some of the people he went to church with every week were struggling with things he never would have suspected. “(Mental health has) just kind of been my whole life, from being a little kid all the way till now,” he said. In college, Delony majored in psychology and humanities, got a master’s degree in higher education administration and then earned two doctorates, one in counselor education and supervision and another in higher education administration. Much of his career has been in higher education, where he oversaw student services like residence life and counseling support services. His work in higher education also included crisis response. But his connection with mental health also comes from his experience with his own, he said. In his book, A Not-So-Complicated Approach to Relationships, Mental Health & Wellness,” Delony explains a moment his anxiety reached a boiling point. With a new baby, a country recovering from the 2008 financial crisis and a job helping college students in some of their most difficult moments, Delony writes that he became convinced that the foundation of his new house was crumbling. His wife didn’t see it, nor did his friends –– even the professionals he called to come check it out said he didn’t have a problem. But still, Delony couldn’t let go of the fear that a storm would crack the foundation and destroy his young family’s home, he wrote. So, one night he found himself in the middle of the night crawling through the mud and rain with a flashlight, certain he would find evidence of the structural problem no one but him was worried about. There was nothing. His home was fine, but Delony realized he was not, and he said that was one of the big moments that showed him he needed to address his anxiety. Another story he often shares with listeners is the moment when he and his wife sat across the table from one another after years together, several miscarriages and two children, and they agreed they either needed to start their marriage over or stop being married. They were faced with a choice — end a marriage or learn some new tools for managing their relationship and building their connection, he said. Delony and his wife, Sheila, did learn new relationship skills and are still together after more than 20 years of marriage. That meant him getting into therapy, and both of them learning how to be explicit about what they each needed and expected from one another, he said. But many people find themselves sitting at their own tables across from their partners or looking in the mirror and finding that they aren’t getting enough connection with their friends and family. It makes sense, Delony said. Much of the interaction and community building you would get in the past has now been outsourced: People call a rideshare service instead of asking for a ride home from the airport and you use a delivery app for the cup of sugar you would have otherwise borrowed from a neighbor, he said. The change has been particularly hard on men, who often have been socialized against vulnerability and toward only connecting with others in very specific ways. “I’ll just use the old adage that women build community kneecap to kneecap, and men build it shoulder to shoulder,” he said. For decades, many men in Western cultures have been taught that vulnerability –– saying here is what I need or here is what I am struggling with –– was dangerous; so relationships for many men were built through shared activity, Delony said. Opening up for more connection in a world where many of those activities have been replaced by apps and screens might take intentional effort, he added. Delony had a group of friends that maintained a tradition: Once a month, they chose one friend, gathered at his house and tackled his to-do list together. “In one day, they would clean the carpets, change the front bumper, level the yard, paint the fence, whatever you needed done,” he said. “Everybody ate pizza. … Everybody was working shoulder to shoulder on a project that when you got done, you came out your front yard and everybody high-fived, because this house and this family is different, because we all showed up.” Now, after moving from Texas to Tennessee, he keeps putting himself out there for opportunities to get closer. “I have some rules that when I buy a concert ticket, I have to buy two, or I’ll buy four, and I just invite people,” he said. “I have these little internal rules that I know at the end of a night I’m going to be better, or the night will have been better because I went with a buddy.” And as people seem to get lonelier and more polarized, Delony said he hopes people like him will keep modeling how to be vulnerable, how to build new relationship skills when you have to and how to sit with all kinds of hurting people. .",

    "content": "“Back in my day,” some grandparents say to their adult children, “we didn’t let our kids speak without being spoken to or talk back to without a spanking or question every parental decision without a consequence.” What did happen to time-outs? Or “I’ll give you something to cry about?” There’s a certain segment of parents who reject that form of parenting for something they say may work better, called “gentle parenting.” If you hear the term and roll your eyes, and we know that’s likely — pause for a second. Gentle is often misunderstood and taken to mean coddling, said Dr. Brian Razzino, a licensed clinical psychologist in Falls Church, Virginia. That’s not the case. Gentle parenting –– or what many people mean when they talk about it –– is often about teaching skills for adulthood and enforcing boundaries, and it has a lot to offer families, he said. This strategy is becoming popular as nearly half of parents say they are trying to raise their children differently than how they grew up, according to a 2023 report from the . Those parents said they were looking to give their children more love and affection, having open, honest conversations and yelling less and listening more. The problem is that many people, even those who call themselves gentle parents, differ on the specifics. Here is what you need to know about the latest parenting trend. Psychological researchers have identified : neglectful, authoritarian, permissive and authoritative. Neglectful parenting has neither high levels of warmth toward the child nor rules on a child’s behavior, said Nicole Johnson, a licensed professional counselor in Boise, Idaho. A kid may act out and break a toy and not get much response from their neglectful parent, who might not have attended much to how they were playing anyway. Authoritarian refers to parenting that focuses on obedience and punitive response –– think “because I said so,” Johnson said. The child who broke the toy would likely be yelled at and sent to time-out by the authoritarian parent without much conversation beyond that. Permissive parenting focuses on warmth toward children, but without much structure or boundaries, she added. That parent would acknowledge that the child probably broke the toy out of frustration but wouldn’t follow up on consequences. Authoritative parenting seeks to strike a balance between structure and warmth. “It’s more focused on the idea of improving their ability to understand what’s going on with themselves, their own feelings,” Razzino said. “The parents are really focused on having that empathy for the child and respect when they when they talk with them, and that their feelings are valid.” Still, they are “maintaining some very firm, clear limits.” Gentle parenting is not listed among the main parenting styles. While it is popular on social media, it is a relatively new term that hasn’t been described much in the scientific literature. Researchers Annie Pezalla and Alice Davidson sought to investigate what parenting influencers on social media meant when they talked about gentle parenting in . “Those who identified as gentle really prioritized emotion regulation. These are parents that are wanting to maintain calm at all costs, if at all possible, (including) their energy and emotions,” said Pezalla, visiting assistant professor of psychology at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. “They do look like authoritative parents, for the most part, to us, like they’re trying to hold boundaries and practice consequences with their kids,” she said, “even though they showed the kind of no-holds-barred affection to their kids that typically permissive parents show.” Gentle parenting, like authoritative parenting, emphasizes the importance of boundaries while maintaining warmth and empathy, she said. However, the concept plays out differently in different families. In her research, Pezalla asked parents who identified as gentle parents about their practices. While some resembled authoritative parents, others acted in ways that fell more in line with a permissive style, she said. Ultimately, much of what people refer to as gentle parenting on social media is just another term for authoritative parenting: maintaining connection with the child, teaching them to regulate their emotions and behavior, and enforcing boundaries as a caring authority figure, said Razzino, who is also the author of “ : Keys to Success for Every Teen.” Imagine a child is throwing their food off their plate and onto the floor. A permissive parent might say, “please don’t do that,” and then do nothing else to enforce a boundary. An authoritarian might glare sternly and immediately move to a time-out or spanking or to send their child to bed hungry. An authoritative parent, which is what many people mean when they identify as a gentle parent, might say, “I can see you’re feeling playful, but food stays on the plate. I can give you something else to do with your hands while we have dinner, but if you throw it again, I am going to have to take the plate away,” Razzino said. Some people critique this way of parenting as being too soft on kids, saying that the world is harsh and kids will need to learn to deal with that, Johnson added. But the goal of this parenting style isn’t to shield your child from accountability; rather it is to get to a calmer place for the parent and child, give kids tools for making good choices, and then enforcing a boundary with logical consequences, she said. Logical consequences are ones that relate directly to a behavior: If you smack your friend with a truck, the playdate will be over, Razzino added. For the people who understand gentle parenting as a form of authoritative parenting, there are two parts: validating that you understand the feelings they are experiencing and teaching that not every way of expressing those feelings is acceptable or productive, Johnson said. It is important to neither skip the validation step nor get too bogged down in it, Razzino added. At some point, it is important to move from talking about the feelings to making plans on how to regulate the difficult emotions and what consequences will happen if the unacceptable behavior continues. And this approach has been shown in research to be effective in raising more healthy, resilient, successful adults, Razzino said. One found that children raised with an authoritative parenting style were more likely to achieve academically. Another found that a lack of this parenting style was the most important factor in low life satisfaction. There is a downside to authoritative or gentle parenting. Staying calm, validating your child’s feelings, explaining a boundary and the consequences of breaking it, and then following through with a rational consequence is a lot of work, Pezalla said. It’s even more work if you weren’t parented with a lot of warmth and empathy, Johnson added. With so much pressure to parent perfectly, many parents feel burnt-out trying to adhere too strictly to gentle parenting practices, according to Pezalla’s research. Gentle parents “are working so hard to be emotionally regulated 24/7 that they are burning out,” she said. “That’s what we found in the article that we published … they’re stressed out of their minds.” Some online parenting influencers will say that you can’t use the word no, that you have to say no, that you should pause in a grocery store meltdown to give a hug, or that you need to scoop your child up from the store floor and not allow them to continue the tantrum there, Pezalla said. Instead of worrying too much about following the one right philosophy, Pezalla recommends prioritizing the four things she has found to be what every kid needs growing up. Those include structure, warmth, acknowledgement as an individual who may need something different from their siblings, and an approach that prepares for parenting as a long game, she said. “Everything else is like static noise to me,” Pezalla said. “It’s like the same general authoritative parenting styles, just, we’re calling it something different.” And don’t worry if you mess up, lose your temper or change your mind on your parenting approach, Johnson said. Kids don’t need a model of a perfect human, they need to see an adult who is trying their best to be a positive authority figure, striving for empathy, practicing regulating themselves, and taking accountability when they get it wrong, she added. Hopefully, that model will be a roadmap so they can grow up doing those things, too.",

    "content": ". With the first generation of people exposed widely to technology now , how has its use affected their risk of cognitive decline? That’s a question researchers from two Texas universities sought to answer in a new meta-analysis study, a review of previous studies, published Monday in the journal . The query investigates the “ ,” which argues that lifetime use may increase reliance on technology and weaken cognitive abilities over time. “We say a in youth and midlife is a brain that is more resilient later,” said Dr. Amit Sachdev, medical director of the department of neurology and ophthalmology at Michigan State University, who wasn’t involved in the study. But the authors discovered that the digital dementia hypothesis may not bear out: Their analysis of 57 studies totaling 411,430 older adults found technology use was associated with a 42% lower risk of cognitive impairment, which was defined as a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia, or as subpar performance on cognitive tests. Forms of technology included computers, smartphones, internet, email, social media or “mixed/multiple uses,” according to the new study. “That these effects were found in studies even when factors like education, income, and other lifestyle factors were adjusted was also encouraging: the effect doesn’t seem just due to other brain health factors,” co-lead study author Dr. Jared Benge, associate professor in the department of neurology at the University of Texas at Austin’s Dell Medical School, said via email. The authors searched eight databases for studies published through 2024, and the 57 chosen for their main analysis included 20 studies that followed participants for about six years on average and 37 , which measure health data and outcomes at one point in time. The adults were age 68 on average at the beginning of the studies. While technology use was generally linked with a lower risk of cognitive decline, the findings for were inconsistent, the authors said. None of the 136 studies the authors reviewed overall reported an increased risk of cognitive impairment correlated with technology use — a consistency that is “really quite rare,” said co-lead study author Dr. Michael Scullin, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Baylor University, via email. The research is “a really well-organized and -executed meta-analysis of essentially the entire field over the last 18 years or 20 years,” said Dr. Christopher Anderson, chief of the division of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Anderson wasn’t involved in the study. But if you’re thinking the study’s findings mean you’re free to use technology to your heart’s content since your brain will be fine anyway — not so fast. “Our findings are not a blanket endorsement of mindless scrolling,” Benge, who is also a clinical neuropsychologist at UT Health Austin’s Comprehensive Memory Center, said. “They are instead a hint that the generation that gave us the internet has found ways to get some net positive benefits from these tools to the brain.” And despite the study’s significance, there are still many uncertainties about the relationships between various aspects of technology use and brain health. One of the study’s limitations is that it doesn’t have details on how people were using technological devices, experts said. As a result, it’s unclear whether participants were using computers or phones in ways that meaningfully exercised their brains, or what specific way may be most associated with cognitive protection. Lacking information on the amount of time technology was used means it’s also unknown whether there is harmful threshold or if only a little time is needed for cognitive benefits, Anderson said. These questions are difficult “to try to answer, because the sheer volume of technology exposures that we have to navigate is so high,” Sachdev said. “To isolate one technology exposure and its effect is difficult, and to measure just a whole ecosystem of technology exposures and … their aggregate effect is also a challenge.” Additionally, “the amount that we can extrapolate from this study towards future generations is very unclear, given the ubiquity of technology today that people are exposed to and have been exposed to from their birth,” Anderson said. “When you think about the kind of technology that this cohort would’ve been interacting with earlier in their lives, it’s a time when you had to really work to use technology,” Anderson added. Their brains were also already well formed, Benge said. The study may support the alternative to the digital dementia hypothesis, which is the cognitive reserve theory. The theory “contends that exposure to complex mental activities leads to better cognitive well-being in older age,” even in the face of age-related brain changes, according to the study. That technology may reduce risk of cognitive decline by helping us be more neurologically active is possible, Sachdev said. Technology use can also foster social connection in some instances, and social isolation has been linked of developing dementia. It’s also possible that older adults who are using technology may already have more active and resilient brains, explaining their engagement with technology. Inferences on best practices for technology use in consideration of cognitive health can’t be drawn from the study since it didn’t have specifics on participants’ use habits, experts said. But “it does support that a healthy mix of activities is likely to be the most beneficial, and that fits with other literature on the topic as well,” Anderson said. “What this probably does more than anything else is provide some reassurance that there’s no association between at least moderate use of technology and cognitive decline.” Engaging in moderation is best, Sachdev said. And that should largely bring joy, genuine connection, creativity and intellectual stimulation to your life, experts said. “It should be productive in some way,” he added, and entertaining yourself can sometimes meet that requirement. But if you’re experiencing eye or neck strain from sitting in front of a screen, that’s a sign you’re using technology too much. “Too much of anything can be a bad thing,” Sachdev said. “Identifying the purpose and the duration and then executing along those lines is how we would advise for most topics.” Some older adults have avoided technology use, thinking it’s too difficult to learn. But Scullin and others have found even people with mild dementia can be trained to use such devices, he said. Though sometimes frustrating, the difficulty “is a reflection of the mental stimulation afforded through learning the device,” Scullin added.",

    "content": "Lately I find myself feeling stuck in a chronic state of stress, constantly worrying about my work, my kids’ futures and yes, the health of my retirement portfolio. Sound familiar? I didn’t always worry so much, but life has a funny way of piling on the pressures as we get older and take on more responsibilities. While my family is not in crisis now, it has gotten harder to manage this stress. Because my specialty is urology, I also care about what acute and chronic stress are doing to your bladder and hormones as well as your overall health. It helps to distinguish between two types of stress: acute and chronic. Acute stress is your body’s immediate reaction to a perceived threat. Think about how your heart pounds before a big presentation or how you jump when you hear a loud noise. It’s intense but usually short-lived. Our bodies are built to handle acute stress and typically return to normal afterward. Chronic stress, however, is persistent. It’s the daily weight of ongoing issues, such as financial woes, relationship issues, work pressures or health concerns. Unlike acute stress, chronic stress keeps you in a constant state of high alert — chipping away at your health, often without you noticing. When you are stressed, your body launches a carefully coordinated response known as the fight-or-flight reaction. It all begins in the hypothalamus, the brain’s command center, which activates two parallel systems in your adrenal glands: the and the . The sympathetic nervous   system triggers the release of adrenaline, which primes your body to act quickly. This fast-acting hormone increases your heart rate and blood pressure, opens up your airways, heightens your senses and sends more blood to your muscles. Cortisol is released a little later through the HPA axis. Unlike adrenaline’s quick action, cortisol plays a longer-term role in helping the body cope with sustained stress. Cortisol increases blood sugar, enhances the brain’s focus and memory, and puts things such as digestion, fertility and immunity on the back burner — because in a crisis, your body is focused on survival. Working together, adrenaline and cortisol   seamlessly help the body cope with short-term threats. However, if stress becomes chronic, elevated cortisol levels can lead to fatigue, sleep problems, weight gain and other health issues. For me, this response kicks in during intense moments in surgery — such as seeing an unexpected gush of bleeding. Instead of fleeing (which would be frowned upon in the operating room), my body shifts into fight mode: I zero in on the bleeding vessel, focus sharply and act swiftly to get things under control. In such high-stakes moments, the stress response is not just helpful but essential.  But when the triggers are constant — unpaid bills or work deadlines — your body can get stuck in that heightened state. Over time, consistently high cortisol levels disrupt your immune system, impair metabolism, affect mood regulation and even contribute to chronic inflammation — all of which can increase the risk of long-term health issues. Have you ever noticed how anxiety makes you suddenly need the bathroom — especially right before a big speech or meeting? I experience this firsthand before every speech or live TV appearance: Without fail, my bladder goes into overdrive, and I find myself desperately looking for the nearest restroom. Stress directly affects bladder control by overstimulating the nerves responsible for regulating bladder function, leading to increased urgency, more frequent trips to the bathroom and even occasional leaking. My most memorable (and embarrassing) bladder moment was just before delivering a TEDx talk. There I was, backstage with two microphones strapped on, hair and makeup flawless, counting down the final two minutes before going live. Then suddenly — my bladder called. With no time to spare, I sprinted to the bathroom. I was still there when they announced my name. I bolted back out, breathless, laughing awkwardly as I stepped onto the stage. I played it off as a joke then, but deep down I knew my bladder was reacting to stress. has consistently linked higher stress and anxiety levels with overactive bladder symptoms. Your bladder doesn’t just respond to how much fluid you’ve had to drink; it also reacts dramatically to your mental state. Chronic stress is no friend to your sex life. When your body is constantly flooded with stress hormones such as cortisol, it throws your natural hormonal balance out of sync — significantly and . As stress hormones rise, sex hormones fall. The result? Lower libido, erectile dysfunction in men, difficulties with arousal in women, and trouble reaching orgasm for everyone. have highlighted psychological stress as one of the leading causes of sexual dysfunction among otherwise healthy adults, emphasizing just how deep the mind and body are connected when it comes to sexual health. But hormones aren’t the only factor. Chronic stress can also affect blood flow, which is vital for sexual response. And when stress disrupts your sleep, it further compounds the problem since sleep is essential for healthy hormone production and sexual functioning. The emotional toll is equally significant. When you’re stressed, intimacy and connection often take a back seat as your mind becomes occupied with worries. Over time, this pattern can strain relationships, further dampening sexual desire. If you’ve noticed stress affecting intimacy, remember it’s not “all in your head.” It’s a super complex hormonal, physical and emotional response — one you can address by taking steps to reduce stress and prioritize relaxation, intimacy and self-care. Chronic stress can also hijack your sleep. High cortisol levels and persistent anxiety prevent deep, restorative sleep, leaving you feeling exhausted even after a full night in bed. Poor sleep then elevates stress levels further, creating a frustrating, self-perpetuating cycle that can profoundly affect your health. I experienced this firsthand last year. I went through a period of terrible sleep — tossing, turning, waking frequently and never feeling truly rested. I started gaining weight rapidly, and despite dedicated workouts, I didn’t see progress in the gym. I felt sluggish, drained and defeated. Eventually, I had to acknowledge that my poor sleep, driven by chronic stress, was the real culprit. Beyond affecting sleep, chronic stress is a powerful trigger for numerous serious health conditions. Sustained exposure to cortisol and other stress hormones promotes inflammation, suppresses immune function and creates conditions in the body that set the stage for disease. Chronic stress has been directly linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes. The emphasizes that stress not only directly raises blood pressure but also indirectly contributes to unhealthy habits, including smoking, poor diet and sedentary lifestyles. At one point, chronic stress started causing me frequent heart palpitations. Initially, I blamed caffeine, lack of sleep due to being on call and general fatigue. When I finally saw a cardiologist and underwent extensive testing, my diagnosis was stress. I was stunned. I am a physician accustomed to diagnosing others, yet chronic stress had quietly compromised my own heart health. The risks associated with stress don’t end at your heart. suggests chronic stress might even accelerate cancer progression by impairing your body’s immune defenses and creating conditions that encourage cancer cell growth. Chronic stress also increases the risk for metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes as well as mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression. My own experiences served as a powerful wake-up call: Stress was not a minor inconvenience — it was a genuine threat to my overall health. Recognizing and addressing it through targeted stress-management strategies isn’t just good advice — it could literally save your life. While stress is unavoidable, understanding how it affects your bladder, sexual health, hormones, sleep and overall well-being gives you the power to recognize and manage it before it takes control. To be clear, not all stress is harmful. Acute stress can even motivate you, helping you tackle challenges head-on. But chronic stress — the kind that builds quietly from daily pressures such as financial worries or family concerns — is what slowly chips away at your health, often going unnoticed until symptoms become impossible to ignore. So, the next time you catch yourself anxiously refreshing your retirement portfolio or losing sleep over your kids’ futures, take a moment. Step away. Stretch. Take a short walk. Or just breathe. These small acts can lower stress levels, reset your nervous system and protect your long-term health. And yes, I’ll be prescribing the same medicine to myself.",

    "content": "In one 48-hour period this winter the garbage disposal went out, the dishwasher stopped working, one of my kids left the garage door open overnight, and two pipes burst. Sometimes these singular problems multiply like rabbits, and I lay awake at night going over budgets and worrying about finances. Or I focus on the past and wonder what I could have done to prevent all of this. My thoughts get loud and crowded, screaming matches occur in my mind, and I start to feel tingling in my forearms. By morning, my patience is gone, my stress and anxiety are up, and my family can pay the price. During this latest pileup, I ran around trying to get a handle on everything, needing help but feeling overloaded so I didn’t ask for it. My youngest son spotted trouble and warned his siblings: “Dad is doing that fast walk thing — watch out.” I’m usually patient with my three children, but when I’m overloaded, I become a tyrant with a short temper who barks orders. In these moments, my wife pulls me away just so I can breathe. “There are battles going on inside the minds of men,” said Dr. Jett Stone, a clinical psychologist based in Greenwich, Connecticut, and author of “ .” “Men tend to externalize, which means that the inner stuff gets put out into the world, whether it’s reckless driving, drinking or hyperactivity,” said Stone, who specializes in men’s mental health. “Men are socialized into holding back their interior life.” Stone gave me hope that it doesn’t have to be that way, sharing his guidance for how men can learn to calm our thoughts and take control of our actions. It can cause stress, and then your heart beats faster, your hands get clammy, and you might get a headache. Or maybe you feel something else. Everyone has different physical symptoms. One of the best places to catch overthinking is by noticing how your body feels. Sometimes it’s simpler for men to access their bodies than it is to access what’s going on in their minds. Men are being asked to take on more of the mental load, which includes emotional labor — which is the time spent helping to address, manage and regulate the emotions of your kids and yourself around parenting. They are also asked to take on more of the cognitive load, which is what you need to do as a parent. One example: I need to pick up the kids from a sports practice, which means I need to plan it and then execute it. It’s the executive function of being a modern parent. It’s laborious and invisible. We are naturally going to feel more cluttered in our minds. It is a function of modern society demanding more of fathers and rightfully so. The first step is recognizing and naming the overthinking. Even just calling that out to yourself is incredibly powerful. The next step would be to get in touch with the triggers of it. What are your particular triggers for overthinking when it comes to fatherhood? For some dads, it comes with, “Am I spending enough quality time with my kids with the demands of work?” “Did I react too harshly?” “Can I provide enough for my family?” These are all questions that can set men off on mental loops. The next step is to do a quick breathing routine like a cyclic sigh, which has really strong health benefits and really produces calm. Basically, it is two inhalations, followed by a really slow out-breath. You can combine this with a mindfulness technique called a body scan. Go from the top of your body to the bottom or vice versa and notice your body markers of your stress. Notice that tension in your shoulders, arms or wherever. Breathe into it, tense it up and relax it. Mapping is recognizing what triggers your overthinking and then asking where does this go. It’s pinpointing those moments. For example, let’s say your boss gives you feedback about your underperformance in a meeting, and afterward, you find yourself stuck in a mental loop. Your mind might go from “I sounded so stupid in front of him” to “I’ll never be able to buy a home if I don’t make more money.” Using mapping, you would slow down, shift your focus and begin to notice and categorize the path your mind takes. Instead of fueling the overthinking, you zoom out and map through writing or observing how your thoughts veered across themes: from self-image to financial security, all in one loop. These are some of the categories I include in the book. In this example, one small interaction triggered a familiar mental route. “Mapping” this route using common categories helps you recognize where your mind tends to go when left to its own devices. Our deeper drives, are things like belonging, wanting to connect and be accepted by others, competence, to feel like you’re capable and effective. They are human needs. This may require some solo contemplation, dialogue with friends, therapy or journaling. Ask yourself: “What am I seeking? Am I seeking something like belonging? Am I missing a sense of orientation in the world, meaning, fulfillment or direction?” It’s never usually one thing. It can be incredibly liberating when you can pinpoint an unmet drive. It’s no longer about saying this is not just some silly insecurity that I have. It’s something all humans need. Juxtapose gratitude with overthinking. Overthinking is narrowly focused, while gratitude increases your field of vision. Helping others expands that visual field. It helps you gain perspective and move beyond the self-referential type of thinking into the outer world and where you need it, where you can lend a hand. Showing gratitude can be done in a text to friend, a phone call to your parent or verbally saying  (something) to a spouse or partner. It can be as simple as saying thank you for cleaning the kitchen. A gratitude journal is a way to making yourself aware of what to be grateful for in your life. You can simply write down a couple of things or people you are grateful for each morning. There’s usually stuff that lives beneath the anger. Sometimes anger is righteous, justified and productive. Sometimes, it is unproductive anger, which is not effective. If you notice you are angry, a stop sign needs to come up in your mind at that moment. Pause and just breathe. A lot of times we are not breathing in those moments. Taking the time to do that can take anger from a 10 to a 9. Observe it for a second and even just ask yourself one question. What do I want from this? What are my goals? It then can take that anger from an 8 to a 7. Anger can be really scary for family members, especially coming from a dad, because it’s a big, intimidating emotion. Channel that instinct and do a little bit of self-interrogation. The second question you can ask is what is living beneath? What emotions are living beneath this anger? Am I fearful of not being able to provide for my family? Am I feeling ashamed that I’m not holding my weight? I would say that those aren’t two different parts of yourself. You are many selves, and both of those are part of who you are, but accepting that can be very hard. It’s a part of you, and you need to be aware of it. It’s getting those perspectives out of opposition and becoming more at peace that we are many things.",

    "content": "“Everybody’s ,” according to Canadian rock band Loverboy. If you work a traditional five-day workweek, you might relate to that feeling. But if someone is in a constant loop of dreading Monday through Friday and only looking forward to days off, it might not be the most fulfilling way to live, psychology experts say. “It’s totally understandable, and a lot of people are living their lives in that way, but I don’t think it’s the most satisfying way,” said Dr. James Pawelski, professor of practice and director of education in the Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania. “There are five weekdays and only two weekend days. So, if most of (the time) you’re looking back or you’re looking forward, you’re missing out on your life,” Pawelski said. Whether or not you have your dream job, there are ways to incorporate more activities you enjoy throughout the week to make the workdays more exciting. Here’s what Pawelski and other experts want you to know about finding that work-life balance rather than waiting for the weekend. After a busy workday, it’s tempting to want to go home and plop down on the couch for the rest of the evening — even Pawelski agrees. But sometimes an extra push to do a different activity after work can be more energizing and satisfying. “It’s a paradox — we think it’s taking a break that energizes, right? If you’re on empty, you just got to take a break until you feel more energy,” he said. “But it turns out that effort energizes.” Instead of scheduling every activity on the weekend, Pawelski recommends planning a fun or goal-focused activity during the week to keep momentum going after work. Pawelski has started Thursday night improv classes with his wife, Suzann Pileggi Pawelski. And they both go, even when they’re tired. “When it comes around to Thursday night, and it’s been a crazy busy week. And if you said to me, ‘Would you like to go to improv right now? … or would you rather just kind of sit down and relax?’ I’d probably say, ‘You know what, I’m exhausted. I just want to sit down and relax,” Pawelski said. “But the thing is, it’s already scheduled. It’s paid for. We now have really good friends there. … And so, you know, you get to improv, and before long, it’s like, ‘Oh my goodness. This is so energizing.’” When the next day rolls around, it feels more satisfying to have followed through with your promises, even if it was hard in the moment, said Pileggi Pawelski, a well-being writer and positive psychology expert. The couple coauthored the book “ : Using the Science of Positive Psychology to Build Love That Lasts.” Shared activities can also help build relationships and foster those moments to connect with people throughout the week, she added. “We live our lives in the moment, and unfortunately, a lot of people miss the opportunity to connect if you’re just waiting for the weekend, whether it’s with your romantic partner, your friends (or) colleagues at work.” To make more meaningful interactions that feel less transactional than the usual small talk during the week, Pileggi Pawelski recommends setting a goal to learn something new about a person every day, asking them questions that relate to them and their individuality. Planned activities that both people find exciting, such as the improv classes, a team sport or a meetup for coffee and a puzzle, are also helpful to making these connections. “Our relationships and our social connections are the most important thing to well-being, and I think a lot of us lose ourselves in work,” she said. “Just think of something that brings you joy. There’s no right or wrong. … Plan that activity — ideally, you know, doing something with other people — and put it in your calendar to do it regularly.” By adding in other activities outside work, people also tend to diversify their identities, which helps during the inevitable setbacks and failures throughout a career, said Dr. Emiliana Simon-Thomas, science director of the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley. The center is a research institute that studies the psychology, sociology and . For example, someone might think, “I might have missed that due date or lost that opportunity to do a project, because now we don’t have the funding for it,” Simon-Thomas added. “But my friends and neighbors are all so excited to talk with me about the book that we all read … or I have to show up and play second base (in baseball) on Tuesday, and I’m important, and I matter in those other contexts.” The average person will spend an estimated one-third of their life at work — about . If someone does not enjoy what they do during this large chunk of time, it can be “a huge problem,” said Dr. Sonja Lyubomirsky, a researcher on happiness and a distinguished professor of psychology at the University of California, Riverside. But if someone is not able to switch jobs to something more in tune with their interests, there are other ways to spin a more positive outlook on work, said Lyubomirsky, who is also the author of the book “ : A Scientific Approach to Getting the Life You Want.” When thinking about your daily activities, ask yourself if “there is something you can find that you feel like, ‘maybe this is making the life of one person easier or better,’” Lyubomirsky said. Even by completing small tasks such as sending out an email at work, a person can relate this effort back to core values and goals, Simon-Thomas said. Whether someone is interested in a career path in science and studying longevity, or invested in the arts and hope to inspire future generations, these small tasks can point to larger goals, she said. Tell yourself something like, “I’m answering those emails so that I can accomplish this particular task, which will enable us to commence this project. And this project is in the service of this bigger aim or vision or goal that’s so valuable to me,” she added. It is also important to foster relationships in the workplace, Lyubomirsky said, and that having conversations with people throughout the day can cause small bursts of positive emotions. Those bursts can also come from treating oneself to things such as a sweet treat or a walk in the park during a work break, she said. “The hallmark of happiness is the experience of frequent positive emotions. Positive emotions could be joy, but it could also be curiosity. It could be calm, pride, affection — it could be lots of things depending on the person,” Lyubomirsky said. “So (think to yourself), what are ways that you could create those little bursts of positive emotion?”",

    "content": "Imagine your dad was a bully. If so, when you were a child, he might have withheld affection and warmth and been quick to be critical if things didn’t go his way. As an adult, you would find yourself being a people pleaser with the men in your life –– afraid to be rejected and emotionally abandoned. The hurt as a child and the impacts carried into adulthood are a good example of when it might be time for some , said Nicole Johnson, a licensed professional counselor in Boise, Idaho. “So many of us are walking around with childhood wounds that are influencing our relationships, our choices and how we cope and deal with life, and we just haven’t made that connection yet,” she added. That’s where reparenting comes in. You might think it sounds like self-indulgence or an excuse to buy the doll you wanted when you were younger, but reparenting is a that might help you save yourself and future generations from a lot of pain. People tend to treat themselves and their emotions the way they were treated by their parents, Johnson said. Reparenting is relearning how to respond to yourself better. “Reparenting is a process where you learn how to identify where you need to be raised, where you need to grow yourself up,” she added. “This is cultivating and implementing tools and new beliefs and perspectives for how you’re treating yourself now.” The tools and beliefs are worth the work, said Johnson, author of “ Healing Unresolved Childhood Trauma and Reclaiming Wholeness through Self-Compassion,” which will be released in July. “A lot of us are trying to wade through how to handle older generations that … have hurt us, and then trying to raise new generations to not know that pain,” Johnson said. “A lot of us are trying to figure out how to do that, and reparenting answers all of those questions.” Reparenting is not about giving into your every whim. And although it doesn’t mean acting like an infant again, it does require recognizing that many of the thoughts and behaviors you’d like to change come from lingering feelings of childhood traumas or your inner child, said Dr. Avigail Lev, a licensed clinical psychologist at the Bay Area CBT Center in San Francisco. Healing those traumas often means responding to your inner child like a loving, healthy parent, Johnson said. The parents most of us needed in traumatic times were loving and warm with firm boundaries, she said, and that’s who you need for reparenting in adulthood. “So many of us are shaming ourselves or hating on ourselves, and then that shame and hate makes us want to numb out, and then we go self-sabotage and engage in something that is maybe indulging in some way,” Johnson said. “A good, grounded, educated, healthy parent is not going to scream and yell at you for that (but) they’re also not going to allow it.” You wouldn’t scold a child in the bullying dad example for being afraid of upsetting him, but you would guide them to stand up for themselves when they can and learn ways to cope other than just people pleasing. The compassion to yourself comes in validating the feelings your inner child is having –– the stress, fear, anger or sadness — and make adult decisions about the best way to move forward, Lev said. “We’re validating internal experiences,” she added. “It’s not permission to do bad behaviors.” If attending to your childhood wounds and responding with kindness feels selfish, it is important to remember that compassion for oneself often makes people more compassionate to others, Lev said. Trauma and abuse are much broader than only physical violence or neglect, and part of your healing may be realizing that your experiences deserve to be reparented, Johnson said. A parent not being emotionally available might leave a wound on your inner child, said Dr. Brian Razzino, a licensed clinical psychologist in Falls Church, Virginia. Chaos or disorganization at home might do it, too. The way you talk to yourself is a good way to discern if reparenting might be useful to you, he said. Do you feel guilty when you stand up for yourself or say no when you need to? Do you struggle to feel like you are or have done enough? Do you tend to feel very stressed around authority figures? Do you struggle opening up or feeling like you will be abandoned in relationships? Those might be signs you weren’t taught how to handle those situations as a child, and you need to teach yourself now, Razzino said. Reparenting yourself can start simple. It has two important components— learning how your traumas show up in your life and making changes to heal them, Johnson said. “If you were a little bit kinder to yourself today, or if you gained insight, if you had an ‘Aha’ like, ‘Oh, man, I really do talk to myself the way my mom talked to me,’ or you identify a childhood wound … all of that is a form of reparenting,” she said. If you were the person with the bullying dad, Johnson would recommend identifying what you are feeling now, such as “I’m scared of being rejected or criticized,” and then kindly reassuring yourself. Maybe you practice saying, “I am worthy of love apart from how well I perform. I accept and approve of myself,” Johnson recommends. To go a step further and address your inner child, Johnson advises forming a relationship with your inner child. If you saw a scared or sad child, you wouldn’t just start barking orders at them, right? Sometimes forming a relationship means indulging in the things a younger you would have loved, like running in the rain, watching a movie or making a dish you loved, she added. For some people, it helps to identify the wounded inner child, Johnson said. Some of her clients like to find a picture of themselves from an age when they experienced trauma. Others like to paint an image or assign a song for the child, she said. Then, give that child what they needed when they were hurt. In the example with the bullying dad, you could give your inner child the love and warmth they wanted and didn’t get with your father, Johnson said. In a case like this, Johnson might ask you to imagine sitting with your 9-year-old self on your childhood bed when younger you is crying because your dad yelled at you for missing a soccer goal and then sent you to your room when he saw your tears, she said. She would then ask you to imagine scooping the little you up, holding them and saying something like, “I know it’s confusing and hurtful when dad acts like that … I love you just as you are and am cheering you on all the way.” “This work is deeply emotional and can be really overwhelming,” she said. But if you do the work, it can lead to healing of the trauma as well as more confidence, security and better relationships moving forward, Johnson said. While you can start now, working through reparenting with a therapist can help give you perspective on what traumas you need to work through, tools to help you maintain self-compassion in difficult circumstances and experiences to counteract wounds that your inner child experienced, Lev added.",

    "content": "When Dr. Luc Beaudoin was an undergraduate student nearly 40 years ago, he often had on Sunday nights and was eager to find a solution. He found inspiration in class he was taking and regarding visual motion detection, Beaudoin, now a cognitive scientist, said. Visual motion detection refers to the visual system’s ability to perceive and process motion based on changing patterns of light on the retina. “I thought to myself: If I can understand the human brain’s ‘sleep onset control system,’ I could perhaps devise a technique to trick the brain into falling asleep,” Beaudoin, who is also an adjunct professor of education at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, said via email. That technique was cemented as “cognitive shuffling” by 2009, when he was 41 and experiencing another bout of difficulty initially falling asleep or falling back asleep after waking up in the middle of the night. “My insomnia went away,” Beaudoin said. “My girlfriend (now my wife) was amazed that I would fall asleep so quickly. I felt I was onto something important. So, I read more extensively and thought deeply about the sleep onset control system.” Cognitive shuffling typically involves mentally conjuring up random, impersonal and non-emotionally charged words. For each letter of a word you pick at random, you think of as many corresponding words as you can for five to eight seconds each before moving to the next letter, Beaudoin said. For the word “piano,” for example, you might think “Pear, parachute, Paul, pirouette … Item, intention, immature, igloo …” and so on. (Beaudoin is also an owner of CogZest and a cofounder of CogSci Apps Corp. and Somnolence+ Inc., all of which develop products based on his research.) While the technique may not sound calming, it “takes your mind off of your problems and your issues, and helps you get into a more relaxed state of mind,” said Dr. Fariha Abbasi-Feinberg, a sleep medicine physician and neurologist at the Millennium Physician Group in Fort Myers, Florida. “I always tell patients, ‘You cannot force yourself to sleep. You have to allow yourself to sleep.’ And this is just one of the methods that we use to help with that,” added Abbasi-Feinberg, who often suggests the technique for her patients having sleep issues. Sometimes you can even visualize corresponding scenarios or movements, such as yourself playing the piano or someone falling with a parachute, Beaudoin said. Here’s the science behind cognitive shuffling, and what to know about practicing it. At this point, there’s little research on cognitive shuffling. So what makes some doctors back a do-it-yourself sleep hack without substantial evidence? It turns out that the fundamental theory behind cognitive shuffling, though conjectural, “aligns with established principles in cognitive neuroscience and sleep psychology,” Dr. Leah Kaylor, a clinical psychologist and author based in Louisiana, said via email. It’s based on a large number of studies Beaudoin and other researchers reviewed in a paper published April 2020 in the journal . In addition to taking the mind off one’s worries, cognitive shuffling “resembles in critical respects natural sleep onset,” Beaudoin said. In the natural transition into sleep, people tend to have “microdreams” and fragmented, nonlinear thought patterns, Beaudoin and Kaylor said. Intentionally engaging in random, disconnected thinking may replicate this cognitive presleep state, . “We think there’s a positive feedback loop in the brain: Microdreams are not just a product of falling asleep; they cue the brain that it is safe and appropriate to fall asleep,” Beaudoin said. Since our brains tend to “shuffle” between random thoughts during quieter periods, giving our brains a calming or neutral distraction can be more helpful than allowing them to find something on their own, Dr. Kami McManus, a sleep psychologist in the department of sleep medicine at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia, said via email. Beaudoin published on cognitive shuffling in 2016. The study’s sample size was small, but its findings were encouraging: 154 college students, most of them female, were randomly assigned to a standard treatment done before bedtime, to practicing a cognitive shuffling exercise more formally known as a serial diverse imagining task (SDIT), or to both. In the SDIT group, an app randomly presented recordings of words one at a time with eight-second intervals in between, during which participants created and maintained an image of the word until the next recording prompted the next image and so on. The SDIT group were more likely to experience improvements in sleep quality, difficulty falling asleep and — heightened physical or mental activity while trying to fall asleep. These benefits lasted throughout the semester. Beaudoin and his team are planning additional research, this time comparing cognitive shuffling to other mental visualization and cognitive techniques. To practice cognitive shuffling, there isn’t a set number of words or amount of time required. The words you choose for each letter also don’t have to be logically related, Kaylor said — trying to control the randomness will reduce the technique’s effectiveness. People typically report falling asleep within around five to 15 minutes, while others may take longer, especially if they’re highly stressed or prone to overthinking, Kaylor said. If you find yourself engaged in the technique for more than 20 minutes or starting to feel frustrated, it’s best to give up and get out of bed, McManus said. Your body may not be ready, so doing a calming activity elsewhere for 20 to 30 minutes before going back to bed and trying again is better than trying too hard and activating negative emotions, making sleep more difficult. Try this technique several nights in a row before you decide whether cognitive shuffling works for you, these experts recommended. However, remember that it’s not a replacement for proper sleep hygiene or a cure for a sleep condition. “If someone drinks a lot of coffee before bed, they shouldn’t expect cognitive techniques to help them fall asleep,” Beaudoin said. Additionally, you should still ensure you have regular sleep and wake times; a bedtime routine involving other such as journaling or taking a warm shower; a quiet, dark and cool room; limited screen time before bed; and no alcohol in the few hours before sleep. If you regularly have problems sleeping, Beaudoin emphasized that cognitive techniques in general aren’t replacements for medical advice. They’re also not substitutes for cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, , as many cases of insomnia have more than one element in need of treatment.",

Whether this trend results from an , which leaves people wanting for company, or a , in which individuals prioritize solo time, the fact remains that more of us are on our own more often. But humans are social creatures whose well-being on belonging, and too much solitude comes with significant health — for individuals and society. At the same time, the US health care system is “expensive, complicated, dysfunctional” and possibly “broken,” . Higher costs do not translate to , and uneven access leads to for people of color and other marginalized groups. “Social prescribing,” which entails offering health care referrals for community activities, not just medications, can help on all fronts, argues solutions-focused journalist . In her book, “ The Prescriptive Power of Movement, Nature, Art, Service, and Belonging,” Hotz shares how nurturing interpersonal connections and encouraging community involvement can improve individuals’ physical and mental health, while also strengthening communities. , and already popular in the UK, the social prescribing movement is gaining traction in the US. As evidence mounts that meaningful relationships are as crucial to our well-being as diet and exercise, Hotz explains the science of connection and gives practical suggestions to help combat our growing isolation. Social prescriptions are health care referrals for activities and resources in your community. Recognizing the significant role that our environment, relationships and community play in our health outcomes, these prescriptions typically involve movement, art, nature, service and some element of belonging. When people are struggling with issues like anxiety, depression or even chronic pain, sometimes the most effective intervention isn’t a just a pill but also reconnecting with community. Because social determinants account for , incorporating them as a healing modality just makes sense. Not at all. This is about complementing traditional medications, therapies and other treatments with evidence-based social interventions. While I am concerned about overprescribing, I also have a lot of empathy for doctors who feel that medications, surgeries and other conventional treatments are their only options. Rather than replacing or taking away standard treatments, the goal of social prescribing is to invest in alternatives so we’re putting more, not fewer, options on the table. You can take your prescription antidepressant and take a walk with friends, and both can help with your . The science supports the of prescriptions for movement, nature, art, service and belonging to ease symptoms of , including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), chronic pain, dementia and loneliness. Exercise, for example, helps treat disorders, , and . Treating symptoms only through conventional therapies and medication misses the powerful impact that interacting meaningfully with other people in our communities has on our health. Here’s an example from someone I interviewed: When Akeela’s back injury developed into chronic pain she had to leave her job. Without her work as a caretaker, she lost her sense of purpose and became very depressed. She tried every therapy, pill and surgery that doctors prescribed for her pain. Some of it helped. But what really made her feel better was an unconventional prescription: volunteering for a children’s health care charity. By turning the focus away from herself and her pain and toward care for others, the severity of her back pain lessened. In an era when so many people are , it’s critical that we take advantage of all available remedies — even unexpected ones like volunteering in your community. Social prescribing works because it’s personalized. It’s not about pushing everyone into the same activities but connecting individuals with activities that resonate with their particular values and interests. When her patients are struggling, pain psychologist Dr. Rachel Zoffness suggests that they visualize pain as a dial. Just as experiencing negative emotions, like sadness and anger, can turn the pain dial up, other things can turn it down, including distraction. She asks her patients to think of an occasion when they got so caught up in what they were doing that they forgot about their pain. When health care providers ask these kinds of questions, they’re helping patients figure out the social prescriptions that might work best for them. Although social prescribing is more mainstream in countries with nationalized health care systems, such as the UK, the movement is growing. An increasing number of providers are issuing social prescriptions around the 50 states. , a nonprofit, tracks initiatives, pilots and research projects across the country in an . Meanwhile, I recommend people begin by prescribing themselves spots in in their local communities. To , people can ask questions like: What did I love doing as a child? If I had two extra hours in my day, what would I spend them on? What makes me lose track of time? Loneliness has a on physical as well as mental health. If you’re lonely, you’re more likely to die prematurely; you’re more likely to be anxious or depressed or get dementia; you’re more likely to end up in the emergency room. The consequences of all that are equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Because they align with a patient’s interests and values, social prescriptions create meaningful connection — the kind of connection that seems more compelling than staying at home. This has tremendous health benefits. The goal is not “let’s all get in a kumbaya circle and hold hands and be best friends and hug a stranger.” Instead, social prescriptions reconnect you with what matters Humans have evolved so that social connections are a need just as vital as food and water. Yet, record numbers of us are choosing to . Life is exhausting. We work hard. We’re burnt-out. Digital media might make us we feel like we’re constantly connected, but it leaves us so drained that we just want to retreat into our homes and not see anyone. We were not wired to live in the conditions that modern life demands. For some people — such as those with limited mobility or individuals who feel isolated because of differences between them and their local community — online connection can be a lifesaver. But most online interaction, particularly on social media, doesn’t provide the elements of connection that are truly restorative. Quality connection provides feelings of inclusion, being seen and affirmed for who you are and a true sense of belonging. Forging a real connection leaves you feeling like you know yourself better after spending time with that person. And that may be more beneficial for your health than spending time with 10 people who you don’t know well. Solitude is important for some of us, some of the time. But when being alone becomes the norm, we can start to experience the health consequences of loneliness without even realizing it. Science tells us that belonging is healing. , which followed people for more than eight decades, names the strength of relationships as the No. 1 one predictor of health and longevity. This has enormous consequences. People who lack a sense of belonging elsewhere can wind up becoming involved in sometimes very harmful and extreme political causes. from , for example, often include discussion of depression, social isolation, loneliness and lack of belonging leading up to their getting sucked in. People , research shows. Even just can activate our brain circuits. That can translate into a desperation that leads people to find belonging in places that do a lot of damage. Groups mobilizing to cause harm to people are growing in popularity because society is not provided something it once did. We can counter this trend by investing in other spaces for connection — local opportunities for engaging in movement, nature, art, service and belonging — things that just happen to be really healthy for us, too. — These five pillars are not just nice add-ons; these are requirements for our life. We know this is true because of how our health improves when we engage in these activities. Moving our bodies releases serotonin and endorphins and improves our hippocampus function. Spending time in nature restores our attention and focus. Some studies have shown taking Ritalin. Engaging in art anxiety and trauma symptoms, which makes sense given how humans have used storytelling and art to cope with tough emotions since the beginning of time. Service and belonging are the biggest because we didn’t survive in the big, bad wild all on our own; we survived in a group. Just think about how, for generations, last names reflected our function within the community. Now, many of us are not engaging in communities but choosing artificial and often electronic sources of connection. That’s when our health begins to suffer. Investing in social prescribing bridges divides, offering a bipartisan solution to address issues important to people across the political spectrum. Folks on the left are concerned about health care access and affordability. On the right, the is concerned about pharmaceutical safety and reducing chemicals in our food and medicines while fiscal conservatives are focused on cost-cutting. Not only does social prescribing provide significant health benefits, but it also actually over time while reducing pressure on an overburdened system. Think of the 92-year-old who goes to the hospital just because she doesn’t have anywhere else to go. Instead, prescribing her a weekly phone call with someone or a spot in a knitting group is going to save health care resources and ultimately . If we want to invest in an approach that improves health outcomes, reduces health care costs and can appeal to people of all political persuasions, let’s recognize the way our environments affect our health and prioritize social prescribing.",

    "content": "Need another reason to prioritize your sleep? Not spending enough time in the two deep stages of sleep — slow-wave and rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep — may hasten the deterioration of parts of the brain associated with Alzheimer’s disease, a new study found. Deficits in slow-wave and REM sleep appear to shrink parts of the brain known to be early indicators of cognitive deterioration and Alzheimer’s disease, said lead study author Gawon Cho, a postdoctoral associate in internal medicine at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. “We found the volume of a part of the brain called the inferior parietal region   shrunk in people with inadequate slow and REM sleep,” Cho said. “That part of the brain synthesizes sensory information, including visuospatial information, so it makes sense that it shows neurodegeneration early in the disease.” Preventive neurologist Dr. Richard Issacson, who established one of the first Alzheimer’s prevention clinics in the United States, said in an email that his clinical experience treating adults at risk for Alzheimer’s supports the study’s findings. “We also found sleep metrics on deeper sleep predicted cognitive function, so between that plus brain volumes, it’s real,” said Issacson, who is director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida. He was not involved in the study. During deep sleep, the brain sweeps out toxins and dead cells while also repairing and restoring the body for the next day. While we dream during REM sleep, the brain is busy processing emotions, consolidating memories and absorbing new information. It makes sense that getting quality deep and REM sleep is key to our ability to function. Adults need to be healthy, while teens and younger children need much more. However, data shows that more than 1 in 3 American adults  don’t get enough sleep, according to the . Experts say most adults should spend of their night in deep sleep, and the same goes for REM sleep. Older adults require less, while babies need much more — in fact, infants can spend of their sleep in REM. To make matters worse, deeper stages of sleep decrease as you age, Cho said. Deep sleep tends to come soon after we fall asleep, while REM sleep appears later in the night, toward morning. Therefore, if you go to bed late and get up early, you are cutting your chances of spending enough time in one or both stages. “The more time you are in bed, the more a person sleeps, and generally speaking, the longer a person sleeps, the more REM and deep sleep they will get,” Isaacson said. However, you have to do more than just lie in bed longer — you also need have to have an uninterrupted, restful sleep on a regular basis, experts say. If you do that, there’s an additional payoff — a February 2023 study found good sleep habits added to a man’s life expectancy and almost 2.5 years to a woman’s life. To accomplish this, however, you can’t wake up during the night or have trouble falling asleep more than two times a week, the study found. You also have to feel well rested at least five days a week when you wake up. And finally, you can’t be using sleep medications to achieve your good slumber. But don’t lose hope. The good news is that you can by following what is called “sleep hygiene.” It’s important to go to bed at the same time on most nights and get up at the same time most mornings — even on weekends and holidays. Make sure your sleeping environment is optimal — cooler and darker is better — and block noise or try a sound machine. Avoid booze before bed — it may seem like you’re falling asleep more easily, but when your liver finishes metabolizing the alcohol at 3 a.m., your body will wake up, experts say. Set up a sleep routine, with no blue lights or distractions at least an hour before bedtime. Try meditation, yoga, tai chi, warm baths — anything that relaxes you is great. “How do you make your sleep better? I think people really have to do their part to improve their own sleep,” Cho said. “There’s no one medicine that improves overall sleep.” .",

    "content": "Find yourself yawning a lot? Do you need that third or fourth cup of coffee to make it through the afternoon at work? Such may be a red flag of a that could put you in physical danger and harm your long-term health, according to a new position paper by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. “Sleepiness is a serious health concern with wide-reaching consequences,” said AASM President Dr. Eric Olson, a pulmonologist and sleep medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “From drowsy driving crashes to workplace errors and long-term health risks, the effects of excessive daytime sleepiness impact individuals and society every day,” Olson said in a statement about the paper, which is supported by 25 different medical organizations including the American Academy of Neurology, the National Safety Council and the American Academy of Family Physicians. Not getting a quality night’s rest of at least seven to eight hours has been linked to the development or worsening of diabetes, depression, heart and kidney disease, high blood pressure, obesity and stroke, . “With one-third of U.S. adults reporting they experience excessive sleepiness, the importance of identifying interventions that recognize, assess, and treat it cannot be understated,” Olson added. All too often people write off signs of sleepiness, such as dozing off during a work meeting, as an insignificant issue instead of a sign of a potentially dangerous sleep deficit, experts say. “Nodding off in boring meetings is an indication of insufficient sleep. Someone who is fully rested will not fall asleep in meetings, no matter how boring the meeting is,” said sleep specialist Kristen Knutson, an associate professor of neurology and preventive medicine at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. “Excessive daytime sleepiness can impair performance and be an indicator of underlying sleep disorders or other issues,” Knutson said via email. “If someone is experiencing excessive daytime sleepiness regularly, they should discuss this with their physician.” The body does odd things when it’s continuously sleepy, including overcoming those yawns and sending signals that you are, in fact, coping with the lack of sleep. However, those signals couldn’t be further from the truth, said AASM board member and second author Dr. Indira Gurubhagavatula, a professor of sleep medicine at the Veteran’s Administration Medical Center at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia. “The unfortunate thing is data shows that with chronic partial sleep deprivation the ability to perceive our own level of impairment is no longer accurate — we think we’re OK when we’re really not,” Gurubhagavatula said. “When we do actual tests to measure how well your brain is functioning — reaction time, the ability to recall, memory tests, coordination — we find people are actually making a lot of mistakes,” she said. “And it’s scary because they still have this inappropriately high level of confidence that they are OK.” With continued sleepiness, the brain may take mini naps, or what specialists call microsleeps, Gurubhagavatula said. “Your brain is actually going into brief two-second, three-second, 10-second microsleeps and then popping back out and you may not even realize this is happening,” she said. “It can be very dangerous if you’re driving or doing something that involves safety. So if you do feel like you might fall asleep, pay attention to that, as it’s an indication it’s not safe to drive.” About 100,000 car accidents a year are linked to drowsy driving, How do you know if your sleepiness is crossing into the danger zone? You can measure it on various scales, including the , Gurubhagavatula said. Questions on the test include how likely you’ll fall asleep while sitting quietly after a lunch with no alcohol; lying down in the afternoon; sitting inactive in a public place; sitting and reading; sitting and chatting with someone; riding as a passenger in a car for an hour; sitting in traffic for a few minutes while driving; and watching television. “We ask patients to rate from zero to three how likely they are to fall asleep during these eight sedentary situations,” she said. “The maximum score is 24, which indicates that you’re very, very sleepy. We generally consider scores above 10 to being clinically significant and worth intervention.” As sleep deprivation progresses, dangerous symptoms of sleepiness can increase, Gurubhagavatula said. “You have droopy eyelids, your body is slumping, you’re having trouble staying upright, and some people even notice vertigo, the room spinning, hands shaking with severe deprivation,” she said. “You can also be reckless and impulsive, like you don’t care. That’s another symptom.” Sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, insomnia, restless leg syndrome and , as well as chronic pain conditions and medications can also contribute to sleepiness, which will be ruled out by a sleep specialist. “You can also ask your pharmacist about your prescriptions, and you should also consider any over-the-counter medications,” Gurubhagavatula said. Certain lifestyle behaviors also can contribute to chronic sleepiness, experts say. “Things like too much caffeine, alcohol use before bed, using marijuana, the amount of exercise you’re doing, and practicing poor sleep hygiene, such as sleeping in a bright, cold, hot or noisy bedroom, will definitely affect how your sleep will be organized and how refreshing it’s going to be,” Gurubhagavatula said. Many people turn to alcohol or marijuana in the mistaken belief that it can improve sleep. While alcohol appears to make it easier to fall asleep, the body will wake in the middle of the night once the alcohol is metabolized, experts say. “I have patients that are very surprised how much better their sleep is when they get rid of that one drink they have with dinner,”Gurubhagavatula said. “As for marijuana, we know it actually has . The efficiency of your sleep decreases, and how tired you feel the next day increases, so sleep quality actually starts to go down.”",

    "content": "You’ve heard the rule: No TV before bed. But many people find that it helps them fall asleep if they listen to something –– audiobooks, music, podcasts or TV shows. found that more than half of people with sleep disturbances use music as a sleep aid. It is poor to look at screens to scroll or watch a show before bedtime, but what if you aren’t looking, just listening? “It’s like Goldilocks,” said sleep medicine specialist Dr. Rachel Salas, professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. “It’s a matter of what works for you …  It’s not only the practices of your bedtime routine, but your environment, all the things.” Everyone is different, and some people might get great sleep if they fall asleep listening to something, Salas said. However, there are some practices to keep in mind to make sure you are maximizing the benefits and avoiding potential pitfalls. The key to listening to audiobooks, podcasts, music or TV to fall asleep is making sure it is helping you wind down instead of waking you up, said Dr. Shalini Paruthi, sleep medicine attending physician at John J. Cochran Veterans Hospital in St. Louis and adjunct professor at St. Louis University School of Medicine. “If listening to something actually keeps a person more engaged or awake and therefore replaces sleep time, this can be detrimental to health,” she said in an email. “It is recommended that adults obtain at least 7 hours of sleep regularly for optimal performance.” On the other hand, a predictable kind of noise can help tell your body it’s time to wind down, Salas added. “If you find that that’s part of your bedtime routine, and it’s kind of comforting and relaxing … that’s great,” she said. Try choosing content to listen to that will allow you to transition into sleep, added Dr. Lindsay Browning, a psychologist and sleep expert in Berkshire in the United Kingdom. “Choose something not too engaging so that your brain isn’t motivated to stay awake and fight sleep to pay attention to it,” she said in an email. A may be a better choice than audio of a book you want to read. Shows you have heard before and know how they end might be better than falling asleep to a nailbiter. A soundtrack for sleep might help you get to sleep, but it doesn’t always keep you asleep if it keeps going all night, Browning said. “It’s important to set an auto timer to mute the sounds as soon after falling asleep as possible,” she said. If the show, podcast, or music you are playing has unexpected noises, frequencies or volumes, it might alert your brain to pay attention, Salas said. The startling noise doesn’t always wake you up fully, but it can cause many little awakenings you aren’t aware of. That will disturb your sleep nonetheless, she added. One steady sound, like white noise or , can help your sleep quality, especially if you live in a noisy area, Salas added. “(If) bars close at a certain time and people are outside, walking home and talking or yelling, that’s going to disrupt your sleep,” she said. A consistent and non-alarming noise can stifle those kinds of ambient noise, she said. Sometimes listening to something to fall asleep isn’t just a nice part of a bedtime routine –– it’s a way to quiet racing thoughts at night. Some proactive steps during the day may help, Browning said. “If you find that your brain is too active as you try to fall asleep, which keeps you awake, you could try to address those busy thoughts and worries earlier in the day,” she said. Methods include having a dedicated time earlier in the day to think about those worries or utilizing , a technique that involves thinking up random and non-emotionally charged words to take your mind off of your racing thoughts, Browning said. “It’s a much better idea to try to learn ways of quieting a busy mind at night that don’t require you to mask those unwanted thoughts with an external sound,” Browning said. If you are using listening to something to help with insomnia and it doesn’t seem to help after a two-to-four-week period, it might be time to see a board-certified sleep physician and get to the root of the problem, Paruthi said. “There are several proven therapies that work well for insomnia treatment such as cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia, or when appropriate, medications can be considered,” she said.",

    "content": "Arguments often feel urgent no matter what’s going on for some of the couples Dr. Samantha Rodman Whiten sees in her practice as a clinical psychologist in Potomac, Maryland. This desire to before heading to bed is particularly common for clients who grew up in a house where family members fought nonstop, said Whiten, author of “ : How to Reignite Intimacy and Rebuild Your Relationship.” “It doesn’t really occur to you to just shelve it and go to sleep.” For others, the tendency is because of the age-old adage that you should never go to bed angry — which sometimes comes from “the belief that unresolved anger can fester overnight, leading to deeper resentment,” said Dr. Sabrina Romanoff, a clinical psychologist in New York City, via email. “Its wisdom is likely to be rooted in the idea that resolution to arguments is essential for maintaining harmony and preventing even more emotional distance,” Romanoff said. “Historically, it’s a call for connection and prioritizing the relationship over lingering negativity.” Others’ resistance to dropping an argument for the night may stem from self-comparison or , Whiten said — which can lead you to think you should be able to quickly discuss things with your partner, apologize, resolve the issue and happily call it a night. There’s also the concern — sometimes in hindsight — about what may happen if you let your partner go about their next day with that lingering resentment between you two or without having said I love you. All considered, never going to bed angry sounds like a good rule to live by. But it isn’t always useful, Romanoff said. “Its rigidity can overlook individual needs, rest and perspective,” Romanoff said. “Applying this convention without discretion can actually be detrimental to your relationship.” Putting an argument on pause and going to sleep upset is a skill you can practice, Whiten said. Here’s how to do it and still keep your relationship intact. Delaying sleep to resolve an argument can backfire for several reasons. When you’re exhausted, you’re less inhibited and thus have less control of your emotions, so you’re more impulsive and likely to say or do things you don’t mean and will later regret, experts said. Your problem-solving, listening and reasoning skills, which are all necessary for effective communication, can take a hit too, especially if you’re really worked up. Those factors, as well as being under the influence, can further exacerbate the problem, Whiten said. A good night’s rest, however, can completely reset the brain. Sleep “reduces your brain’s reactivity to negative stimuli — or perceived negative stimuli — helps process emotions and restores your ability to approach problems rationally,” Romanoff said. “A well-rested brain is better equipped to engage in thoughtful, respectful communication.” Sometimes, what you were arguing about will no longer seem important the next day. For whatever concerns that remain, though, you’ll be more able to express them in a way that’s less emotional or defensive and, ultimately, better for the relationship. Except on the rare occasions when something important and relevant to the conflict is about to happen late at night, Romanoff said all arguments should wait until the next day. Let’s say you want to go to sleep but are struggling because the issue feels urgent, you’re lying awake ruminating while your partner is sleeping soundly, or you’re worried something bad might happen. These feelings could stem from “ ,” Whiten said. That’s the fear that your attachment figure or closest relationship, typically your parents in childhood or your partner in adulthood, isn’t there for you or doesn’t love you. “That’s very evolutionarily motivated to try to get back to a state where you feel secure in the relationship,” Whiten added. In many of these cases, people feel the only way to manage their anxiety is to immediately try to repair things. But when you’re worked up and tired, conversations with your partner won’t go as well as when you’re calm and rested. In fact, these conversations may even lead to a situation that heightens your anxiety. Regardless of why you just can’t let it go, there are things you can do to settle down enough to get restful sleep. In some relationships, one person wants to discuss conflict more than the other, Whiten said. That person may worry that if the conversation doesn’t happen right away, it never will — meaning the issue will never be resolved and the security and connection in the relationship will never be restored. That’s why experts said it’s critical for couples to commit to a time and place to follow up as soon as it’s reasonably possible and when you’re both in a better state of mind. Anticipating that things will be resolved soon can help calm you enough to sleep. Couples can also try to maintain any bedtime rituals that reinforce the foundation of the relationship, such as saying “I love you,” cuddling or kissing each other good night, Romanoff said. Still engaging in these rituals communicates that your commitment to each other is more important than your current disagreement, offering reassurance without dismissing the conflict and balancing your immediate emotional security with the need for sleep, Romanoff said. Emotions are generally fleeting, but your commitment to, and care for, your partner likely aren’t. You can even say all these things. If you’re reading this tip and thinking, “If I’m mad, there’s no way I’m saying ‘I love you,’” that stubbornness is part of what leads to frequent conflict, Romanoff said. “The more you say, ‘I can’t learn new ways of engaging,’ the less likely the relationship is to work out,” she added. “In a healthy relationship, people are always learning new skills.” You don’t have to do these things happily or romantically — a monotonous “I love you” or a brief peck can still go a long way. It’s not about denying your anger but about affirming the bond you share, Romanoff said. Self-regulating can also be important. You could , journaling, or distracting yourself by taking a quick shower or immersing your hands in cold water, Whiten said. Ask yourself, “How can I handle things in a way that will make my future self proud? How can I care for myself as a parent would care for a child who’s upset?” Learning how to soothe yourself “is the real deep work that many people do with anxious attachment, especially in therapy,” Whiten said. Whenever you do have that follow-up conversation with your partner, remember that although arguments are inevitable, how you handle them defines your relationship and sometimes your sleep health, Romanoff said. “Treat conflicts as opportunities to grow closer, not further apart,” Romanoff added. “It’s not about always maintaining a perfect relationship; it’s about growing, learning and progressing through life together, even in the messy moments.”",

    "content": "As are becoming increasingly restricted at state and federal levels, some manufacturers are looking to switch to natural dyes to color their food products. US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary announced in an April 22 briefing that the agency plans to work with industry to phase out the use of synthetic dyes in the US food supply. Those dyes are commonly used to make food and beverage products brightly colored and more appealing to consumers. They include red No. 40, yellow No. 5 and No. 6, blue No. 1 and No. 2, and green No. 3. Natural food dyes, which could replace them, are derived from vegetables, fruits, animals and minerals, according to the . Makary’s announcement is the latest move in the push to get food companies to stop using artificial dyes due to concerns about negative impacts on animal and human health — including and neurobehavioral issues. The FDA also soon aims to authorize and fast-track the review of others, including Galdieria extract blue, gardenia blue, butterfly pea flower extract and calcium phosphate. “The FDA is asking food companies to (voluntarily) substitute petrochemical dyes with natural ingredients for American children,” Makary said in . “… Given the growing concerns of doctors and parents about the potential role of petroleum-based food dyes, we should not be taking risks and do everything possible to safeguard the health of our children.” The FDA announcement follows significant shifts in the legal landscape around food additives over the last two years. California statewide in October 2023, followed by a ban of six other common dyes in school foods . The FDA in January, effective for food on January 15, 2027, and for drugs on January 18, 2028 — but the agency is now asking food companies to eliminate the dye sooner. And in March, West Virginia passed the thus far, prohibiting seven dyes and two preservatives. “For a couple of decades, at least, there has been a lot of questioning from consumers about the safety of synthetics, and the demand for more natural ingredients has been on the rise,” said Dr. Monica Giusti, professor and associate chair of the food science and technology department at Ohio State University. “Finally, we have seen some type of regulatory action.” Some natural dyes are already being used in products sold in the United States, and some stores have policies barring the sale of foods with synthetic dyes, said Melanie Benesh, vice president of governmental affairs at the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit environmental health organization. CNN contacted the FDA and the US Department of Health and Human Services for comment but did not hear back in time for publication. Here are the alternative dyes and how they could affect manufacturers and human health. Many natural dyes are already and than their artificial counterparts. The FDA requires manufacturers submit samples of batches of synthetic colors for testing and certification. Natural color additives are exempt but still evaluated by the agency. One of the most popular alternatives for vibrant red colorants is cochineal extract or its lake, carmine. (A lake is a fat-soluble version of a dye.) Cochineal dyes are from the tiny dried and crushed bodies of female cochineal insects mostly and easily harvested from cacti in Peru, Giusti said. So intensely colored that just crushing them with your fingers will leave a stain, cochineal insects have been used as colorants for centuries, dating back to that began in the 13th century, Giusti added. Other natural dyes include annatto extract (yellow) from the seeds of the tropical tree Bixa orellana and blue-to-brown colorants produced from juiced, powdered or dehydrated beets, experts said. There’s also beta-carotene (yellow or orange) found in many plants including carrots; grape skin extract (red or purple); the orange- and red-hued spices turmeric and saffron; and , spirulina extract and matcha, experts said. “There are various processing methods for naturally derived food colors, with some colors having multiple methods available,” said Renee Leber, food science and technical services manager at the Institute of Food Technologists, a nonprofit scientific organization of food professionals and technologists, via email. The institute’s membership includes people working in food production. Research on the effects of artificial dyes on human health is still underfunded, so there’s even less support for studies on natural alternatives, experts said. But generally, “compounds that give color to fruits and vegetables tend to have additional beneficial properties for human health,” such as anti-inflammatory agents, Giusti said. A small percentage of consumers reactions ranging in severity from hives to , which can be fatal, after consuming products containing cochineal insect dyes, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest. The ingredients have therefore “been identified as allergenic substances that must be declared on the label of all food and cosmetic products,” . “There’s some protein in these dyes to which some people are allergic,” said Dr. Marion Nestle, Paulette Goddard Professor of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health, Emerita, at New York University. “That could occur in sensitive people with very, very small quantities.” But with most natural dyes coming from plants and being used in small quantities, “it’s hard to believe they’d have any effect” on the general population, added Nestle, also visiting professor of nutritional sciences at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Even if natural dyes may generally be safer for human health, there is industry concern about potential impact on product appeal and feasibility. One reason why manufacturers prefer petroleum-based dyes is that their chemical structure doesn’t change much when combined with other ingredients, stored over time and exposed to elements, Giusti said. While cochineal insects provide intense, stable colors, dyes from plant materials are less stable. That difference is “very challenging for companies, because, for example, if a company produces 10 different products that are red, they could be using one synthetic colorant,” Giusti said. “But if they want to replace the synthetic colorant with a natural alternative, they may need to use up to 10 different natural colorants.” And although there are more than 40 different alternatives of natural colorants, they can’t produce the spectrum of color that the several synthetic dyes can. These factors may cause products containing natural dyes to be more expensive than those with synthetic colors. Converting just one product from a synthetic dye to a natural colorant can take six months to a year, officials at Sensient Technologies Corp., one of the largest global dye-makers helping businesses change their protocols, . “It’s not like there’s 150 million pounds of beet juice sitting around waiting on the off chance the whole market may convert,” Paul Manning, the company’s chief executive, told the AP. “Tens of millions of pounds of these products need to be grown, pulled out of the ground, extracted.” It’s the same supply issue with cochineal dyes. Roughly 70,000 cochineal insects are needed to produce about 2.2 pounds, or 1 kilogram, of dye, the AP reported. Some food companies have previously received backlash when switching to natural dyes, with some consumers reporting a difference in taste. But Nestle said these experiences are likely biased perceptions since products’ compositions otherwise typically remain the same. Companies have “managed to get rid of them in other countries and substitute vegetable dyes,” Nestle said. “This seems like a no-brainer to me.” CNN’s Meg Tirrell and Jen Christensen contributed to this report.",

    "content": "American adults say at the grocery store is making it harder for them to have a healthy diet, according to a nationally representative survey of adults by the , a nonpartisan fact tank that conducts data-driven research. Ninety percent of adults in the United States say the price of healthy food has risen over the past few years, and over two-thirds (69%) say higher food prices are making it difficult to eat a healthy diet. Those with fixed or lower incomes were hardest hit, with 47% reporting difficulty in eating healthy meals compared with only 15% of upper-income adults, according to the survey of 5,123 adults conducted during the week of February 24 to March 2. “It is a bigger challenge for the lower-income adults, but it’s not as if the middle- and upper-income Americans are completely spared,” said Eileen Yam, director of science and society research at Pew, which is based in Washington, DC. “Even middle- and upper-income Americans are reporting the increased price of healthy food is making it more difficult to eat healthy,” Yam said. That’s partly due to a reliance on a Westernized diet that focuses on costly animal foods, such as meat and dairy, said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine who founded the nonprofit , a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine. He was not involved in the Pew survey. “ are stunningly nutritious, and very economical. Cooking grains are highly nutritious, and very economical,” Katz said in an email. “More dishes featuring these, and fewer featuring costly animal foods, would allow for a decisive improvement in diet quality while lowering overall cost. “So, too, of course, would r and less sugar-sweetened beverages,” he added. “The impediment , but food label literacy.” More than 1 million Americans from diet-related diseases such as obesity, cancer, heart disease and type 2 diabetes, while unhealthy diets and food insecurity cost the United States an in health care expenditures and lost productivity annually. Objective measures of diet quality in the US conducted by scientists show that the American diet is substandard. Over 50% of adults fail to meet of the American Heart Association, an found. Regardless, nearly 60% of adults in the Pew survey rated their diets as somewhat healthy. “Americans’ ability to report the quality of their diet is highly suspect,” Katz said. “We do not rely on people to ‘guesstimate’ their own blood pressure; we should not be expecting them to ‘guesstimate’ their diet quality either.” People who ate more meals at home were most likely to rate their diets as healthy, the survey found. About one-third of Americans who cook and eat at home rated their diets as extremely or very healthy. However, only 12% of those who ate out more often considered their diet satisfactory. Taste is the most important factor in choosing food, with 83% of adults listing taste as extremely or very important, according to the survey. Less than 50% of respondents said the same about the healthiness of food, however. “Whether we’re looking at race, ethnicity, gender, income, taste is way up there at the top,” Yam said. “After taste, Americans care most about cost, the healthiness of the food and then convenience.” Low cost, convenience and taste are hallmarks of ultraprocessed foods. Food manufacturers entice consumers with combinations of sugar, salt, fat and additives designed to meet a “bliss point” of tastiness. In the United States, some may be ultraprocessed, a 2019 study estimated. Ultraprocessed foods contain ingredients “never or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,” according to the . Numerous studies find of raise the risk of obesity and the development of chronic conditions including , , , and . Such foods may even . Research also shows that switching to a plant-based diet, such as the can improve health at any age. “It’s never too late to adopt healthy eating patterns, and the benefits of eating a healthy diet can be substantial in terms of reducing total premature deaths and different causes of premature death,” said Dr. Frank Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology and chair of the department of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “People also have a lot of flexibility in terms of creating their own healthy dietary pattern,” Hu told CNN in a . “But the common principles — eating more-plant based foods and fewer servings of red meat, processed meats, added sugar and sodium — should be there, no matter what kind of diet that you want to create.” .",

    "content": "Eating about a dozen servings of ultraprocessed food each day could more than double your risk of developing Parkinson’s disease, according to a new study. A single serving in the study was 8 ounces of diet or sugar-sweetened soda, a single hot dog, one slice of packaged cake, a mere tablespoon of ketchup or 1 ounce of potato chips — a typical small bag of chips is 1.5 ounces. “Our research shows that eating too much processed food, like sugary sodas and packaged snacks, might be speeding up early signs of Parkinson’s disease,” said senior study author Dr. Xiang Gao, a distinguished professor and dean of the Institute of Nutrition at Fudan University in Shanghai, China, in a statement. This latest study is part of the “growing evidence that diet might influence the development of Parkinson’s disease,” Gao said. While the study found that people who ate more ultraprocessed foods tended to report more early symptoms, it did not find a direct increase in the risk of Parkinson’s disease itself, said Dr. Daniel van Wamelen, a clinical senior lecturer in neuroscience at King’s College London. He was not involved in the new research. “The study did not track whether participants were diagnosed with Parkinson’s later on,” van Wamelen said in a statement. “That said, having more of these symptoms suggests a higher risk over time.” The study analyzed years of health and diet data on nearly 43,000 participants of the and , two studies in the United States that have been gathering information on health behaviors for decades. The average age of people in the study was 48, and none had Parkinson’s disease at the beginning of the study. All self-reported what they ate every few years — a limitation of the new research as participants may not have remembered their food intake accurately. Ultraprocessed foods measured by the study included artificially or sugar-sweetened beverages; condiments, sauces and spreads; packaged sweets snacks or desserts; yogurt or dairy-based desserts; breads and cereals; and packaged savory snacks. The study found a link between early signs of Parkinson’s disease and all types of ultraprocessed foods except breads and cereals — a finding that indicates an underlying feature among most classes of ultraprocessed foods that may explain the results, the study said. One reason could be ultraprocessed foods typically have less dietary fiber, protein and micronutrients — but do have added sugar, salt, and saturated or trans fats, the study said. Ultraprocessed foods also may impact the balance of flora in the gut, while additives may increase inflammation, free radicals and neuron death, the study said. “With a sample size exceeding 42,800 participants and a long follow-up period up to 26 years, this study stands out not only for its power but also for its methodological rigor,” wrote the authors of a published with the study. The editorial was coauthored by Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, an associate professor of clinical neurology at Columbia University in New York City, and dietitian Maria Maraki, an assistant professor of sports medicine and exercise biology at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece. Neither were involved in the new research. “The prevention of neurodegenerative diseases may begin at the dinner table,” they wrote. “Excessive UPF consumption not only is a risk factor for metabolic diseases but may also accelerate neurodegenerative processes and associated symptoms.” In the new study, in the journal Neurology, researchers looked at the prodromal stage of Parkinson’s disease — early signals that appear years to decades before the tremors, stiff muscles, slow gait and changes in posture that are of Parkinson’s. Body pain, constipation, signs of depression, changes in the ability to smell or see colors, and excessive daytime sleepiness can all be early signs of Parkinson’s disease, according to the An extremely unusual sleep disorder, in which people can move during REM, or the rapid eye movement stage of sleep, is also a key early sign, . The body is typically paralyzed during REM sleep so it cannot get up and act out any dreams. The study found that people who ate about 11 servings a day of ultraprocessed food — compared to people who only ate three — had a 2.5-fold greater likelihood of exhibiting three or more of the early signs of Parkinson’s. In addition, eating more ultraprocessed foods was tied to an increased risk for nearly all symptoms except constipation, according to the study. This finding held true even after researchers accounted for other factors, such as age, physical activity and smoking, that might impact the results. “Parkinson’s is an incurable disease,” Gao said in an email. “In our based on the same populations used for the current analysis, we found that a healthy dietary pattern and physical activity could slow the disease progression. “Choosing to eat fewer processed foods and more whole, nutritious foods could be a good strategy for maintaining brain health.” Mediterranean Style.",

    "title": "\n      Did 8 Italian physicists make the perfect cacio e pepe? I tested their experiment to find out\n    ",

    "content": "Few things are as impressive to dinner party guests as a perfectly executed à la minute pasta dish. As a Roman-born foodie, I would argue that cacio e pepe, a Roman pasta recipe that is as delicious and simple as it is finicky, is a bold menu choice for the novice cook. The name says it all: pasta, cacio (cheese) and pepe (pepper). That’s it. That’s the recipe. “There is no margin for error with just pasta, Pecorino Romano cheese, and black pepper,” Michele Casadei Massari, CEO and executive chef of Lucciola Italian Restaurant in Manhattan, told CNN via email. “The main challenge lies in achieving a stable emulsion: If the cheese is overheated or the starch-water balance is wrong, the sauce will separate,” Massari said. When that happens, the pecorino forms a gloopy cheesy mess, sticking to everything but the noodles — sad and naked. So, how can one reliably avoid unpleasant dinnertime disasters? Either by practicing a lot — and inevitably making mistakes in the process, as I have — or by using science to guide the way. Eight Italian physicists collaborated to crack the code of a foolproof cacio e pepe recipe, studying the properties of cheese, starch and water at different temperatures to learn how to replicate a flawless dish every time. The study was published April 29 in the journal . The magic trick? Adding a precise amount of cornstarch relative to the overall quantity of cheese used, to keep the dreaded clumps at bay. When I first heard about the method, the Roman cuisine purist in me was skeptical. Too many times, I’ve read cheat sheets for the perfect carbonara dish in which the solution to perfect, non-scrambled-egg sauce is to add cream (please, do not do this). In the interest of objectivity, I had to test the recipe myself and talk to these fellow Italians behind the research. In a conversation in Italian, three of the study authors shared that the research came from their frustration for one too many cacio e pepe dishes gone wrong. Thanks to the group’s familiarity with the concept of “liquid-liquid phase separation,” they knew how to investigate the problem scientifically. “At some point, the eight of us were all at the Max Planck Institute in Dresden (Germany), some as PhD students, some as postdocs,” said study coauthor Daniel Maria Busiello, a statistical physicist at Italy’s University of Padova. At that time, “something we’d often do was cooking Italian recipes, not just for Italians, but for others as well.” Making big batches of cacio e pepe to feed other hungry scientists turned out to be a near-impossible feat. “There were problems with controlling the temperature of the sauce and of the noodles, causing these clumps,” Busiello said. “I remember a time the dish came out inedible. Something clicked then,” said study coauthor Ivan Di Terlizzi, one of the group’s top cooks, and a statistical physicist at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden. Di Terlizzi approached fellow researcher Giacomo Bartolucci, now a biophysicist at the University of Barcelona in Spain, with a working theory about possible commonalities between the behavior of cacio e pepe sauce and that of aqueous solutions of proteins inside cells. Bartolucci had focused on phase separation and the aggregation of proteins for his doctoral research. The scientists set out to understand whether the cheese and water in this recipe could be scientifically described as “a system that undergoes phase separation at high temperatures,” in Busiello’s words. “We had a theoretical framework and a practical problem,” Busiello added. Innovating on traditional Italian recipes, even on solid scientific grounds, is a high-risk endeavor. Given the touchy subject, the study authors are of course all Italians, by design. “If we have to piss off a bunch of people, at least let it be eight Italians who did it,” Di Terlizzi said. To investigate the behavior of cacio e pepe sauce under heat, the researchers conducted experiments recreating the cooking process in a controlled setup. “We prepared small batches of sauce using precise amounts of cheese, starch, and water, and gradually heated them using a sous vide device to carefully control the temperature,” Di Terlizzi explained. “At each stage, we took a small sample of the sauce, placed it in a petri dish and photographed it from above to observe how clumps formed. This allowed us to track how changes in temperature and ingredients affected the smoothness of the sauce.” The researchers found that the concentration of starch in the sauce is the key factor influencing its stability. If the proportion of starch falls below 1% of the total cheese weight, the cheese will enter what the authors call the “Mozzarella phase” — in which clumps are inescapable and the dish is ruined — at lower temperatures. A 2% to 3% starch-to-cheese ratio yields the best results. In the recipe for two published in the study, the researchers used 5 grams (0.18 ounce) of cornstarch or potato starch dissolved in water, heated up gently to form a gel, then cooled down with more water before being blended with 200 grams (7 ounces) of pecorino cheese. Sodium citrate, a common additive used to make smooth mac and cheese, also worked well in their recipe, although according to Di Terlizzi it lent the dish a slightly “cheese single” aftertaste. The scientifically engineered pecorino cream can withstand temperature changes better than the classic cheese-starchy water mixture made with pasta cooking water and can even be reheated. Temperature is in fact another key factor that can make or break the sauce, which has to do with how the proteins in the cheese behave when heated. “The sauce is stable if created at low temperatures and the starch bonded with the proteins. If, after that happens, you expose the sauce to high temperatures, proteins can no longer interact,” Di Terlizzi said. If the emulsion of cheese and starch happens at high temperatures though, “there’s no guarantee that proteins will bond with other proteins, which causes the aggregation, before they bond with the starch.” The scientifically optimized recipe will yield solid results for large batches of pasta, as the stable sauce will give you more flexibility dealing with a large volume of piping hot noodles, cooling down more slowly than a smaller batch of pasta would. When trying the scientifically optimized recipe, don’t throw away all the pasta cooking water! You’ll still need some of it in the final mixing of all ingredients (the “mantecatura” in Italian). Just be careful to let it cool down slightly. When I tested the recipe, the instructions felt straightforward, and the process was quick, though it required a few more steps than what I’m used to (such as forming the starch gel on the stove). It was frankly odd to work with a pecorino cream that felt so smooth — it almost reminded me of a jarred sauce. Nothing changes as far as the pepper goes. Just crack as much of it as you’d like and toast it in a pan to release its aroma. My husband and I enjoyed the dish. It tasted great, and dealing with a pecorino cream that needs much less babying at the stove and allows for a much less time-sensitive mantecatura is a definite plus. Also, who doesn’t love the idea of a cacio e pepe party for a crowd? My only qualm is that knowing there was starch added in the sauce, my perception of the dish’s mouthfeel was definitely skewed, but that wasn’t the case for my husband. As a proud Roman home cook, my pursuit of a perfect classic cacio e pepe will be a life-long experiment, but the scientifically optimized recipe exceeded my expectations and would be a good initiation for home cooks who have been put off by the dish’s treachery thus far. But what exactly makes the traditional way of making this dish, by emulsifying the cheese with pasta cooking water, so challenging? It’s practically impossible to know just how much starch is naturally present in the pasta cooking water, so the success of the crucial emulsion is more of a gamble, but there are tricks to mitigate catastrophe. One, coming from Massari, is to use less water to boil the pasta. “For cacio e pepe, I recommend using about 6 to 8 cups of water for 7 ounces of pasta, which translates to a ratio closer to 1 part pasta to 6–7 parts water by weight — significantly less than in traditional pasta cooking,” the chef said. A classic rule of thumb for cooking pasta, according to Massari, is to use about 1 quart of water for every 3½ ounces of pasta, and 2 teaspoons of salt. The researchers, who used an arbitrary 10-to-1 ratio of water to pasta in their experiments, also said that reducing that volume of water by two-thirds generally concentrated the natural pasta starch to a safe degree. Massari also recommends emulsifying the cheese and pasta water below 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit), which is in line with the new study’s findings on temperature. “I first create a cold cheese cream, using finely grated Pecorino and a small amount of the pasta’s starchy cooking water, blending until smooth. Then, I toss the pasta off the heat with the cream and freshly cracked black pepper, adding extra water to adjust the texture,” Massari said. “The result should be a silky, cohesive sauce that clings beautifully to every strand of pasta, not a broken or heavy coating.” “The natural starch from properly handled pasta is more than sufficient to achieve a creamy, stable, and authentic sauce without compromising the nutritional integrity of the dish,” Massari added. Another chef’s trick to buy you some time while attempting the recipe the traditional way is “pasta regeneration” — which involves partially cooking the pasta for about 70% of its time, immediately shocking it in ice water to stop gelatinization and finishing it later before serving. “This method preserves al dente texture while enhancing the final release of surface starch, which is crucial for stabilizing delicate emulsions,” Massari explained. The researchers said their scientifically optimized recipe has surged to meme status, online and offline. “Some social media users were hypercritical about the recipe we proposed, despite it being used before in prestigious restaurants,” Di Terlizzi told CNN. “Overall, I can say that excitement prevailed, especially in the scientific community,” he added. “We won’t say we invented the definitive method,” Di Terlizzi said, but this method will save you from ruining good, expensive and hard-to-source pecorino cheese. For the researchers, that’s personal: “We’re in Germany. We have that shipped to us all the way from Italy. We can’t just buy it at the store every day,” Di Terlizzi said. “So, when the dish turns out badly, that bothers us.” A big pasta dinner celebrated the publication of the paper, with the researchers preparing at least 4 pounds of pasta for a crowd. “We were on pins and needles because our diners all knew about the experiment — but it worked perfectly,” Busiello said. Bartolucci added, “That was our trial by fire.” This is CNN’s summary of the recipe presented in the study. You can find Pecorino Romano DOP — which stands for Protected Designation of Origin, a certification of a product’s origin and quality assigned by the Italian government and the European Union — and tonnarelli pasta at Italian grocers and online specialty stores. Serves 2 • Salt • 5 grams (2 teaspoons) cracked black peppercorns, plus more for serving • 5 grams (2 teaspoons) cornstarch or potato starch • 200 grams (1 ½ cups, firmly packed) pregrated Pecorino Romano DOP (such as Fulvi, Locatelli or Cello), plus more for serving • 300 grams (10.6 ounces) pasta, preferably tonnarelli (spaghetti or rigatoni also work well) 1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 2. While the water comes to a boil, add peppercorns in a single layer to a dry pan over medium-low heat. Toast until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove pepper from heat immediately. 3. Make the starch gel. In a small saucepan, dissolve the cornstarch by whisking it into 50 grams (3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon) cold water. Heat the mixture gently over low heat until it thickens and turns nearly clear. Remove the starch gel from heat and whisk in 100 grams (6 ¾ tablespoons) water to cool. The mixture will return to a liquid state. 4. Make the pecorino cream. Add the starchy water, grated cheese and peppercorns to the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine until a smooth cream forms. 5. Cook the pasta according to the package directions until al dente, reserving 237 milliliters (1 cup) of pasta water before draining. Drain the pasta and let cool for up to 1 minute. 6. Mix the pasta with the sauce, ensuring even coating, and adjust the consistency by gradually adding pasta water as needed. Keep the sauce slightly runny as it tends to thicken as it cools. If needed, the dish can withstand gentle reheating (up to 80 or 90 C, 176 to 194 F) to reach serving temperature. 7. Sprinkle with additional grated cheese and pepper and serve immediately. “I recommend using high-quality spaghettoni pasta made from durum wheat semolina, bronze-extruded and slow-dried at low temperatures,” Massari told CNN. “I prefer using Matt, a heritage durum wheat cultivated mainly in Puglia and Sicily.” You can find matt spaghettoni, Sarawak black peppercorns and Pecorino Romano DOP at online specialty stores. Serves 2 • Sea salt, preferably coarse Sicilian sea salt • 5 grams (1 teaspoon) freshly cracked Sarawak black peppercorns, plus more for serving • 100 grams (1 cup, firmly packed) pregrated Pecorino Romano DOP (such as Fulvi, Locatelli or Cello), plus more for serving • 200 grams (7 ounces) spaghettoni, preferably matt durum wheat spaghettoni 1. Bring 6 to 8 cups of lightly salted water to a boil in a large pot. Toast the black pepper in a dry pan over medium-low heat until fragrant. Remove pepper from heat immediately. 2. Cook the spaghettoni according to the package directions until slightly al dente, reserving 237 grams (1 cup) of cooking liquid while it’s cooking. 3. While the pasta is cooking, prepare a cold emulsion by mixing grated Pecorino Romano with a small ladle of warm pasta water (ideally under 60 C, or 140 F) in a medium bowl until it forms a creamy base. 4. Drain the pasta slightly al dente, then transfer it to the pan with the pepper. 5. Toss the pasta with the Pecorino cream, gradually adjusting with more pasta water to create a glossy, smooth sauce that perfectly coats the noodles. Add more black pepper and cheese before serving. Serve immediately.",

    "content": "Mediterranean Style. Throughout more than two decades of developing new recipes as “ ,” Lisa Lillien has amassed quite the collection of appliances. Her kitchen counter is lined with an air fryer, slow cooker, Instant pot, blender, and more. But if you ask Lillien, who says, “I’m not a dietitian, I’m not a nutritionist, I’m just hungry,” there’s one tool she comes back to again and again: the sheet pan. “Why sheet pans right now? I hear from my email subscribers often, and nearly everybody wants easier and faster options,” Lillien said. “Sheet pans really are an MVP of the kitchen because you can place something on the pan, pop it in the oven and you can go about your day.” Unlike some of those other tools, it won’t take up precious counter space and often is available for less than $20. “I’m not a cooking snob. I don’t think you need a certain pan, and it certainly doesn’t have to be expensive,” Lillien said, noting that the sheet pan she swears by has been in her arsenal since 1999. The ingredients you cook on it need not be exclusive, either. “We’re not promoting that you go buy every grocery from a boutique grocery store,” she noted. “Hungry Girl is more Walmart than Vanity Fair. I mean that in the best way possible; it’s just for everybody. As am I. I want to make smarter, better food choices, but I also love food.” That’s the philosophy behind her entire , which includes free daily emails with recipes and healthy cooking tips, a magazine, a podcast (that often reviews products available at major online and in-person retailers), and 16 cookbooks. In the latest, “ : One-Pan Wonders Under 400 Calories,” Lillien shares under-400-calorie recipe ideas for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, sides and desserts — all made on a sheet pan. “Sheet pans can do it all: baking, roasting, broiling and even serving,” Lillien wrote in her book. They’re “a breeze to clean. Plus, the raised edges help contain oven spills and drips.” Taking a cue  from popular fast      food restaurant menu items, viral food trends  and beloved comfort foods, the cookbook includes one-pan tricks to make every  meal easier. We asked Lillien to coach us through an entire day of sheet pan  eats. When flapjacks are doctored up with a big pat of butter and generous shower of maple syrup, “pancakes are not always the healthiest. They’re not always easy to cook evenly, either,” Lillien said. “When I make pancakes with a skillet or griddle, I often end up burning the later batches because the heat of the pan can be challenging to control.” Lillien sought a solution, which she found and integrated into her recipes for brownie, strawberry and blueberry pancake bars. A sheet pan cooks the batter evenly and allows you to make a week’s worth of pancake squares that you can enjoy now, refrigerate for tomorrow or freeze for later. To try this at home: Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and spritz it with oil or nonstick cooking spray. Mix up your favorite pancake batter. (Lillien digs a whole wheat flour-based blend for a fiber boost.) Pour it into the prepared sheet pan, sprinkle on any desired toppings, like berries or chocolate chips. and bake at 425 degrees Fahrenheit for about 15 to 17 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the center springs back when you touch it. Typically, if you attempted to recreate a fast food value meal at home, you’d need a deep fryer, grill or griddle, and perhaps a skillet to cook some of the toppings, such as onions or bacon. But Lillien’s “ultimate lunch” — In-N-Out Burger copycat Animal-Style Burger Patties — shows how to DIY on sheet pans. You could try this same concept with any burger and fries you like. For her fast      food-inspired midday meal, it all starts with the sauce. In a small bowl, stir together ⅓ cup Thousand Island dressing (light, if you like), 2 tablespoons finely minced onion, ½ teaspoon sugar      and ½ teaspoon white wine vinegar. If you have another favorite burger sauce, feel free to swap that in. Then prepare  ¼-pound burger patties with whatever meat and seasonings you desire. (Lillien  likes 95% lean ground beef jazzed up with garlic powder, onion powder, salt  and black pepper — the same spice blend she uses to season the  fries.) Place the  burgers and 2 cups of chopped onion on one sheet pan, and fry-shaped spears of  turnips or any root vegetable or sturdy squash on another. Bake at 425      F until the fries are crispy, the onions are  tender      and  the burgers are cooked to your preferred doneness level. Top a serving of  fries with a patty, a spoonful of sauce, a scoop of cooked onions and a slice  of cheddar cheese. Bake until the sauce is hot and the cheese is melty. An often-overlooked benefit of sheet pan cooking, according to Lillien, is the ability to multitask. The large cooking surface makes it possible to cook multiple items on the same sheet without overcrowding. One of Lillien’s favorite recipes in the book, Honey Mustard Pretzel Salmon with Roasted Carrots, asks for just 35 minutes and six ingredients, and leaves you with a well-balanced main dish and a side. “Honey  mustard is such a good flavor-booster. It’s very versatile and so low in  calories,” Lillien said, and it works like the “glue” to adhere the crushed  pretzels. “The richness of the salmon works so nicely with the tang and the  sweetness of the honey mustard and the salty pretzels.” Serves 2 10 minutes 35 minutes 45 minutes",

    "content": "Whether you’re swinging a bat, reaching for your seat belt or simply turning to look over your shoulder, your ability to rotate affects everything from sports performance to daily life. Yet, for many people, rotation is a struggle — leading to stiffness, discomfort and . While professional baseball players train for optimal rotational ability to maximize power and prevent injury, the same principles can benefit anyone. By improving mid-back (thoracic spine) and rib cage mobility, you can enhance your ability to rotate, alleviate pain and move through life with greater ease and lower risk of injury. Many people don’t recognize the importance of healthy thoracic spine rotation until they experience low back pain. That’s because the lower back (lumbar spine) isn’t built for rotation — its primary job is stability. But when the mid-back lacks mobility, the body often compensates by twisting more through the lower back, leading to strain, discomfort and an increased risk of injury. What’s often overlooked is the role of the rib cage in thoracic spine rotation. The thoracic spine consists of 12 vertebrae, spanning from the base of your neck to just above your lower back. Because your ribs attach to each of the vertebrae of the thoracic spine, you can’t rotate your spine independently of them. This is why breathing mechanics are critical — your breath drives rib movement, and rib movement allows for better spinal rotation. Modern lifestyles play a significant role in mid-back and rib cage stiffness. Long hours spent sitting at a desk, driving or looking at screens promote poor posture, where the upper back rounds forward, compressing the rib cage and restricting movement. Shallow chest breathing further stiffens the rib cage, reinforcing this limited mobility. Athletes aren’t immune to this issue either. Repetitive movements — such as swinging a baseball bat or golf club, throwing a ball or lifting weights without functional thoracic mobility — can create imbalances that limit rotation and increase injury risk. In baseball, a player’s ability to generate power through a swing or throw depends on seamless thoracic rotation. If mobility is restricted, performance suffers, and injury risk climbs. That’s why Toronto Blue Jays Major League head strength coach Scott Weberg emphasizes the importance of continuously evaluating rotational movement. “We assess our players’ rotational patterns year-round — not just during spring training but also during the season and postseason,” Weberg said. “Each transition presents different challenges and changes to their thoracic rotation and rib mobility that need to be addressed to optimize performance and prevent injury.” Too often, people try to “stretch out” the tension they feel in their lower back, not realizing that, if they also feel limited in their ability to twist, the problem is likely coming from the middle of their back. The solution is to restore mobility in the thoracic spine and rib cage, so the body can rotate as designed, reducing stress on the lower back. As someone who has worked in professional baseball for 20 years, I’ve seen firsthand how improving thoracic and rib mobility through can enhance performance, alleviate back pain and prevent injuries. “Breathing mechanics play a crucial role in the mobility of the thoracic spine, allowing the other segments of the spine in the neck and low back to operate as they are meant to — as stability,” Weberg added. These same principles apply to anyone looking to move with greater ease. If you only did two exercises for better rotation, these would be the ones I would recommend, as they are foundational in every professional baseball training program I create. They are designed to leverage your breathing to improve rib cage and thoracic spine mobility to unlock better rotation, strengthen core stability and improve posture. If you’re familiar with my , the only difference in this version is that you don’t lift your hips. Lie on your back with knees bent and feet hip-width apart, holding a foam yoga block or rolled towel between your knees. Place your hands on your lower ribs to guide and monitor their movement with each breath. Exhale fully, drawing your lower ribs in toward each other as your core activates and your rib cage moves down. At the end of your exhale, without inhaling, tilt your pelvis and tuck your tailbone     to flatten your lower back against the floor. Hold this position using core strength to maintain contact between your lower back and the floor without arching. Take five long, deep breaths, focusing on how your breathing moves your lower ribs: •     On exhales, engage your core to move your lower ribs in, back and down, narrowing your infrasternal angle (the upside-down “V” space separating your lower ribs). •     On inhales, feel your hands expand out to the sides as your ribs externally rotate. Focus on horizontal rib movement, avoiding excessive vertical expansion that overly recruits the pecs, neck and upper traps. Fully exhale each breath, emptying your lungs as much as possible, making your exhales longer than your inhales. Perform two sets for a total of 10 breaths. This drill improves breathing mechanics, optimizing thoracic rotation by enhancing rib mobility, core strength and low-back stability. Start standing, then exhale as you squat down and place your hands on your upper shins. Keeping hold of your left shin, inhale as you reach your right arm forward and up, rotating from your shoulder, mid-back and rib cage to open up to the right. Try to stack your shoulders vertically, reaching your right fingertips toward the ceiling while straightening your right leg only. You should feel a stretch in the back of your right leg and across your lower right back. Hold the position and take five long, deep breaths, using your breath to deepen the rotation: • On inhales, focus on expanding the open side of your rib cage (the side you’re turning toward). • On exhales, engage your side waist muscles to internally rotate the opposite side of your ribs, reinforcing thoracic rotation. Unwind back to standing, then perform the movement, rotating to the left. If you have trouble squatting low enough to hold your shins, you can or other convenient, supportive surface. This exercise integrates thoracic rotation with breath-driven rib cage movement to improve spinal mobility while reducing compensatory   stress on the lower back. Practice these two exercises a few times a week as stand-alone mobility drills or incorporated into your workouts as part of your warm-up. Remember, rotational mobility isn’t just for baseball players — it’s essential for anyone who wants to move better, avoid pain and reduce the risk of injury.",

    "content": "Spring is in the air, but that’s not stopping fitness enthusiasts from wanting to crank up the heat — at least in the studio. No matter the temperature outside, heated yoga, Pilates or spin classes are drawing in those eager to sweat it out. These heated workouts are everywhere, with studio temperatures ranging from a toasty 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29.4 degrees Celsius) to more than 100 F (37.8 C). There might be something undeniably satisfying about working up a sweat, watching the droplets roll down your skin and leaving you with a red-faced glow. But does this trendy workout regimen lead to better workout results? Beyond the immediate feel-good factor, heated workouts may have some positive physical and mental perks. These workouts increase blood flow and warm muscle tissue, which can enhance flexibility, according to Dr. Dominic King, a sports medicine physician at the Cleveland Clinic. In addition to reducing stiffness and potentially preventing injuries, the elevated temperature slightly boosts cardiovascular demand, possibly burning more calories than a standard workout at a regular temperature. However, heat alone doesn’t guarantee better fitness results. Consistency, technique and overall effort are still important. “Heated workouts add intensity, but turning up the thermostat doesn’t automatically turn up your fitness gains — sweat smartly, not just profusely,” King said. You might also get a small mental boost from the heat-related endorphin release, which King said can offer short-term relaxation similar to the effects of sitting in a sauna. But despite their popularity, heated workouts aren’t a fitness or health cure-all. In fact, working out in higher temperatures can reduce exercise intensity, according to S. Tony Wolf, an assistant professor in the department of kinesiology at the University of Georgia. He added that higher temperatures can increase physiological strain, which could diminish the quality and any smaller benefits of heated exercise. “Regular exercise routines and mindful movement in comfortable environments can offer comparable, and more sustainable, health benefits,” King said. If you already love hot classes or are curious to try one, your safety should come first. Eelevated temperatures can increase the risk of dehydration, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and fainting or exacerbate underlying heart, respiratory or kidney issues, King said. Before heading into class, it’s essential to stay hydrated. About two to three hours before a class, King recommends drinking 16 to 20 ounces of water, plus another 8 ounces about 30 minutes beforehand. As soon as the workout is over, replenish your fluids with 16 to 24 ounces of water, ideally with some form of electrolytes — sodium, potassium and magnesium — to replace lost minerals from extreme sweating. During class, be sure to look out for warning signs that your body is struggling to handle the heat, such as dizziness, nausea, confusion, rapid heartbeat or fatigue, Wolf said. Additionally, if you experience severe or unusual chest, joint or muscle pain, stop immediately and seek medical advice to rule out any underlying conditions before returning to intense workouts, King said. While young, healthy adults can generally handle the heat, some people should proceed with caution — or avoid these workouts altogether. Older adults and individuals with cardiovascular disease should check with their doctor before trying heated workouts, as the added heart strain can be dangerous, Wolf said. Pregnant people, especially in the first trimester, are at risk of overheating, which can affect fetal development, and they should avoid these classes. Anyone managing chronic health conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes or asthma, should also be mindful of the risks. “Just because it’s popular, doesn’t mean it’s right for everyone,” King said. “Fitness should enhance your health, never jeopardize it.”",

    "content": "You’re scrolling through your phone when you stumble upon the next viral trend: an influencer claiming that following their incredibly strict diet will help you achieve their jaw-dropping physique. Or you see a fresh-faced runner swearing you can run a marathon without any training — just like they did. Whether or not you’re actively searching for wellness advice, it’s nearly impossible to avoid hearing about the latest health craze making bold guarantees of transformation. As you wonder if these claims hold any truth, you might also question why people often feel motivated to dive into intense challenges — when seemingly simple habits, such as getting enough sleep or eating more vegetables, often feel much harder to tackle. Many of us are drawn to these extreme challenges because we’re craving radical change, hoping it will help prove something to ourselves or to others, experts say. “We always see these kinds of challenges as opportunities for growth, particularly if we’re in a phase of our life where we’ve let ourselves go,” said Dr. Thomas Curran, associate professor of psychology at the London School of Economics and Political Science and an expert on perfectionism. “Maybe we feel that we need to be healthier, or we just had a breakup or (major) life event.” With social media amplifying these movements, it’s easy to see why people are increasingly drawn to the idea of achieving the “perfect” version of themselves. But before jumping into a new wellness challenge, it’s important to take a moment, reflect on your goals, and consider where you’re starting from. With health influencers raising the bar for success, the wellness space now often feels like a performative space where people strive to showcase peak physical and mental strength. While seeing others’ achievements can be motivating, it can also be discouraging if your progress doesn’t match theirs. Each person is chasing the perfect version of themselves — whether it’s a body or a lifestyle — which is dangerous because this is typically an impossible or dangerous version to achieve, Curran said. He added that this type of comparison creates a dangerous cycle in which people constantly feel dissatisfied with their own progress. “It’s a fantasy in many ways, and once you start chasing after it, you constantly find yourself embroiled in a sense of doubt and deficit,” he said. Curran also noted that wellness challenges can be particularly damaging for women who struggle with perfectionism, as they tend to be bombarded with impossible beauty standards and societal expectations. Renee McGregor, a UK-based dietitian who specializes in eating disorders and athlete performance, encourages people to approach wellness trends with curiosity and skepticism. That’s because some influencers and celebrities could be promoting products because there’s a financial benefit for them. “The thing to ask yourself about the person you’re taking advice from is what do they gain from it?” McGregor said. “If they are going to gain financially, then you know that they (could be willing) to sell you a lie.” Whether you want to try a new challenge or product that promises amazing results, McGregor suggests doing your research and seeking diverse perspectives, including consulting with doctors when possible. If you’re the type of person who thrives on challenges and pushing your limits, this doesn’t mean you need to shy away from wellness challenges altogether. But before diving in, take a step back and ask yourself if you’re pursuing the challenge for the right reasons, McGregor said. Some people want to try these challenges because they believe something is missing from their life, and they’re looking to attain “worth” or receive validation, McGregor noted. A good way to assess your motivation is by considering whether the challenge will benefit your health or if it’s about showcasing your accomplishments on social media or some other reason. Before trying any new trend, make sure you have the foundation to handle it and be aware of any potential risks, McGregor said. , this might mean signing up for a 5K but building your endurance gradually while incorporating other strength training exercises into your routine. For more intense challenges, such as a marathon, McGregor encourages people to consult with professionals or a coach who can monitor your progress and condition along the way. Both McGregor and Curran emphasize the importance of fostering sustainable health habits before embarking on more extreme challenges. Rather than chasing the idea of being “healthy,” McGregor suggests focusing on actual healthful behaviors and starting small. If you’re a highly sedentary person and want to add more movement to your day, try doing lunges while brushing your teeth or throughout your typical routine. McGregor suggests other small changes, too, including eating vegetables several times a day, basing meals around whole grains and having a handful of nuts each day. “These are little changes that allow people to reap the rewards of brain health and physical health instead of drinking five juices a day, which is never going to be the answer to your overall health,” she said. Most importantly, wellness should be giving people pleasure, not about reaching a certain number on the scale or looking a certain way to achieve ultimate happiness, McGregor said. “There’s a lot we can do with our psychological health, and I think (we) need to realize that comparison never really benefits (us),” McGregor said. “I think sometimes it’s really important for us to be in the (moment) and rest with what’s going on.”",

    "content": "As people get older, stiffness and reduced mobility can feel inevitable, leading to the common belief that maintaining flexibility requires long, tedious stretching routines. But that’s not the case. You don’t need to spend hours to move well as you age — you just need to move smarter. By incorporating simple, intentional movement habits into your daily life, you can improve and maintain your mobility over time, keeping your body functional and resilient as you grow older. While aging brings natural changes to your body, such as , joint stiffness and slower recovery, losing mobility doesn’t have to be one of them. Aging itself doesn’t automatically limit your mobility — lack of movement does. Many people become more sedentary as they get older, exacerbating age-related muscle loss and joint stiffness. When you stop moving through a full range of motion regularly, your body adapts by reducing that range. This is true at any age, but it becomes even more impactful as you mature. The good news? Mobility loss isn’t inevitable. Simple, strategic habits can keep you moving well for life. Think about how you move throughout the day: reaching for objects, pulling open doors, squatting to tie your shoes, rotating to grab a seat belt, and stabilizing your core to sit and stand upright. These natural movements occur in multiple directions and planes of motion, yet many people fail to train them regularly. Just like everyday movement patterns, exercises should be performed in all three planes of motion: sagittal (forward and backward), frontal (side to side) and transverse (rotational). Training movement in all the ways your body is designed to move helps you stay functional and mobile while also working to prevent pain and injury as you age. Mobility isn’t just about workouts — it’s about how you move all day long. If you spend most of your time sitting, your body adapts to that position, leading to and weaker postural muscles. Instead of relying on lengthy , incorporate small movement breaks into your day by getting up and . Even if you don’t have a lot of room to move, it helps to change positions frequently and try to reach, twist and bend in natural ways. One way to make regular daily movement into a habit is through “ ,” in which you pair an exercise with something you already do. For example, every time you get up from a chair, you could do five air squats or four . Starting your day with just five minutes of movement can have a significant impact on how you feel and move throughout the day. And a short mobility routine, such as , or targeted stretches , done consistently will make a big difference in your ability to move well over time. Daily mobility work isn’t just about staying flexible — it’s also an opportunity to check in with your body. Moving through a regular routine allows you to identify areas of tightness or discomfort before they become bigger issues. If you experience pain or limited movement that doesn’t improve, consult your doctor, physical therapist or movement specialist to address potential underlying concerns. Strength training is an important component for maintaining movement quality as you age. Strength exercises support mobility by keeping joints stable and preserving muscle mass to prevent stiffness-related weakness and improve recovery capacity. Strength training can be done , machines or simply the . Even two short per week can prove beneficial, especially when focusing on compound movements — exercises that engage multiple muscle groups and joints at once. These movements mimic real-life actions, making them more functional than isolated exercises. To maximize mobility benefits, it’s also important to include compound movements that work across all three planes of motion. Examples include squats (sagittal plane), (frontal plane) and standing torso twists (transverse plane). Prioritizing compound movements in all planes of motion ensures that your strength training enhances mobility rather than making you feel stiff or restricted. Your and feel in your body. Shallow chest breathing creates excess tension in the neck, shoulders and rib cage that limits movement and often results in chronic pain. Several times a day, try to focus on in which inhales expand the lower ribs more than the upper chest. And be sure to practice extended exhales, as instructed below, completely emptying your lungs to help reduce upper-body tension to improve mobility and engage and align your core for increased stability. Try this simple breathing exercise: •     Sit with your feet on the floor. •     Place your hands on your lower ribs. •     As you inhale deep into your lungs, you should feel the expansion of your lower ribs under your hands. •     As you exhale fully, your hands will ride your ribs back to their starting position. •     If you can, try to extend your exhale to double the count of your inhale. For instance, if you inhale for a count of four, try to exhale for a count of eight. •     Take five or more breaths in this pattern at least once a day — more, if possible. By , you improve your posture, relieve chronic tension and free up functional movement in your spine and shoulders. Remember, losing mobility as you age isn’t a given. By making movement a daily habit and incorporating strength training, you can maintain flexibility, stability and ease of movement without spending hours stretching.",

    "content": ". When people are young, if they are fortunate enough to enjoy good health, they get to move their bodies — running, jumping, bending, dancing, twisting — in pursuit of whatever activity they are engaged in. But if they are lucky enough to get older, life intervenes: Free time becomes more limited, and interests, responsibilities, habits and behavior all change. Many people abandon the playground and learn to sit — in a classroom, at the office, in front of the TV, in a car. Then at some point, many notice they have grown stiffer, and maybe it hurts to do this movement or that one, or they can no longer move in all the ways they want to. And people often attribute the aches and pains to simply getting older — but is the change inevitable? “The one thing that doesn’t have to change over the whole lifespan is your range of motion,” Dr. Kelly Starrett, a physical therapist and former professional athlete, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life. Quantifying mobility has been, excuse the pun, a moving target. “Every physician on the planet, every physical therapist, every chiropractic physician, all agree about what the body should be able to do. We’ve said, here’s what blood pressure is, and everyone knows that. Here’s what (body) temperature is, and everyone knows that. We started to become very sophisticated about understanding some aspects of our physiology, but not range of motion,” Starrett said. “What ended up happening is we created this definition of (mobility): Do you have access to your native range of motion? Can you control it? And, when we improve those things, did what matters to you improve?” he asked. Starrett’s most recent book, coauthored with his wife, Juliet Starrett, is It addresses mobility: measuring it (with 10 tests) and, equally important, regaining it in small increments that don’t take up all your time. “How do we simplify the process so it doesn’t feel so overwhelming?” he asked. “I’m not giving a busy working mother another listicle.” Why should you care about range of motion and mobility when the couch is so comfy and many of your needs and wants are only a mouse click away? Because mobility is associated with longevity, Starrett said. He noted that falling is a big predictor of in people age 65 and older. “If I don’t have access to balance or range of motion, I can’t solve as many movement problems. And losing your balance is a movement problem,” he said. “Getting up and down and being independent is a movement problem. Being able to rise from a chair while you’re holding your baby or your cat, or holding a cup of coffee and a book is just a movement problem.” As you get older, your body is more likely to “throw an error,” Starrett said. It’s a matter of use it or lose it. “If I want to have a joint and tendons that act like joints and tendons my whole life, I better use that joint and I better load those tendons,” he said. “Otherwise, they’re not going to be available to me as readily.” Muscles and tissues are like obedient dogs, he said. “They always adapt. At no age do you stop healing. At no age do you lose the ability to reclaim range of motion. It’s going to be a little slower than when you were 15 — that’s true. But the bottom line is your body is always going to adapt.” What can you do to easily retain or regain some of your mobility? Starrett has five tips. People mostly move from lying down to sitting in a chair to walking around a bit, Starrett noted. “Modern environments don’t really ask much of the movement language of our bodies. Most people are only using a few words that their bodies could write,” he said. “The first thing we should be thinking about is, ‘Well, how do I increase my exposure to more movement language?’” he said. “One of the easiest ways, for example, that we think would foundationally change society is if people sat on the ground in the evening, for 20 or 30 minutes while they were watching TV, while they’re reading a book,” he said. “And that could be leaning up against the couch; it doesn’t have to be in a strict lotus.” Getting into and out of that cross-legged position will also expose you to different movements, especially in the hips and knees. The practice can also tell you a bit about your ability to move freely and effortlessly. “Being able to get up and down from a cross-legged position is an excellent predictor of all-cause morbidity and all-cause mortality because … it says a lot about how you are interacting and adapting to your environment,” he said. And if you need to fidget, fidget — because that will also get your body into additional interesting positions, he said, such as kneeling or squatting. For more ideas on getting your body into different shapes, you can watch short instructional videos on Starrett’s YouTube channel. If you’re experiencing aches and pains in your shoulders, neck or back, Starrett has a fix. “I want you to hang for three minutes a day,” he said. You can hang in many different ways, he said — by grabbing the edge of a sink or a doorframe or, better yet, a pull-up bar — just get your arms above your head and stretch a bit. Even the yoga pose “downward-facing dog” counts as hang time, he added. “That would fundamentally change your posture, change your neck pain, change your breath, change your shoulders, make it so you’re more durable. I mean, that is a foundational posture,” he said. “Go to the airport and watch people in the (body) scanner,” he said. “You’ll see why we have that as a test (in the book), because people literally … cannot put their arms over their head anymore.” To keep stiffness at bay and maintain your mobility, Starrett advises everyone to do plenty of walking every day. “If I could give everyone in my family a pill that reduced all-cause mortality and morbidity by 51% — that’s walking 8,000 steps a day,” he said. “If you want your bones and tendons and ligaments and perceptive systems to work, you have to physically load them,” he said. “Right now, we’re seeing an epidemic of osteoporosis, osteopenia, sarcopenia — people are losing muscle, losing bone. That’s because this body is an adaptation machine, and if you stress it, it adapts, and if you don’t stress it, it adapts (in an undesirable way).” Walking loads our bones, our connective tissue, our tendons and our musculature. Additionally, walking helps the body decongest and clear waste, Starrett said. “Your body makes about 3 to 4 liters of lymphatic fluid every day,” he explained. “And the lymph system is the sewage system of the body: all of the broken-down cellular material, all of the waste, all the proteins that are too big to come in through your capillaries, all go out through your lymphatic system. “What we need to do is appreciate that that sewage system of the body has been bootstrapped through our muscle system,” he said. “And so, if we want to decongest, move the waste along, then we have to keep moving.” It also happens that as congested tissues get stiff, they don’t heal as well, he said. By decongesting our tissues, we get improved blood flow, which is also good for the brain. Exercise doesn’t need to be all work. “We started to treat the health of the body as like some onerous task,” said Starrett, noting that play has been lost in our modern lives. “When’s the last time you did a sport or jumped into a dance class? “One of my favorite tools that I use even for my elite athletes (are videos by) Caleb Marshall, who is ,” he said. “We use (his free three-minute dance routines) to warm up, to have fun, to laugh. And what it does is it gets me moving in a novel way. It gets me interacting with my friends. It’s super fun.” Starrett also carries around a flying disc in his backpack so wherever he and his wife go, they can have spontaneous play during a moment of free time. “Play could be a continuum,” he said. “Going for a walk with your friends in the evening — I’m going to call it play. Exploring your neighborhood on a hike could be play. Humans are best when we’re playing. And that will solve a lot of movement problems.” For robust physical movement, Starrett advised a balanced diet with enough protein and fruits and vegetables. Starrett recommended aiming for a day. “That could be frozen, that could be fresh, that could be beans, that could be potatoes, that could be fruits and vegetables — not just kale,” he said. “It’s about fiber and micronutrients. I need you to have all the vitamins and minerals on board so that you can have healthy tissues.” And he recommends at minimum getting 0.7 to 0.8 grams of protein per pound of body weight. “It’s about, ‘Hey, I want to have enough protein on board to be able to build muscle and build bone.’” “You’ve got to sleep,” Starrett said. “There’s not a single study in the world that says you can get by with less than seven hours of sleep. So, we look at seven as our sort of minimum threshold.” “When I work with people who are in chronic pain, who want to change their body composition, learn a skill, heal an injury, we start with their sleep,” he said. .

    "content": "When Nike unveiled its now-famous slogan “Just do it” in 1988, the US-based sportswear company to worldwide fame. Ordinary people also began invoking the catchphrase to motivate themselves to tackle daunting tasks, such as sticking to an exercise routine. That’s no surprise to researchers, who have found motivational quotes, mantras and positive self-talk help people in myriad ways. College students who listened to the mantra of their choice were more cheerful and had more clarity of mind afterward, according to a 2018 pilot study in the , while self-talk strategies facilitated learning and enhanced sports performance, a meta-analysis published in the journal found. Researchers also uncovered a positive connection between human health and mantra meditation — the practice of focusing your mind by repeatedly chanting a mantra — in a 2022 review published in the . The use of mantra meditation for stress relief and coping with high blood pressure was especially promising. With mantras and mottos so helpful, many fitness coaches incorporate them when working with their clients. “I find them extremely useful,” said Alysha Flynn, a women’s running coach and founder of the training program What Runs You based in York, Pennsylvania. “They help people refocus their mind and develop a sustainable habit that keeps them moving and healthy for a long time.” Motivation can be fleeting, agreed Kaya Luciani, a coach with the virtual training app Future based in Raleigh, North Carolina. “A more reliable source of drive comes from our mindset,” Luciani said. “While mottos are bite-sized, they are also a really powerful way to hone and train our mindset. They get people thinking, ‘Maybe it is as easy as just doing it.’” While mantras such as “Just do it” and “Yes, you can!” are popular, they don’t work for everyone. Each person has to find the particular phrase or sentence that speaks to them. Choosing something that’s short and easy to remember is best, said Flynn, who doesn’t recommend finding a mantra through research. “I usually encourage clients to let the words just find them,” Flynn said. “That’s what will make the mantra resonate more deeply.” Mantras and mottos are definitely personal, Luciani agreed. “I don’t suggest a specific phrase or quote to a client,” she said. “They often develop naturally and always end up being something that just clicks with a client in some way.” While not everyone will be helped by adopting a fitness motto, the two coaches have noticed some commonalities when using them with their clients. Younger women often adopt phrases such as “I can do hard things,” because they want to prove something to themselves, Flynn said. “But for women who are 35 or 45, their mantras are more about grace and understanding and honoring themselves.” Luciani, who coaches both men and women, doesn’t see huge differences in the mottos selected by each sex. Instead, she finds the mantras people adopt are more associated with their personality type and lifestyle. “Phrases that are more cut-and-dried like ‘Just do it’ or ‘Suck it up!’ align more with masculine energy, for example, whether that energy is in a man or woman,” Luciani said. Both women said they use mantras and mottos as one piece of their coaching, and more as a supplemental tool that glues together a client’s exercise program. More importantly, the coaches said, individuals need to assess where they are at in their fitness journey, along with the aspirations they have set for themselves. “When it comes to developing fitness goals and setting a pace for yourself, it’s very important that you don’t get the temptation to dive in headfirst all at once,” Luciani said. “That heightens your risk of stumbling into an all-or-nothing mentality, which is very common when folks are developing a new pattern.” For seasoned exercisers, it’s important to push yourself a little outside your comfort zone, Luciani said. If you don’t, you’ll risk becoming bored or disengaged, she said. “Ensuring you’re challenging yourself in an engaging way is just as important as not going overboard,” Luciani said. You should also ponder the thoughts or processes that might have been ingrained into you since you were a child, whether that’s a rigid training protocol or believing you’re a failure if you haven’t achieved a set goal. “It helps if you develop a mindset that’s more adaptable and flexible,” Flynn said. “Training is not a linear process.” Both Luciani and Flynn have used fitness mantras themselves, and they change over time. Luciani said she recently wrote on a sticky note, “You can do this.” “There’s not much to it,” Luciani said. “But having those words in front of your face every day can be something you really need one day and then a little whisper in your ear another. Your needs can ebb and flow.” One motto that currently resonates with Flynn is “Because you can.” “I have a deep understanding that, at some point in time, I won’t have the same fitness opportunities because my body won’t be physically capable of doing an activity,” Flynn said. “So I use it to squeeze out another drop now, while I’m able to do so.” Overall, the essence of using a motto to improve your fitness is understanding that your internal dialogue can be a powerful asset in changing your behavior. “We all can use words to train our minds, just as we train our body,” Luciani said.",

    "content": "You may be able to lower your risk for developing by speeding up your walking pace. That’s according to a published Tuesday in the journal Heart, which found average or were associated with 35% and 43% lower risks of all heart rhythm abnormalities studied, respectively, compared with a slow pace. Those abnormalities are the arrhythmias: atrial fibrillation, bradyarrhythmias and ventricular arrhythmias. Atrial fibrillation, or A-fib, is the , characterized by an irregular and rapid heartbeat beginning in the upper chambers, or atria, of the heart. Bradyarrhythmias heart rates of typically below 60 beats per minute, compared with the normal range of 60 to 100 beats per minute. when the lower chambers of the heart, or ventricles, beat too fast. “The great thing about walking is that it is accessible to everyone,” said senior study author Dr. Jill Pell, the Henry Mechan Professor of Public Health at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, via email. “You don’t need to spend money going to a gym or buying equipment. You can just walk out of your front door and keep going.” Nearly 60 million people worldwide have atrial fibrillation, according . Estimates of people with other arrhythmias are less conclusive, but in general, people with arrhythmias are at higher risk of having heart attacks or strokes and dying early, Pell said. “There are medicines and procedures that can be offered to these people but it would be preferable to prevent heart rhythm abnormalities from occurring in the first place,” Pell added. Additionally, to the authors’ knowledge, there has been only one previous study on walking pace and heart rhythm abnormalities, and it focused on just one type of arrhythmia, Pell said. And past research has indicated that “walking pace is linked to other outcomes such as cardiovascular disease, so we wanted to see if the same was true of heart rhythm abnormalities,” Pell said. The authors studied health and activity data from adults who had been recruited between 2006 and 2010 for the , which has followed the health outcomes of more than 500,000 people between the ages 40 and 69 in the United Kingdom. Participants answered questionnaires that asked whether their walking pace was slow (less than 3 miles or 4.8 kilometers per hour), average (3 to 4 miles or 4.8 to 6.4 kilometers per hour) or brisk (more than 4 miles or 6.4 kilometers per hour). During a follow-up period of 13 years on average, 9% of participants developed arrhythmias. “We had data on self-reported walking pace from more than 420,000 people but we also had accelerometry data on (nearly) 82,000 of these,” Pell said, referring to data from watches that track movement speed. “The data from the watches showed that walking at an average pace (3-4 miles per hour) for only 5-15 minutes per day was sufficient to reduce your risk.” The associations were strongest among people under 60, people without obesity, those with high blood pressure or two or more preexisting conditions, and women, the authors found. “This is an interesting finding because, although women are less likely to get atrial fibrillation than men, when they do get it they are at a higher risk of going on to get heart attacks and strokes than men with atrial fibrillation,” Pell said. Cardiologist Dr. Martha Gulati found the study important and said it confirms earlier related research — by herself and others — that showed benefits of physical activity for atrial fibrillation and stronger associations among women. “This shows that one of the primary prevention strategies to reduce cardiac arrhythmias is brisk walking,” added Gulati, director of preventive cardiology at the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Gulati wasn’t involved in the research. Since the study is observational, it doesn’t prove a cause and effect, the authors said. Self-reported health data is also vulnerable to inaccurate recollections or biases. In observational studies, there’s always a risk that people who walk slower do so because they already have disease, Pell said. “We did everything possible to avoid this by making sure that no one had any type of heart or vascular disease at the beginning of the study,” she added. “However, we really need an intervention study now to confirm our findings: a study of people who walk slowly in which some are asked to increase their walking pace and some are not,” Pell said. A-Fib is associated with multiple risk factors that are also linked with conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, said Dr. Sean Heffron, director of cardiovascular fitness and nutrition at the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at New York University. He was not involved in the study. Participants who walked faster were more likely to be men, live in less deprived areas, have healthier lifestyles and weigh less. They also had better grip strength, smaller waists and lower levels of inflammation and metabolic risk factors such as high cholesterol or blood sugar. “And bradyarrhythmias or ventricular arrhythmias are nonspecific and can have lots of other causes and certainly are far less clearly associated with lifestyle-type factors than is atrial fibrillation,” Heffron added. “I feel like lumping them all together was interesting.” The authors found that over one-third of the beneficial effect of a faster pace “was due to the fact that walking faster reduces cholesterol, glucose and blood pressure and makes you less likely to put on weight,” Pell said, noting that those reductions lower your risk of heart rate abnormalities. Though a brisk pace seems to be better than a slow pace, “the first step is literally a step,” Gulati said. “Walking slow is how we start, but the more you do it, the faster your pace will become.”",

    "content": "If you’ve been hitting the gym regularly and feeling stronger — but also stiffer and more slouched — you may be overlooking key elements that create balance in your workouts. Despite good intentions, many people unknowingly reinforce poor posture with their strength-training workouts, leading to tight muscles, restricted mobility and even chronic pain. A few simple adjustments can help you train smarter so that your workouts boost your strength while improving your posture, leaving you moving better in and out of the gym. Your reflects how your body balances and supports itself during movement. Ideally, that balance includes a fluid alignment of your head, shoulders, spine and pelvis. Having poor posture — with slumped shoulders, a rounded back and a forward head position — stems from muscular imbalances, in which some muscles are overworked and tight while others are underused and weak. Unfortunately, many common practices in can reinforce these imbalances. Consider a training plan heavy on bench presses, push-ups and crunches. These moves all strengthen muscles on the front of your body, including the chest, abs and hip flexors, without addressing muscles on the back of your body that help support upright posture, such as the mid back, glutes and hamstrings. Over time, this imbalance can pull your body forward into a rounded, collapsed position. Even when your workouts are balanced, lifting with poor form, such as letting your shoulders hunch during rows or squats, can ingrain postural dysfunction. This issue becomes especially true when you perform the exercises repeatedly under load. The good news is you don’t have to give up your favorite exercises. Try making these three strategic adjustments to keep building strength in a way that also improves your posture and mobility. One of the simplest and most effective ways to support good posture through strength training is by creating balance in your workouts. For every pushing movement, such as push-ups or overhead presses, include a pulling movement such as rows or band pull-aparts. Pulling movements activate the muscles in your upper and middle back that help counteract the forward-pulling effect of dominant front-body muscles. If, like most people, the movements of your daily life include a lot of reaching, pushing and sitting, ideally, you should include more pulling than pushing exercises in your workouts. You also should balance lower body training to ensure that you are strengthening both the fronts and backs of your legs. Squats and lunges are great for your quads (upper front-leg muscles) and your glutes, but it’s also important to incorporate hinging movements, such as dead lifts and hip thrusts, which emphasize hamstring (upper back-leg muscles) strength. Mobility work is not just for warm-ups or recovery days — it’s a critical part of training to maintain healthy posture and keep you moving well. Tight muscles from strength training can limit your range of motion. Without mobility work, you may start compensating in ways that increase joint stress and postural strain. Add mobility drills that target commonly restricted areas, primarily , hips and . Even just or other intentional mobility work before or after your workout can reduce stiffness and enhance movement patterns. Three of my go-to mobility exercises to include in strength-training programs are: • to activate postural muscles in your mid back and counteract overactive muscles in your neck and chest. • to mobilize your hips and reduce lower back tension. • to promote thoracic and shoulder mobility while opening your chest, releasing low-back tension and stretching the backs of your legs. Form matters, especially when it comes to posture. Practicing proper alignment during workouts reinforces good movement patterns that carry over into daily life. That means paying attention to: • Head and neck position: Avoid jutting your chin forward or tensing your neck. • Shoulder positioning: Keep your shoulders down and back, not shrugged up toward your ears. • Spinal alignment: Maintain a neutral spine, avoiding excessive arching or rounding. • : Exhale during the effort phase of exercises (e.g., the pushing-up phase of a push-up) to support core engagement and help maintain stable posture. If you’re unsure about your form, consider or filming yourself to check alignment during exercises. Try not to rely solely on mirrors, which, as you crane your neck to see yourself, can sometimes encourage unnatural head positions that throw off your posture. Making these small changes to your workouts will deliver big benefits. By training smarter, you can more effectively build strength that supports good posture and healthy, pain-free movement.",

    "content": "If your knees hurt, your first instinct is probably to blame them. But in many cases, knee pain isn’t about the knees at all — it’s about what’s happening above them. Tight hips, especially when combined with weakness or poor control, can alter how your legs move, forcing your knees to compensate in ways they’re not designed to. Over time, this added stress leads to chronic discomfort and, in some cases, serious injury. Understanding the hip-knee connection is the first step toward relieving that pain and moving better. The hip is a ball-and-socket joint, built for mobility in multiple directions. The knee, on the other hand, is a hinge joint that primarily moves forward and back. When your hips don’t move as they should — whether due to stiffness, weakness or a lack of pelvic control — your knees pick up the slack during activities such as walking, running, squatting or climbing stairs. For example, when the muscles on the outside of your hips aren’t keeping your hips aligned and providing lateral stability, your femur (thigh bone) can collapse inward, placing extra stress on the inside of your knee. When your pelvis isn’t moving properly because it’s restricted or imbalanced, it affects how your thigh bone aligns with your shin. That type of pelvic problem causes the kneecap to shift off-center as it moves, rubbing against the cartilage beneath it. The altered alignment resulting from these two issues causes significant stress and uneven wear and tear on the joint, contributing to conditions such as patellofemoral pain syndrome (pain around or under the kneecap  ), also known as runner’s knee, and cartilage breakdown that can lead to osteoarthritis and other debilitating issues. If you spend most of your day sitting, your hip flexors are likely tight, and your glutes may be underactive and weak. That imbalance can create a domino effect, leading to limited hip extension, poor pelvic alignment and less stability throughout your lower body. Even athletes aren’t immune. Repetitive motions such as running, cycling or weight lifting without can reinforce asymmetries or restrictions in hip movement. And when your training lacks adequate attention to hip rotation, lateral movement or glute strength, your knees are the ones that suffer. If you experience any of the following issues, your hips may be part of the problem: Knee pain after sitting or going up stairs: Both situations involve restricted hip movement, forcing your knees to overcompensate. Tightness or pulling in the front of your hips or groin: These signs indicate hip flexor restriction, which limits hip extension and shifts stress to your knees. Knee pain during hip stretches like pigeon pose: This issue suggests poor joint mechanics or mobility imbalances that transfer strain to the knee. Poor balance or difficulty with single-leg movements: These challenges can stem from weak or unstable hip stabilizers that affect alignment and joint control. Knees caving inward when you squat or lunge: A classic sign that your hips — particularly the glutes and deep rotators — aren’t stabilizing properly. A physical therapist or orthopedic specialist can help you assess your movement patterns more thoroughly, but the following exercises offer a great starting point for addressing hip-related knee pain. Here are five targeted strategies you can take as part of your workouts and self-care to restore hip mobility and support better knee mechanics. Tight hip flexors limit your ability to extend your hips, which pulls your pelvis forward and increases strain on your knees. Releasing these muscles in multiple planes improves overall hip mobility, which is why my go-to exercise is the . Weak adductors (inner thigh muscles) and glutes can lead to poor alignment of your femur and knee joint. Regularly practicing exercises that strengthen both sets of muscles can correct alignment and reduce lateral knee strain. Try this variation of the glute bridge: Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat. Place a yoga block or rolled towel between your knees. Ensure that your feet are pointed forward and aligned with your hips. Exhale fully as you tuck your tailbone under and lift your hips a few inches. Avoid lifting too high and arching your back. Hold the lifted position for a few seconds, squeezing the block or towel strongly to engage your inner thighs and glutes, then lower slowly. Inhale when you reach the floor. Repeat 10 to 12 times for two to three sets. Most people train in the sagittal plane (forward and back) but neglect lateral movement (side to side), which is a key to functional hip mobility. Because your knees are hinge joints not designed to handle lateral forces, it’s important to build strength and control in side-to-side movement through exercises such as lateral lunges. How to do a : Inhale as you step to the side with your right foot, pushing your hips back and bending your right knee while keeping your left leg straight. Keep your chest lifted and your core engaged. Exhale as you push off the right foot to return to standing. Perform two to three sets of 8 to 10 reps per side. or using a massage gun can improve tissue quality and prepare muscles for stretching and mobility work. When hip muscles are extremely tight, jumping straight into mobility work can make it less effective and even aggravate the knees. Spend 30 to 60 seconds rolling or massaging each region in and around the hips — glutes, outer thighs, inner thighs, quads (front, top of leg) and hamstrings (back, top of leg) — before stretching or mobility exercises. Extreme stretches like pigeon pose may feel good in the hips, but they often place excessive torque on the knees due to the angle and body weight pressing into the joint, especially when hip mobility is limited. Even if you feel flexible in a pose such as pigeon, it’s important to remember that the hip is a 360-degree joint. in one direction without addressing other ranges of motion can lead to imbalances. Instead, focus on safe, well-balanced stretches that support functional mobility without putting unnecessary stress on the knees. I recommend using gentle yet effective supported variations such as a (from a chair, place one ankle on top of the opposite knee) or or chair (rest one shin on the cushion with your other leg behind you in a kneeling lunge). These options allow you to target hip mobility while protecting your knees. : Remember, the knees may be where you feel the pain, but the hips are often where the problem starts. By improving your hip mobility, strength  and control, you give your knees the support they need to function as intended — pain-free and powerful.",

    "content": "We already know exercise is good for our bodies, but it’s also an essential tool for . Yet many people still separate physical fitness from mental wellness, viewing them as two different goals rather than parts of the same whole. Too often, workout routines are designed with only the body in mind, focusing on burning calories, building strength or improving flexibility. What’s often missing is intentionality — movement designed not just to make you sweat but also to help you feel better mentally and emotionally. shows that consistent physical activity can ease symptoms of anxiety and depression, sharpen executive functioning and improve sleep quality, a key factor in and . But not all movement is created equal when it comes to mental health. The type of movement — and how you approach it — matters. As a mind-body coach in professional sports for more than two decades, I have helped elite athletes build durable, mobile bodies while also supporting their mental resilience — using movement and breath to regulate the nervous system, stay grounded under pressure and maintain sharp focus. These same tools and principles can help anyone strengthen body and mind, improving how they move and feel every day. Pushing yourself through a high-intensity workout while mentally checked out or disconnected from your body doesn’t offer the same mental health benefits as moving with awareness. True mind-body fitness involves being present during movement, using intentional breathing and training in ways that support your nervous system. The brain and body are deeply interconnected through the nervous system. One of the key players in this connection is the , which runs from your brain stem to your gut and influences functions as varied as heart rate, digestion, mood and emotional regulation. When you with — you stimulate the vagus nerve, which activates your (your “rest and recover” state). Doing so can calm your mind, lower stress and improve focus by shifting your body out of “fight-or-flight” mode, helping you achieve restful states more easily. On the other hand, when exercise is overly intense or performed with poor breathing patterns and no recovery, it can spike stress hormones and leave you feeling more depleted than energized. That’s why it’s important to choose exercises and formats that align with your needs and goals — not just physically, but mentally and emotionally, too. You don’t need to overhaul your workout regimen to make it more mind-body focused. Start by layering in these five simple strategies. Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain. Breath is the most efficient and effective way to influence your nervous system. Use slow, intentional breathing before, during and after your workouts. •    In warm-ups: Use diaphragmatic breathing to downshift from your day and connect to your body. •    During mobility work: Use your breathing to move your rib cage in ways that support better posture, positioning and . For example, when twisting your upper body to the right, use inhalations to expand your ribs on the right side and exhale to contract your ribs on the left side, to facilitate the rotation. •    During strength training: Exhale through the effort phase — as you would when pushing up in a push-up or standing up from a squat — to activate core control and regulate tension. •    In cooldowns: Practice , which further stimulate the vagus nerve, to promote relaxation and recovery. I recommend doubling the length of your exhales during recovery sessions by practicing a four-count inhale with an eight-count exhale. improves flexibility and joint health, but its benefits go beyond the physical. Practicing breath-driven mobility drills, such as the three-way hip flexor release and to also sharpen body awareness and support nervous system regulation. Add exercises such as these to your warm-ups or active recovery days, focusing on coordinating breath and movement to build physical control and mental clarity. High-intensity workouts have benefits, but overdoing them can chronically elevate stress levels and impair recovery. To support your nervous system, balance your weekly training with lower-intensity sessions. Activities such as , , and help keep you active while promoting resilience, emotional regulation and injury prevention. No matter what type of training you’re doing — strength, mobility, cardio or recovery — your mental presence affects how your body performs and adapts. Rushing through reps or zoning out increases the risk of poor form, injury and missed benefits. Focus on the quality of your movement: Pay attention to alignment, control your pace and stay aware of how your body feels. When your mind starts to wander, use your breath to ground yourself in the present and reconnect with your body. Presence turns every exercise into an opportunity to build both physical skill and mental clarity. Before, during and after your workouts, take 30 seconds at a time to assess how you feel. Ask yourself: Where am I holding tension? How’s my breathing? What do I need right now — intensity or grounding? These moments of self-awareness turn your fitness practice into a tool for emotional regulation, not just physical conditioning. Here’s a sample weekly structure to balance strength, mobility and nervous system support: with breath-focused movement prep and mobility cooldown. Breath-driven mobility or Pilates and low-intensity cardio (walking, light cycling, etc.). A with and gentle stretching or yoga. Mixed training (circuit or flow-style) that blends mobility, strength and cardio. Although having a plan is important, mind-body fitness is about listening to how you feel and adjusting accordingly. Movement can shift your mental and emotional state, but it works best when you begin with awareness and choose what best meets your needs, whether that means calming down or boosting energy. The goal is to support — not override — your system. Remember, a mind-body fitness routine isn’t about doing less, it’s about doing what serves you more completely. By training with awareness, incorporating breath and mobility, and respecting the needs of your nervous system, you’ll not only feel stronger — you’ll feel more focused, resilient and grounded in everyday life.",

    "content": "With fitness culture too often celebrating extreme training and a “no days off” mentality, rest is routinely misunderstood or overlooked entirely. If you’re constantly sore, stiff or stuck at a plateau, it might be because you’re not resting enough. Much of the progress you make from training actually happens during rest. Recovery is when your body repairs tissues, replenishes energy stores and rebalances nervous system activity. Skipping that crucial process doesn’t make you tougher — it makes you more likely to burn out, get injured or stop seeing results. In my work with top professional athletes, I’ve spent the past two decades creating training and recovery programs, and one thing always holds true: The effort you put into recovery directly correlates with the effectiveness of your training. Proper rest drives progress. That lesson isn’t just for elite performers — it applies to anyone who wants to reap the health and wellness benefits of regular exercise. Rest isn’t just the absence of activity; it’s a crucial physiological process that facilitates muscle repair, nervous system recovery, immune function and hormonal balance. Engaging in or causes microtears in muscle fibers and places a demand on the systems of your body. With adequate recovery, your body responds to that stress by making positive adaptations, leading to strength gains, and an enhanced capacity to handle future physical demands. Neglecting sufficient recovery time can result in the accumulation of stressors, which hinders the body’s ability to rebuild and adapt. This cumulative stress can manifest as fatigue, persistent soreness, diminished performance, mood disturbances, disrupted sleep and a greater risk of overuse injury. Even one single night of sleep deprivation in healthy young adults elevates cortisol levels and reduces muscle protein synthesis, inhibiting tissue repair and delaying muscle growth, according to a study published in the journal . Prolonged elevation of cortisol and other stress hormones can also , and heighten vulnerability to illness. Without consistent recovery, your body lacks the opportunity to adapt, rebuild and thrive under the demands of training. Skipping rest doesn’t just stall progress — it can actively reverse progress and even cause damage. Just like your body, your mind requires rest to function at its best. Mental fatigue, like physical fatigue, builds up under stress. Without recovery, your brain struggles to , focus attention and motivate consistent effort, all of which impact your workouts and daily life. Prioritizing recovery from training sessions and ensuring proper sleep habits helps balance your nervous system, reduce stress hormones and restore emotional balance. shows that supports your mind-body connection by promoting cognitive function and emotional regulation that reinforce neural pathways involved in movement and learning. That’s why any good mind-body fitness program includes mental check-ins during training and emphasizes recovery. Intentional rest can boost mental motivation, increase performance and leave you feeling more mindfully grounded, supporting both your fitness goals and your overall well-being. Not all rest looks the same. The right kind of rest depends on how you feel, what you’ve been doing, and what your body and mind need most. means complete time off from training, avoiding exertion and limiting screen time while putting an emphasis on ways to relax. Think: a long soak in the tub, taking an afternoon nap or simply lounging on the couch with a good book. If you’re feeling worn down or sore, a full rest day can be exactly what your body needs. involves light, low-impact movement that encourages circulation without placing additional stress on the body. Activities like , gentle yoga, simple drills and fall into this category. targets your nervous system directly, using tools like , meditation or soft-tissue care, such as massage or assisted stretching, to shift you into a parasympathetic state. This type of recovery is especially valuable after intense training or during periods of high stress. Recovery doesn’t have to be complicated. You should always integrate recovery into your workouts by cooling down, resting between sets and using your breathing to down-regulate your nervous system after high-output sessions. But also build recovery into your weekly fitness programming as you would any other type of training. Here’s what a well-balanced week of fitness and recovery should look like: • of , or training • of active recovery, focusing on walking or light movement • of restorative recovery, incorporating and bodywork • a passive rest day of total relaxation You might feel like you’re doing everything right by training hard, eating well and staying active, but without rest and recovery, the math doesn’t add up. Rest days aren’t optional — they’re essential. Training breaks your body down, and recovery builds it back up. When you prioritize both, you’ll feel better, perform better and sustain your progress over time.",

    "content": "Val Kilmer, a movie star who throughout his career proved he was up for any task, from playing a cocky naval pilot to wearing the Batman suit, died on Tuesday, according to his daughter Mercedes Kilmer, who released a statement to the and the . He was 65. The cause of death was pneumonia, Mercedes Kilmer told the media outlets. CNN has reached out to representatives for Kilmer and his family for comment. Kilmer had recovered from a 2014 throat cancer diagnosis that required surgery that altered his voice. In recent years, Kilmer largely stepped away from acting, but made a brief return to the craft in “Top Gun: Maverick,” the sequel to the original film that launched him and that cast into superstardom. The sequel, which released in 2022 after a two-year delay, deftly blended Kilmer’s off-screen health issues into the film’s story, with his Tom “Iceman” Kazansky, the smug but cool rival to Tom Cruise’s Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, ultimately succumbing to an ailment in the film. As one of Kilmer’s last film roles, it concluded one of the most interesting — and bankable — careers in Hollywood history. Born and raised in California’s San Fernando Valley, Kilmer studied at the Hollywood Professional School before heading to New York where, at 21, he became the youngest student at the time to be accepted into Julliard School’s drama department. He began his film career in the 1984 comedy “Top Secret!” and acted in several movies throughout the ‘80s including his breakout role in 1986’s “Top Gun.” Then came an incredible streak of successful genre-spanning movies in the 1990s: A superhero film (with 1995’s “Batman Forever,” in which he played the Dark Knight), a Western (1993’s “Tombstone,” where he played Doc Holliday), a biopic (1991’s “The Doors,” in which he portrayed Jim Morrison) and a crime film (Michael Mann’s 1995 masterpiece “Heat”). One of his less lucrative pursuits included his one-man stage show “Citizen Twain,” about Mark Twain, whose work he deeply admired and referenced frequently in interviews. In all, Kilmer’s films made nearly $2 billion at the global box office, according to Comscore. Throughout his career, the roles that Kilmer played possessed an iconic quality while underscoring the way his career frequently zigged at the point where it could have zagged, to his detriment if not in terms of the quality of the work but how Hollywood and the public perceived him. Kilmer enthusiastically agreed to star as Batman, for example, but quickly soured on that experience, passing on another sequel in favor of the forgettable reboot “The Saint.” Similarly, he took a role in “The Island of Dr. Moreau” in order to play opposite Marlon Brando, only to clash with director John Frankenheimer (exchanges caught on camera) and be disappointed when a detached Brando periodically refused to come to the set, letting a stand-in take his place. He reflected on his career and life in through interactions he had videotaped with his family and on film sets for years, including behind-the-scenes footage from “Tombstone” and the “Top Gun” cast partying after hours (“We were all at the start of our careers,” Kilmer recalled). At the time, Kilmer was recovering from throat-cancer surgery, so his son, Jack, read the actor’s written narration — sounding uncannily like his father. Kilmer frequently expressed about his desire to work with certain directors, showing audition videos that he shot for parts he failed to land in “Goodfellas” and “Full Metal Jacket,” seeking to impress directors Martin Scorsese and Stanley Kubrick, respectively. He also documented his laborious auditioning and preparation process for portraying Jim Morrison in “The Doors.” Ultimately, in the documentary, he expressed excitement about all that would come next. “I have behaved bizarrely to some. I deny none of this and have no regrets because I have lost and found parts of myself that I never knew existed. I am blessed,” he said in the movie. Kilmer identified as a Christian Scientist, opening up in interviews about his faith and beliefs. In a 2020 interview with Men’s Health, the actor spoke about illness through the lens of his faith. “Well, something that was reaffirmed to me – on such a level, it was almost shocking – was a sense of universal love, a kind of power and a different sense of love. It was coming into my consciousness and my body while I was at the hospital,” he , going on to add that he didn’t “believe in death.” Kilmer is survived by his two adult children, Jack and Mercedes, from his marriage to “Willow” co-star Joanne Whalley. The younger Kilmers are both actors and have been involved in projects with their father. Kilmer co-starred with Mercedes in the 2020 film “Paydirt” and, in addition to voicing the “Val” documentary, Jack lent his voice to his father’s character on the . Despite his condition at the time of the 2021 documentary, and tragedies that included the death of his younger brother at age 15, Kilmer spoke of leading a “magical life.” He said that he found the silver lining even as he endured fans asking for the same “Top Gun”-inspired “You can be my wingman” autograph over and over at Comic-Con. “I feel grateful,” he said.",

    "publication_date": "2025-05-02T18:14:01.980Z",

    "content": "Ruth Buzzi, who rose to fame as the frumpy and bitter Gladys Ormphby on the groundbreaking sketch comedy series “Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In” and made over 200 television appearances during a 45-year career, has died at age 88. Buzzi died Thursday at her home in Texas, her agent Mike Eisenstadt said, according to the . She had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and was in hospice care. Shortly before her death, her husband Kent Perkins had posted a statement on Buzzi’s Facebook page, thanking her many fans and telling them: “She wants you to know she probably had more fun doing those shows than you had watching them.” Buzzi won a Golden Globe and was a two-time Emmy nominee for the NBC show “Laugh-In” that ran from 1968 to 1973. She was the only regular to appear in all six seasons, including the pilot. She was first spotted by “Laugh-In” creator and producer George Schlatter playing various characters on “The Steve Allen Comedy Hour.” Schlatter was holding auditions for “Laugh-In” when he received a picture in the mail of Buzzi in her Ormphby costume, sitting in a wire mesh trash barrel. The character was clad in drab brown with her bun covered by a hairnet knotted in the middle of her forehead. “I think I hired her because of my passion for Gladys Ormphby,” he wrote in his 2023 memoir, “Still Laughing A Life in Comedy.” “I must admit that the hairnet and the rolled-down stockings did light my fire. My favorite Gladys line was when she announced that the day of the office Christmas party, they sent her home early.” The Gladys character used her purse as a weapon against anyone who bothered her, striking people over the head. On “Laugh-In,” her most frequent target was Arte Johnson’s dirty old man character Tyrone F. Horneigh. “Gladys embodies the overlooked, the downtrodden, the taken for granted, the struggler,” Buzzi told The Connecticut Post in 2018. “So when she fights back, she speaks for everyone who’s been marginalized, reduced to a sex object or otherwise abused. And that’s almost everyone at some time or other.” Buzzi took her act to the Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts in Las Vegas, where she bashed her purse on the heads of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Lucille Ball, among others. “Ruth Buzzi brought a singular energy and charm to sketch comedy that made her a standout on ‘Laugh-In’ and the Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts. Her characters, especially the unforgettable Gladys Ormphby, captured the delightful absurdity of the era,” said Journey Gunderson, executive director of the National Comedy Center in Jamestown, New York. Buzzi’s other recurring characters on “Laugh-In” included Flicker Farkle; Busy-Buzzi, a Hollywood gossip columnist; Doris Swizzler, a cocktail-lounge regular who got drunk with husband Leonard, played by Dick Martin; and an inconsiderate flight attendant. “I never took my work for granted, nor assumed I deserved more of the credit or spotlight or more pay than anyone else,” Buzzi told The Connecticut Post. “I was just thrilled to drive down the hill to NBC every day as an employed actor with a job to do.” Buzzi remained friends through the years with “Laugh-In” costars Lily Tomlin and Jo Anne Worley. Born Ruth Ann Buzzi on July 24, 1936, in Westerly, Rhode Island, she was the daughter of Angelo Buzzi, a nationally known stone sculptor. Her father and later her brother operated Buzzi Memorials, a gravestone and monument maker in Stonington, Connecticut, where she was head cheerleader in high school. Buzzi enrolled at the Pasadena Playhouse at age 17. Two years later, she traveled with singer Rudy Vallee in a musical and comedy act during her summer break. That earned her an Actors’ Equity union card before she graduated from the playhouse’s College of Theatre Arts. Buzzi moved to New York and was immediately hired for a lead role in an off-Broadway musical revue, the first of 19 such shows she performed in on the East Coast. She got her national television break on “The Garry Moore Show” in 1964, just after was replaced by Dorothy Loudon on the series. Buzzi played Shakundala the Silent, a bumbling magician’s assistant to Dom DeLuise’s character Dominic the Great. Buzzi was a regular on the CBS variety show “The Entertainers,” whose hosts included Burnett and Bob Newhart. She was in the original Broadway cast of “Sweet Charity” with Gwen Verdon in 1966. Buzzi toured the country with her nightclub act, including appearances in Las Vegas. She was a semi-regular on “That Girl” as Marlo Thomas’ friend. She costarred with Jim Nabors as time-traveling androids on “The Lost Saucer” in the mid-1970s. Her other guest appearances included variety shows hosted by Burnett, Flip Wilson, Glen Campbell, Tony Orlando, Donny and Marie Osmond and Leslie Uggams. She appeared in Ball’s last comedy series, “Life With Lucy.” Buzzi guested in music videos with “Weird Al” Yankovic, the B-52’s and the Presidents of the United States of America. She did hundreds of guest voices in cartoon series including “Pound Puppies,” “Berenstain Bears,” “The Smurfs” and “The Angry Beavers.” She was Emmy nominated for her six-year run as shopkeeper Ruthie on “Sesame Street.” Her movie credits included “Freaky Friday,” “Chu Chu and the Philly Flash,” “The North Avenue Irregulars” and “The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again.” Buzzi was active on social media and had thousands of followers whom she rewarded with such one-liners as “I have never faked a sarcasm” and “Scientists say the universe is made up entirely of neurons, protons and electrons. They seem to have missed morons.” She married actor Perkins in 1978. The couple moved from California to Texas in 2003 and bought a 640-acre ranch near Stephenville. Buzzi retired from acting in 2021 and suffered a series of strokes the following year. Her husband told The Dallas Morning News in 2023 that she had dementia.",

    "content": "Jill Sobule, singer of 1995 hit tracks “I Kissed a Girl” and “Supermodel,” has died at the age of 66. Sobule died early Thursday morning in a house fire, according to a statement from her publicity firm. On Friday, CNN affiliate WCCO reported that firefighters were called early the previous morning to a residence in Woodbury, Minnesota, where they found a home fully engulfed in flames. One of the residents made it out but said another person was still inside. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. The Denver-born singer’s song “I Kissed a Girl,” off of her 1995 self-titled album, became the first openly LGBTQ-themed song to chart on the Billboard Top 20. She is perhaps best known for her single “Supermodel,” also off her self-titled album, which was her second. “Supermodel” was prominently featured in the popular 1995 movie “Clueless,” helping Sobule break through to the mainstream. John Porter, Jill’s manager, said in a statement that Sobule was “a force of nature and human rights advocate whose music is woven into our culture” and that he hopes her “music, memory, & legacy continue to live on and inspire others.” Sobule’s musical career spanned over three decades, starting in the 1990s with her debut album “Things Here are Different,” which was produced by rock legend and record producer Todd Rundgren. The record was known for its track “Too Cool to Fall in Love.” Her musical oeuvre includes 12 albums that take on issues including the death penalty, disordered eating and LGBTQ+ issues, among other topics. She performed with Neil Young, Cyndi Lauper and Tom Morello, among many others. Sobule released her seventh studio album “California Years” in 2009 and then went on an extended break from releasing music. In 2018, she released what is now her final album, “Nostalgia Kills.” “I was my own procrastinatrix, is what I call it,” she told Billboard in a 2018 about her long break between albums. “I started loving music again — loving listening, loving writing and the original spirit of why I did this in the first place, I suppose.” Sobule added that she loved to perform, “and I love telling the stories of the songs.” According to her website, Sobule was set to perform this weekend in Colorado, with further dates planned throughout the US into the summer and fall. Her PR firm’s statement said there will be a formal memorial celebrating the singer’s life and legacy later this year. Sobule is survived by her brother and sister-in-law, her nephews, cousins and friends. CNN’s Kara Devlin contributed to this report.",

As seen on Madonna’s , the “Vogue” singer went to watch John perform on “Saturday Night Live” this weekend, later sharing a photo posing with him as proof that the pair are now friends. “We Finally Buried the Hatchet!!!” Madonna wrote in the caption. “Over the decades it hurt me to know that someone I admired so much shared his dislike of me publicly as an artist. I didn’t understand it.” Madonna wrote that once she heard John was the “SNL” musical guest, she “decided to go.” “I needed to go backstage and confront him,” she wrote. “When I met him, the first thing out of his mouth was, “Forgive Me” and the wall between us fell down. Forgiveness is a powerful tool. Within minutes. We were hugging.” She added that John had written a song for her and wants to collaborate. The legendary pair’s so-called feud from a comment John made at the 2004 Q Awards while he accepted the award for classic songwriter, where he accused Madonna of lip-syncing. The superstars have since traded insults in public fashion. In 2012, Madonna , when she took home the gong for best original song for her track “Masterpiece” from her film “W.E.” over John’s “Hello Hello” from the animated movie “Gnomeo & Juliet.” Ahead of the show, John was on the red carpet and said that she didn’t “stand a f—ing chance” for the award, and while her Madgesty was later on stage delivering her acceptance speech, the camera cut away to John, whose look was pure daggers. Nowadays, it seems, the two have come together and made peace and instead of slamming John, Madonna is praising his legacy. “Seeing him perform when I was in high school changed the course of my life,” she wrote in her Instagram post on Monday. “I had always felt like an outsider growing up and watching him on stage helped me to understand that it was OK to be different.” Later on Monday, John commented on Madonna’s post thanking her for “forgiving me and my big mouth” and acknowledging the “groundbreaking work” she’s done as an artist, as well as nodding to her HIV/AIDS advocacy work since the 1980s. “I’m grateful we can move forward. I’m increasingly distressed by all the divisiveness in our world at the moment,” he wrote. “Both you and I have wholeheartedly been accepted and embraced by communities who are under threat around the world. By pulling together, I’m hopeful that we can make great things happen for those who really need support.”",

The AP reported that the board issued its recommendation unanimously after a hearing, where they heard from several witnesses advocating for the “Need a Favor” singer including Nashville Sheriff Daron Hall. Jelly Roll, whose name is Jason DeFord, wants to be able to perform internationally and continue to share about his reformation journey. He told the board that his criminal record makes it difficult for him to travel abroad to perform. “I want to be an inspiration for people who are now where I used to be — to let them know that change is truly possible,” Jelly Roll told the board, according to the AP. “One of the reasons I’m asking for your recommendation for this pardon is because I’m looking to take my message of redemption through the power of music and faith through the rest of the world.” The 40-year-old musician spent time behind bars at age 17 on a robbery charge and at age 23 on drug charges, according to the AP. In 2008, at age 23, he was sentenced to eight years of court-ordered supervision after finding marijuana and crack cocaine in his car. The singer has taken on an advocacy role to speak about his past and subsequent redemption since he first broke onto the music scene in 2022. Last year, he traveled to Washington DC to testify in a Senate hearing to lobby for stronger legislation against the ongoing fentanyl crisis in the US, saying during his “I believed when I sold drugs, genuinely, that selling drugs was a victimless crime.” The CMA Award went on to say, “I am here now standing as a man that wants to be a part of the solution.” Jelly Roll also visits jails, rehab centers and youth centers around the country before performing concerts, an effort that was recognized during the hearing on Tuesday.",

Officer David Cuellar later told CNN that the home’s owner “was at home at the time of the incident.” The DA’s office said on Wednesday that the crash caused “substantial damage” to the gate. Attorney information for Carwyle is not listed in Los Angeles County criminal court online records. CNN has reached out to Aniston’s representative for comment. “Stalking is a crime that can quickly escalate from harassment to dangerous, violent actions, threatening the safety of victims and our communities,” District Attorney Nathan Hochman said in a statement on Wednesday. “My office is committed to aggressively prosecuting those who stalk and terrorize others, ensuring they are held accountable.” CNN’s Josh Campbell and Cindy Von Quednow contributed to this report.",

Last year, Bolton in a statement posted to his official that a brain tumor had been discovered “which required immediate surgery” and that he’d be taking a break from touring. Bolton said at the time that the surgery was a success and that he was focused on recuperating at home. After completing radiation and chemotherapy treatment in October, Bolton now undergoes MRI scans every two months to monitor for any recurrence of the cancer, People reported on Tuesday. In April, his scan was clear. Bolton has the support of his three daughters and six grandchildren, who he told People he’s been spending time with at his home in Connecticut during his recovery. “Whenever you find yourself in any kind of challenging position, just to know that you’re not alone going through it is a big deal,” he said. Bolton is a legendary singer who found fame in the 1980s and ’90s with songs including a cover of Percy Sledge’s “When a Man Loves a Woman” and “How Am I Supposed to Live Without You?”",

They are not airy, fairy songs that you are wondering who they’re about, but you don’t really get it. They’re real stories of memories of mine of fantastic men,” she said. The “Landslide” songstress went onto tease the crowd with one of those stories, involving the late and great Prince, who she identified as a friend. Nicks recounted how she attended the premiere of the iconic film “ ” in the ’80s, and how she only watched the first half of the movie up until a moment when Prince’s character slapped Apollonia. Afterward, she explained that she went to the premiere’s afterparty across the street, where Prince asked her what she thought of the film. She sheepishly told him she only saw the first half, but as consolation, offered him the gift she had brought for him – a 24 karat necklace with gold hearts on it. Prince told her that he didn’t want the necklace, going on to say, “You always bring me a gift, you never bring me you.” Nicks said that that line was the launch point for her new record.

    "content": "Editor’s Note: After the surprising and of Season 3 of “The White Lotus” on Sunday, Aimee Lou Wood had some takeaways that underscore all the feels that viewers are sure to be having amongst themselves and over social media for some time. At a cast panel immediately following a screening of the finale, a stricken-looking Wood – who had just watched the episode in which her character Chelsea dies in the crossfire between her love Rick (Walton Goggins) and hotel security – remarked on how “there was a lot of hope in it” in spite of the tragic end to her storyline. “Do you know what I loved about that last episode?” Wood said. “There was a lot of hope in it. There was a lot of softness.” Wood added that that feeling came from “all the connections” that are made and ratified at the season’s conclusion, specifically the ones between the three girlfriends, as well as the Ratliff family. “I found it incredibly uncynical, especially for ‘The White Lotus,’” Wood remarked. “It was very, very, very moving.” And yet, of course, she also addressed the emotional weight of Chelsea’s tragic ending. “Obviously, being the one that dies, this whole time I’ve been like, ‘So sad, Mike (White) kills hope. Because , and he kills her.’” “And it’s like, yeah, but then what I saw just then was like, there was so much love in it!” she added. “That’s why it’s so much more painful, because you have to hold it all at the same time.” Wood concluded by saying that dichotomy “is life, isn’t it? Just love and pain all the time.” Goggins was not present at the panel, but he echoed his onscreen love interest’s feelings in a on Sunday night, timed close to the airing of “The White Lotus” finale. “Rick + Chelsea. With the heaviest of hearts… To me, ours was a love story,” he wrote alongside a beautiful carousel of pictures showing the pair on location in Thailand. “It was only ever a love story, hindered by unresolved, childhood trauma. We all have them… but can we move past them. In the depths of our despair there is always beauty around us.” Later in the post, Goggins thanked Wood “for being my partner… a journey I will never forget.”",

    "content": "Themes like job loss, death, aging, family dysfunction and generational divide may not sound like comedy material, but the Emmy-winning series “ ” manages to find the laughs around life’s roadblocks. Ahead of the Season 4 premiere next week, star – who plays feisty comedienne-turned-late night host Deborah Vance on the series – talked about how that dichotomy is drawn from real life at a recent press conference. “We’ve all had that in our own lives. You know, tragedy and comedy. I mean, that’s just what life is,” she shared, emphasizing the value of being able “to do that and to still have the tone of the show be essentially kind of fun and joyous.” “But then the reality of, there’s always the flip side of the coin,” she added. The cast and crew of “Hacks” were in production on Season 1 during the Covid pandemic, they navigated the in 2023, and faced the Los Angeles earlier this year. “I think we have been through a lot together,” the show’s co-creator and costar Paul W. Downs said, pointing out that “Hacks” is “a show that was made pre-vaccine.” “We started out wearing two masks and a shield, and being six feet away from each other. And I think it’s kind of like we’re forged in fire,” he continued. “And I feel like what we’ve experienced as a family, as ‘Hacks’ family, has just made us closer. It’s just made the work better.” “I think every film and television show, they say is a miracle, and it’s true,” Downs added. “It takes a huge community of people. But I think, weirdly, when you’re on a show or you’re on a set where you do have all of these hurdles, and you can see them tangibly, it just bonds you and brings you closer together.” Downs plays Deborah and Ava’s overwhelmed agent Jimmy in “Hacks.” Offscreen, he is married to series co-creator Lucia Aniello. (Jen Statsky is the third co-creator and writer on the series). “Comedy and tragedy exists sometimes simultaneously in life,” Downs said. “It weirdly has reflected, I think, the tone of the show, the things we’ve gone through because we’re making a comedy, but we’ve been through, you know, pandemics and fires and deaths and all kinds of things.” Wildfires are referenced in Season 4, which sees Deborah and company relocate from Las Vegas to Los Angeles in order for her to start hosting her late-night show. After an episode titled “I Love LA,” a title card appears in tribute to the filming location used for Deborah’s LA abode, a pink mansion built around 1930, according to Smart, that was destroyed in this year’s fires. “It’s been sitting there and hasn’t been touched by fire in 100 years almost. And it burned. And it was really sad,” Smart shared. “We had just, just finished shooting there, I think the week before or something? And to envision those beautiful rooms and that beautiful fountain and the back, the yard and the couple that lived there and their dog – I mean, they’re safe, thank God – but yeah, that was shocking.” Einbinder highlighted how these experiences have brought the show team closer, some of whom she said have known each other since high school. “We have a crew that is such a cohesive group. And every department is so close and there’s so much love,” she said. “We have, as a collective – beyond just us on the stage – we have as a collective come together and really gotten close in a way that I am told is not really the industry standard, frankly.” “Like we all really go through it side by side. It’s really, really special to be a part of it,” she later added. “Tragedy, in the good times, throughout everything. Like we really have something special.” Smart echoed the sentiment. “I think that the crew is as proud of the show as we are, even though they don’t get the accolades and the attention and the acknowledgment,” she observed. “The fact that they virtually – almost to a man – come back every season because they like being on our show is really heartwarming, flattering.”",

    "content": "Wink Martindale, a radio and television entertainer known to audiences as host of classic game shows including “Tic-Tac-Dough” and “Gambit,” has died. He was 91. Martindale’s death was confirmed in a news release from his representative Brian Mayes, who also told CNN he was a family friend. Martindale died Tuesday in Rancho Mirage, California. Born Winston Conrad Martindale in Jackson, Tennessee in 1933, he was transfixed from an early age by the family radio, eventually going on to succeed in the entertainment industry thanks to his talent, demeanor and that booming voice. According to the news release, Martindale started his career as a disc jockey in Jackson at 17, but quickly ascended the ranks to eventually work at WHBQ in Memphis, where in July 1954 Elvis Presley’s first record “That’s All Right” was played on the radio for the very first time by a fellow DJ. Due to the immediate and overwhelming demand, the other DJ played the song again and again while Martindale telephoned Presley’s mother and asked if Presley could come down to the radio station. The music legend soon arrived at WHBQ for his first interview. After this more than auspicious start, Martindale went on to a remarkable 74-year career, which included him finding gold-record success as a recording artist in his own right. His rendition of the spoken-word song “Deck of Cards” went to #7 on the chart and #5 on the UK Singles Chart, selling more than one million copies in 1959. That same year, Martindale became the morning DJ at KHJ in Los Angeles, moving again a year later to the morning show at KRLA and finally to KFWB in 1962. He enjoyed lengthy stays at many other radio stations, including Gene Autry’s KMPC from 1971-1979 and 1983-1987, the release said. Martindale is credited with having broken some of the biggest hits and artists of the 60s and 70s, spinning iconic songs for the first time on his radio shows. Martindale’s additional radio credits include “Hit Parade Radio” and the syndicated programs “Music of Your Life,” “100 Greatest Christmas Hits of All Time,” “The History of Rock ‘n’ Roll,” and recent recurring appearances on “The Howard Stern Show.” Alongside his radio and music pursuits, Martindale found success on television as well, ultimately becoming a perennial figure as a smiling and debonair game show host. His first break into TV was at WHBQ-TV in Memphis, as the host of “Mars Patrol,” a science-fiction themed children’s television series, and then as host of “Teenage Dance Party,” where his friend Presley made an appearance in June 1956. His first game-show hosting job came in the mid-1960’s, on NBC’s “What’s This Song?” followed by NBC’s “Words and Music,” CBS’ “Gambit,” and his biggest success, “Tic-Tac-Dough.” Martindale also went on to host other popular game shows like “Headline Chasers,” “High Rollers,” “The Last Word,” “The Great Getaway Game,” “Trivial Pursuit,” “Debt,” “Instant Recall,” and many more. In recent years, he made appearances on programs including “Most Outrageous Game Show Moments,” “The Chase,” and “The Bold and the Beautiful.” In 1985, Martindale became a producer with the launch of the TV game show “Headline Chasers,” produced in association with Merv Griffin and syndication giant King World. An avid philanthropist, Martindale supported various causes and produced and hosted annual telethons for Cerebral Palsy and St. Jude Children’s Hospital, among many other charities. In 2006, Martindale received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and in 2024, he was honored with a Beale Street Note on Memphis, Tennessee’s Beale Street Walk of Fame – not far from where in 2015, he was presented with the Distinguished Alumni Award by his alma mater, the University of Memphis, according to the news release. Martindale was also one of the first inductees into the American TV Game Show Hall of Fame. At the time of his death, Martindale was surrounded by family and his wife of 49 years, Sandra Martindale, the release said. Martindale is survived by his wife Sandra, sister Geraldine, his daughters Lisa, Lyn and Laura and a large extended family full of grandchildren and great grandchildren, his honorary son Eric and his beloved Chihuahua, Dude.",

The full cast roster has yet to be announced, including whether beloved “Lasso” cast members Hannah Waddingham, Juno Temple, Phil Dunster, Jeremy Swift and Nick Mohammed, among others, will reprise their roles. AppleTV+ did however confirm in the news release that Brendan Hunt and Brett Goldstein will return as executive producers, with Goldstein also continuing to serve as a cowriter on the series.

The news comes almost two years after the episode of “Ted Lasso” aired. The episode at the time felt like a punctuation mark on the show, in spite of it not being officially billed as a “series finale,” leaving the show’s future ambiguous. “Ted Lasso” debuted in 2020 and instantly became a hit, eventually becoming one of AppleTV+’s most-streamed shows. The comedy follows Lasso, an American college football coach who moves across the pond to serve as the coach of AFC Richmond, an English football team trying to come back from relegation. Lasso may not be the most skilled coach at UK football but, along the way, he injects his optimistic credos and sentimentality around every turn. The feel-good show won 13 Emmys, including outstanding comedy series and lead actor for Sudeikis. A release date for Season 4 has not yet been announced.",

    "content": "Dame is known for her regal screen presence, having won an Oscar for playing Elizabeth II in 2006’s “The Queen,” just one of her celebrated portrayals of royalty or nobility. It would seem as something of a departure, then, to see her in the new thriller crime series “MobLand” – where she plays Maeve, the scheming and martini-swilling matriarch of a powerful London crime dynasty opposite Pierce Brosnan. But Mirren thinks Maeve fits quite well into her esteemed repertoire. “I think of all the characters I’ve played, the closest I’ve come to playing a character like Maeve was playing Lady Macbeth in a Scottish play many years ago,” Mirren said in a recent interview with CNN. “She has a lot of those qualities: profoundly ambitious, and ruthless, absolutely ruthless.” “I guess Elizabeth I (who she portrayed in the Emmy-winning 2005 miniseries), and probably Catherine the Great of Russia (who she played in a 2019 miniseries) may be sort of similar, but they were more restricted by their culture and their station,” Mirren added. Co-directed by Guy Ritchie, “MobLand” features Tom Hardy – who, along with Brosnan, was a major reason for Mirren to become involved – as the “fixer” for the Harrigan family, cleaning up their many messes. Mirren thoroughly enjoyed working on the show, which she called “a dark soap opera.” Her character calls the shots, drink in hand, and knows the score before everybody else. Mirren isn’t interested in the power play only, however. “What makes a character actually interesting is not their power, it’s their vulnerability,” she shared, going on to openly wonder what, if any, vulnerability Maeve might exhibit. “She’s a villain in a piece about villains. It will be interesting to see, ultimately hopefully, where Maeve goes.” As for whether Mirren would consider taking on any royal roles again in the future, she said “never say never, but it’s unlikely. I feel I’ve done all the really interesting ones.” (Another standout: her portrayal of Queen Charlotte in 1994’s “The Madness of King George.”) “If something pops up that is really extremely different from what I’ve just done, then I’ll go for it,” she shared about her process of selecting roles. “And if something pops up, it might be great, but it’s very similar to something I’ve just done, I’ll usually step away from it.” “Because I just love to constantly be upsetting my own cart, you know, and make life difficult for myself,” Mirren added with a queenly smile. “MobLand” premieres Sunday, March 30 on Paramount+.",

The HBO drama’s recipe for heartbreak: Take safe zone Jackson, add a horde of hundreds of infected rising from the snow and smother it in game-changing tragedy. (Major spoiler ahead.) In the episode, search for Joel (Pedro Pascal) came to a climax as she tracked him down by sheer luck and slowly killed him, exactly as she had planned. Here’s how things played out. Abby and her crew finally made it to Jackson and set up camp at a cabin overlooking the town. But come daylight, they realized that the settlement was way more settled and sprawling than they expected. They had no real plan for how to get in or to find Joel. Meanwhile, Abby went out to take watch and spotted two people on horseback, later revealed to be Joel and Dina, who had gone out early on patrol together. To get a closer look, Abby tumbled down the snowy hill and landed in a pit of infected, who at first glance appeared to be frozen underneath the snow. Turns out, they weren’t frozen at all. Hundreds arose from the snow and began to chase Abby. One almost caught her until Joel saved Abby from harm, bringing her to a barn where Dina (Isabela Merced) and their horses were. Abby realized then that she found Joel after Dina said his name, and convinced them to bring her back to the cabin where she said her friends had supplies and could help them. Once at the cabin, Abby revealed herself and her motive. Mel (Ariela Barer) gave Dina a shot in the arm that Abby said would make her sleep for an hour, but before Dina went lights out, she noticed a patch on one of their backpacks that read “W.L.F.” – a clue about Abby and her crew that will likely come into play down the line. Abby shot Joel in the knee to disable him and proceeded to tell him that he killed 18 soldiers and one doctor that day at the hospital. But that doctor, she said, was her father. She said that there’s a code in the militia that she’s been with in Seattle for the past five years, that their commander trained them to not kill people who can’t defend themselves. Joel, she pointed out, was in that position now with his knee shot out, but she said she was going to kill him anyway. “Because it doesn’t matter if you have a code like me or you’re a lawless piece s*** of like you,” Abby told Joel. “There are just some things everyone agrees are just f*** wrong.” After Abby brutally beat Joel, Ellie (Bella Ramsey) happened upon the cabin and burst through the door to see Joel, nearly dead, lying bloodied on the ground. She was immediately restrained by Abby’s crew and sobbed for Joel on the floor, heartbreakingly screaming for him to “get up.” This is when Abby finished the job, stabbing Joel in the neck with a spear. Ellie screamed that she would find them and kill them, which seemed to be setting up how the rest of this season will play out, before she crawled over to Joel and laid with him. It was a devastating scene, punctuated by Jesse, Dina and Ellie later heading back toward Jackson on horseback, with Joel’s body wrapped in a white cloth being dragged behind them. Even more gut wrenching, earlier in the episode, Ellie told Jesse that even though there was tension with her and Joel, and even though they still hadn’t really confronted each other about that tension, that “I’m still me, he’s still Joel and nothing’s ever going to change that.” “This story is about how we all deal with those moments, which do confront us in life,” executive producer Craig Mazin said in a post-episode featurette. Executive producer and creator Neil Druckmann also set the scene for what’s to come during the featurette, saying that parallels between Abby and Ellie both losing their dads are now becoming more clear. “This event will change all the characters we know forever from this point on,” he ominously added.",

Camille Razat, who plays Emily’s (Lily Collins) frenemy of the same first name, will not be returning for Season 5, according to a cast announcement published on Netflix’s on Thursday. Razat has been a series regular for the past four seasons playing Gabriel’s (Lucas Bravo) on-again-off-again romantic partner. Razat the news on Instagram this week, writing that she’s “made the decision to step away from Emily in Paris.” “It has been a truly wonderful experience, one filled with growth, creativity, and unforgettable memories,” she added. “This character has meant a lot to me, and I feel that her storyline has naturally come to an end. It felt like the right moment to explore new horizons.” Among the cast members who are returning are Collins, Bravo, Ashley Park, Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu and Lucien Laviscount. Emily’s new Italian love interest Marcello, played by Eugenio Franceschini, will also be back. Bravo’s return to the series comes after the actor spoke out about his displeasure with his character’s arc, telling IndieWire in an interview last year that he was questioning if he wanted “to be part of Season 5.” Netflix also announced that the series will start production on Season 5 in May, filming in Rome before heading back to Paris later this summer. Season 4 ended with Emily being tasked with opening up a Roman branch of Agence Grateau. Of course, her love interest Marcello will be part of that story, further complicating her already complex romantic relationship with Gabriel as they work toward his restaurant earning a Michelin star. “Marcello is a whole other adventure that we want for Emily because we ultimately want Emily to be able to have a better work/life balance,” star Collins told Tudum. “We want to have Emily be able to smile without condition. We want to see her beyond her vacay mode. And he comes at that perfect time.” A release date for Season 5 has not yet been announced.",

It’s why Rhimes lovingly admitted on Tuesday during her speech at Pompeo’s that when she met the actress two decades ago during a lunch meeting, she was “a little bit terrified” of her. “After that lunch I went home and I literally wrote in my journal – I actually looked it up – ‘This girl is a spitfire, she will lay you out with the truth, up, down and sideways,’” Rhimes said. “I was absolutely thrilled and a little bit terrified because it’s rare to meet somebody like her.” Rhimes went on to say that “very few people actually are who they present themselves to be but Ellen is exactly who she says she is, and you’re one of a kind.” Pompeo and Rhimes go as far back as at least 2005 when “Grey’s Anatomy” first debuted on ABC. The network drama follows the life of Meredith Grey, played by Pompeo, a surgeon at the fictional Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital. The series is currently in its 21st season with Pompeo still leading the charge as the titular character. It is the on television, beating out “ER,” which ran from 1994 to 2009. Rhimes spoke on Tuesday about how even though as the showrunner and writer she created the character of Meredith Grey, Pompeo “is” her but, she added, ”she’s best when she’s simply herself.” “She’s fierce and funny and thoughtful and caring. She’s a businesswoman, a talented actor, a kind friend and a great mom,” she said. “And I don’t care who you are, even if you’re the most powerful showrunner in TV, if you step out of line Ellen will tell you about yourself!” Pompeo “lives and breathes in the truth,” Rhimes said, “and it’s come to be my favorite thing.”",

The “Last Night” singer addressed the moment while appearing on an episode of on Sunday, giving a simple explanation as to why it appeared he was so quick to leave the show. “I was ready to go home,” Wallen added. “I had been there all week.” Wallen was the musical guest on the March 29 episode of “SNL” and confused some viewers at the time when he suddenly left the stage during the show’s credits, where the cast and guests traditionally linger and hug each other. After giving the episode’s host Mikey Madison a brief hug, Wallen walked off the stage toward the side of the camera without acknowledging any of the show’s cast members. That same night, shortly after his departure, Wallen posted a photo of a plane on a runway with text across it that read, “Get me to God’s country” on his Instagram Story. The post caused speculation about his experience, which spawned an internet reaction as well as an in the following week’s “Weekend Update” segment of the show. A source familiar with the situation previously told CNN that the country singer used the same path to enter and exit the studio as he had all week during rehearsals, and simply walked that same way after hugging Madison. After the episode, longtime “SNL” cast member Kenan Thompson told Entertainment Weekly in an that Wallen’s exit was not “the norm.” “It just felt so abrupt,” Thompson said. “And it was already such a small grouping on the stage anyway.

    "content": "is decidedly not a film for the squeamish. The is one of the few horror flicks to be in categories beyond makeup (though it was deservedly nominated there, too). The excessive gore, much of which occurs while its actresses are nude, may have dissuaded some viewers from checking out the film that could win first-time nominee an Oscar for best actress. The splatter of “The Substance” is cartoonish and over-the-top. But its grossest scenes don’t register the same as a brutal kill in a typical scary movie because the violence here is so heightened — and has something to say, director Coralie Fargeat hopes. There are heaps of physical and psychic violence inflicted upon women in this film. The women commit the physical harm against each other, but it’s the emotional damage done by an ageist, misogynistic society that drives our protagonist(s) to harm themselves, Fargeat has said. “The movie is about women’s bodies, and to me, I couldn’t find a better way than body horror to show the violence that we can do to ourselves,” Fargeat said in an with IndieWire. The penetrating self-hatred that Elisabeth Sparkle feels throughout the film was inspired by Fargeat’s own damaging self-talk as she aged. “The level of violence I need to put on screen expresses the inner violence that all those issues have created inside of me,” Fargeat told IndieWire. “They are my tool to address it and to say something about it, and make something with it that I hope will hit people’s minds.” Moore plays Elisabeth Sparkle, a fading star who, on her 50th birthday, is ousted from her longtime gig hosting a -inspired TV workout series. Dejected and overcome with self-loathing, she takes the Substance, a mysterious injection that promises to create a “younger, more beautiful” version of herself. Elisabeth does know that the Substance will open up a massive tear in her back from which a nude, slick Margaret Qualley emerges. The pair has to split their time being “awake” — one week “on” for Elisabeth, the other for “Sue,” the name Qualley’s character chooses for herself when she’s “born.” They’re reminded by an ominous voice over the phone to “respect the balance.” That quickly goes sideways — and gets goopy. For those who want to be warned (or at least know when to look away), here’s a smattering of most of the gore that appears in the first two-thirds of the film (beginning with Dennis Quaid’s skeezy producer Harvey gobbling shrimp cocktail and spitting their heads and entrails inches from Elisabeth’s face): A car flips over several times in a harrowing accident. Menacingly long needles are inserted into and withdrawn from veins times. A woman’s naked back splits open. A slimy, adult-sized person emerges from the aforementioned back wound. The slimy, adult-sized person sews up the gaping hole from whence she came. Loose organs fall out the back of an unzipped jumpsuit. A full chicken drumstick is pushed up from a butt cheek and out of a belly button. Brittle bones are cracked back into place. A wound at the base of a woman’s spine grows increasingly infected and oozy. Much of the gore is intermixed with prolonged full-frontal nudity, slo-mo shots of Qualley’s baby-oiled backside or Moore crying in the shower. Fargeat has said that those scenes are commentaries on the way women’s bodies are viewed and scrutinized (though some have these scenes adopt the sexed-up male gaze that the film aims to critique). “It’s a way to show our vulnerability with our own bodies, and how much the way we look at the flesh can be so different when you’re alone in your bathroom, or you’re Sue in front of the camera and everyone is looking at your ass,” Fargeat told last year. The gory pièce de résistance arrives in the last third of the film, when Sue’s forbidden overtime has aged Elisabeth into a stereotypical hag, complete with an extreme hunchback, hooked nose and shriveled skin. Elisabeth prepares to kill Sue for the irreversible damage her younger double has done to her older body but can’t bring herself to finish the job. So Sue wakes up, and the two sides of Elisabeth Sparkle face off in a bloody battle until Sue beats her older self to death. Without Elisabeth’s genetic material, Sue’s body quickly starts to fall apart: She slowly pulls teeth from her gums. Her ear falls off. Her finger nail breaks and detaches. To protect her gig hosting her network’s coveted New Year’s Eve special, Sue injects herself with the “single-use” activator from Elisabeth’s original Substance kit. It goes poorly. Out of Sue’s spine emerges a creature with several breasts, toothless gums and maybe a single lock of dark hair. Her title card introduces us to , and here’s where the film goes for it. Monstro Elisasue shows up for the live taping and horrifies the audience, who turn on her after she coughs up a loose breast from one of her many orifices. One of her twisted arms is lopped off by an angry audience member and turns into a firehose of blood. (Oh, and Elisabeth’s original, un-Substance-ified face is grafted onto her monster-self’s back, screaming.) If you can’t stomach blood, this may be the most challenging sequence of the film. And yet, there’s something lovable about Monstro Elisasue, whom Fargeat to Vulture as “recomposed in a Picasso way with everything at the wrong place.” She’s brimming with confidence when she steps out onstage, which makes it all the more crushing when the audience rejects her for her appearance — an experience new to Sue. “The monster to me represents who we are for real, our whole humanity with its weakness, its truth and its imperfection,” Fargeat told Vulture. Eventually, Monstro Elisasue collapses into a pile of blood and guts, and out crawls Elisabeth’s original face. She pulls herself onto her faded star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and smiles, hallucinating praise and adoration from fans — finally “free from her human body and appearance,” Fargeat to Entertainment Weekly. Then she dissolves into goo, all living traces of Elisabeth Sparkle erased. In a film that’s mostly a blown-up caricature of Hollywood sexism, though, there’s one scene that abandons all artifice. About halfway through, Elisabeth rubs her skin raw as she applies, then removes, then reapplies her makeup as she prepares for and eventually cancels a date. There’s no goop, no prosthetics: It’s just Moore staring at herself in the mirror through the eyes of the TV executives who disposed of her, the audience that tired of her and the Sue version of herself who despises her. It’s a quietly devastating moment in a film that is almost always “pumped up” to 100. If you can make it through the rest of the bombast, you might just find yourself moved.",

He was 95. and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, were found dead in their home in New Mexico along with their dog, according to the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office. Hackman’s best roles were often of conflicted authority figures or surprisingly clever white-collar villains. Many held a hint – sometimes more than a hint – of menace. He won an Oscar for his portrayal of New York cop Popeye Doyle in 1971’s “The French Connection,” a detective who gets his man but at a high cost. His surveillance expert in 1974’s “The Conversation” is single-minded to the point of obsession, losing all perspective. Even in 1986’s “Hoosiers,” in which Hackman played perhaps his most heroic role – a small-town high school basketball coach – he seems to revel in the man’s flaws. Yet he was always watchable, even magnetic. His cackle alone, which film critic David Edelstein described as “that familiar, slightly sinister ‘heh-heh-heh,’” inspired a . “On one hand, he has the gravitas of the Lincoln Memorial. On the other hand, he has the physical forgettability of that middle-management guy in the seat next to you on the flight from Rochester to Omaha,” wrote Michael Hainey in a 2011 “I’d like to think that if an actor was playing me, that he would do me in an honest fashion. I always try to approach the work in that way, regardless of how good or bad the script,” he told GQ. Perhaps it was his status as a late bloomer that made Hackman so conscious of the need to strip his roles of adornment. He was 36 before he broke through in 1967’s “Bonnie and Clyde” – a role he got after losing the part of Mr. Robinson in “The Graduate.” Before that, he’d served in the Marines, scuffled in California and New York (sometimes with a roommate, “Graduate” star Dustin Hoffman) and worked odd jobs, including truck driver and doorman. Still, he was fine just with being an actor – regardless of how others viewed his un-movie star face. “Neither Dustin nor myself looked like the leading men of that era, especially Dusty because he wasn’t tall,” he told Film Comment in 1988. “We were constantly told by acting teachers and casting directors that we were ‘character’ actors. The word ‘character’ denotes something less than attractive. “I accepted the limitation of always being the third or fourth guy down, and my goals were tiny,” he continued. “But I still wanted to be an actor.” In the beginning, Hackman was lucky to be anything. He was born January 30, 1930, and grew up in Danville, Illinois. His parents divorced when he was an adolescent, and his father, a printing press operator, deserted the family. Hackman, 13 at the time, could still see his father’s goodbye wave in an interview more than four decades later. “I hadn’t realized how much one small gesture can mean,” he told Parade in 1989. “Maybe that’s why I became an actor.” The lack of a father, he added, gave him his hardworking drive; his mother, who had musical talent, and his infirm grandmother, who lived with the family, gave him a fondness for the arts. “I was too young to be left alone, and she was too old to be left alone, so I became very close with her,” he said of the latter. “She was a great storyteller.” He lied about his age to get into the Marines and served five years as a radio operator. He was brash and sometimes angry – he didn’t sugarcoat his attitude in interviews – and moved to Pasadena, California, in 1952 to take up acting. While there, he fell in with Hoffman at the Pasadena Playhouse. The two were voted “least likely to succeed.” That didn’t stop the pair, who moved to New York and became friends with a third struggling actor, Robert Duvall. Hoffman and Duvall became roommates; the three scavenged for parts. Hackman starting getting breaks in 1964, first on Broadway with “Any Wednesday” and then in the movie “Lilith.” The lead in “Lilith” was Warren Beatty, and he didn’t forget his co-star, still climbing, when he was casting “Bonnie and Clyde” a couple years later. Hackman’s performance as Clyde’s brother, Buck Barrow, brought him an Oscar nomination. At this point, Hackman could have relaxed into a long television career: He was the first choice for the role of Mike Brady on “The Brady Bunch.” But a combination of factors – including Hackman’s decision to pursue challenging movie roles and a contract eventual “Brady” star Robert Reed had with its studio – prompted Hackman to take such roles as the no-nonsense coach in 1969’s “Downhill Racer” and the conflicted son in “I Never Sang for My Father.” The latter earned him his second Oscar nomination. He wasn’t the first choice for Popeye Doyle, the combustible detective pursuing a heroin shipment in 1971’s “The French Connection.” According to Hackman, Robert Mitchum, Rod Taylor and New York newspaper columnist Jimmy Breslin were all ahead of him. Even after being cast, he had trouble with the role. An early scene had him punching a drug pusher, and Hackman found it difficult to do the violence. “I felt terrible, and the scene was no good. That night, I told (director) Billy Friedkin he should consider replacing me,” he told . Friedkin didn’t, and Hackman eventually clicked. Indeed, he clicked so well, he won an Oscar for best actor. The film took home five Oscars, including best picture. His next film was a 180-degree turn: producer Irwin Allen’s all-star disaster epic, “The Poseidon Adventure.” Hackman played a mod priest who leads the trapped passengers of an overturned ocean liner to safety. “When I was working on it, I was kind of ashamed of myself,” he told the UK . The film was a huge box-office success, anyway. Hackman’s roles were usually pensive and dramatic, but he occasionally ventured away from his comfort zone for comedy. He was a blind hermit in a hilarious scene in Mel Brooks’ 1974 film “Young Frankenstein” and a in 1978’s “Superman” and its sequel. Years later, Hackman gave an impulsive spark to Royal Tenenbaum, the patriarch of a neurotic clan in Wes Anderson’s 2001 film “The Royal Tenenbaums.” Despite his talent, Hackman wasn’t always in great films. In interviews, he was as blunt about the successes (1981’s “Reds,” he said, was “difficult”) as the failures. “Hoosiers,” which became a classic, “passed him by,” he told GQ. “I took the film at a time that I was desperate for money. I took it for all the wrong reasons, and it turned out to be one of those films that stick around,” . “I never expected the film to have the kind of legs it’s had.” He was sometimes the best thing in bad films. “So many of his roles take (his reliability) for granted and do not think to test him,” wrote David Thomson in the “The New Biographical Dictionary of Film.” For his part, Hackman said, “I suppose a lot of it comes from early days when there wasn’t any work.” But when he had the material, he was a champion. He won his second Oscar for his performance as Little Bill Daggett, the violent sheriff in Clint Eastwood’s 1992 best picture winner, “Unforgiven.” (It was another role he almost turned down, ) “Gene Hackman gives one of his most powerful and least mannered performances, displaying an implacable strength and controlled passion that form the essential counterbalance to Eastwood’s own considerable force,” wrote Kenneth Turan in in 1992. He was intimidating in 1993’s “The Firm,” amusing in 1995’s “Get Shorty” and stolid in 2000’s “The Replacements.” But with a handful of exceptions, the latter part of his career seemed to be a series of military men, villainous government officials and lawyers. His last film was inexplicable: the little-seen and poorly received 2004 comedy “Welcome to Mooseport.” At 74, he quietly retired and stuck to it. He became a man of leisure in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and turned to other arts, painting and writing. Another good role never came along. “I don’t have a project, Larry. If you have a script, I’ll read it,” he told Larry King in 2004, a few months after “Mooseport’s” release. “It’s probably all over.” For Hackman, that was OK. He never saw himself as a leading man anyway. “You’d like to (have) been fourth star in all those MGM movies?” King asked. “Yes,” replied Hackman. “I would have liked to have done that.”",

    "content": "Perhaps attempting to prove that of its box office have been greatly exaggerated, Marvel on Wednesday announced major casting news for its upcoming “Avengers” sequel that both flex the power of its history and set it up for the future. A major component to their plan: The return of characters and actors from the original “X-Men” franchise, a Marvel property that was under the 20th Century Fox banner before Disney purchased that studio in 2019. The “Avengers: Doomsday” cast now includes Sir Patrick Stewart, who has portrayed Professor X in multiple “X-Men” movies, Sir Ian McKellen as adversary Magneto, James Marsden as Cyclops, Rebecca Romijn as Mystique and Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler. All of these actors last appeared together in 2003’s beloved sequel “X2: X-Men United.” Kelsey Grammer, who famously played Beast in 2006’s “X-Men: The Last Stand” and showed up in a post-credits scene in 2023’s “The Marvels,” will also appear, Marvel revealed. The jam-packed cast for “Doomsday” – set to premiere in theaters in 2026 – was announced via s and included 27 names in all, including the previously announced return of Robert Downey Jr. in the . Joining the “X” alums are Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) mainstays Chris Hemsworth, who has played Thor since 2011, Anthony Mackie as Captain America, Sebastian Stan as The Winter Soldier, Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, and Simu Liu, who played Shang-Chi in his . Later in the livestream, it was announced that Tom Hiddleston – who has played Loki in both the MCU and in – will also be featured in “Doomsday,” as will Channing Tatum, who portrayed X-Man Gambit in an in last summer’s “Deadpool & Wolverine.” Wyatt Russell as U.S. Agent, David Harbour as Red Guardian, Tenoch Huerta Mejía as Namor and Letitia Wright as Shuri – from the “Black Panther” and previous “Avengers” films – will also make appearances, Marvel announced. Florence Pugh is also set to return as Yelena Belova, after her debut in 2021’s “Black Widow” and following Alums won’t have all the fun. All four actors set to be introduced in this summer’s “ ” – Pedro Pascal, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Vanessa Kirby and Joseph Quinn – were also announced as part of the “Doomsday” mega-cast. While many of these actors have enjoyed previous appearances in the MCU or other Marvel properties, it remains unclear how substantive their roles will be in the new film, and going forward. Notable absences from the superheroic lineup include Scarlett Johansson – who last week sounded off on the to the MCU – along with Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch, Benedict Cumberbatch’s Dr. Strange and Mark Ruffalo’s fan-favorite Hulk. The Avengers’ last official team-up was in 2019, for the record-breaking “Endgame,” which saw both the defeat of intergalactic supervillain Thanos (Josh Brolin) and the death of flagship MCU superhero Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.). However, it was revealed last year that for this next go-round, but as the titular baddie Dr. Doom. At the end of Wednesday’s livestream, Downey Jr. appeared and sat in a director’s chair with his name on it, before the stream concluded. After the success of “Endgame,” the MCU has faced several hurdles and box office misfires including 2021’s “Eternals” and “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” in 2023, but still enjoyed some success in the form of “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” and “Deadpool & Wolverine.” But with last month’s “Captain America” sequel and the upcoming “Thunderbolts*” slated to fall short of the expectations that “Endgame”-era MCU fare was able to muster, there’s a palpable sense that the hardy MCU superheroes have peaked. “Doomsday’s” monstrously stacked cast list is perhaps the studio’s answer in part and a look at how it plans to find its way back to the glory days – with a little help from a couple dozen friends. “Avengers: Doomsday” is currently in production and set to hit theaters on May 1, 2026.",

    "content": "’s newest film “Sinners” is already generating , and a lot of it has to do with a video shared days before the release. Last week, Kodak posted that between YouTube and TikTok has racked up around 1 million views, in which Coogler makes complex topics like aspect ratios, film formats and sound design accessible and fun. He does this largely thanks to how the video uses his latest vampire-crime thriller hybrid “Sinners” as the primary example. Coogler seems comfortable in professor mode as he talks through the different film formats in the video, while film strips of different sizes and a whiteboard chock full of detailed drawings are displayed behind him. His passion is clear as he starts off with a quick explanation of Super 8mm film, Super 16mm film and some technical terms. Regarding shooting on actual celluloid – which is increasingly rare in today’s digital and video-centric age – he says, “It’s a format that I fell in love with when I was in film school, so I brought a few film strips here.” The “Black Panther” director also mentions other notable recent movies that were shot on film, including After making sure everyone is up to speed, Coogler then explains how he and his team shot “Sinners” on two camera systems: Ultra Panavision 70 and IMAX. Ultra Panavision 70 is the widest format available and will crop the screen along the top and bottom, while IMAX is the tallest format and will crop on the left and right sides of the screen, the director says. Coogler’s latest project draws on his Southern roots and family history to deliver a paranormal tale about two brothers who open a juke joint in their Mississippi hometown. The film is led by Coogler’s longtime collaborator Michael B. Jordan, who plays twin brothers Smoke and Stack. “Sinners” is only hitting screens nationwide on Friday, but it has already made history. This is the first time that a movie has been shot simultaneously with two different aspect ratios (as described above), and it’s also the first time that a movie has been released combining both, Coogler specified in the Kodak clip. Cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw, who also worked on “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” also to shoot a theatrical feature film on both 65mm and IMAX. The film will therefore be available for viewing in several formats, with some showings shifting between aspect ratios depending on the emotion and intensity of a scene in select theaters – another first. Coogler hasn’t shot on film since his breakout “Fruitvale Station” from 2013 – which also starred Jordan – and his return to the medium is about more than achieving a shallow depth of field and high resolution, he says in the Kodak video. The filmmaker wanted to create a moving theatrical experience like the ones he experienced in his youth, he said. “My parents was working class in Oakland, and it was the most affordable way for us to go out and have a good time. I still believe in that,” Coogler said. “Sinners” opens Friday in theaters nationwide. It’s distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.",

    "content": "In “ ,” Lupita Nyong’o voices Roz, an intelligent droid who must navigate the challenging natural world of the future. The DreamWorks film, based on the classic children’s book by Peter Brown, has nabbed three Oscar nominations this year – including best original score, best sound and best animated feature – but it has also earned a lesser-known distinction. – a nonprofit that helps TV and film creators tell stories that “honestly reflect,” even in part, climate-related issues – last year a -like test that explores how climate awareness shows up in the content we watch. After this year’s Oscar-nominated movies were put to the test, “The Wild Robot” stands as the only one to pass muster. The criteria for the test are relatively simple. The film or TV show must take place on Earth, be set in the present, recent past, or future, and the following two statements must be true: climate change exists in the world of the story, and a character knows it. While it sounds easy enough, this year’s crop of Oscar picks failed to clear those conditions, save for “Robot,” “with its stunning portrayal of our watery future,” according to Good Energy’s released on Thursday. The question is, how can movies and TV shows that depict climate change spur viewers into action, or even to just become more climate aware, without scaring them? It’s that climate-related emergencies have grown more common and urgent in today’s world – just look at the recent wildfires that of Los Angeles, or hurricanes and last fall, which left the southeastern United States grappling with the loss of more than and in damages. With that comes a renewed focus on how climate awareness and normalization is represented in popular culture, which is where Good Energy’s new tool comes in. “Humans are wired for stories,” Anna Jane Joyner, founder and CEO of Good Energy, told CNN in an interview. “TV and film have a profound impact on shaping public opinion and behavior,” she added, going on to cite how TV shows in the 1980s led to a stark decline in alcohol-related driving fatalities or how a 2020 GLAAD report found that a clear majority of Americans felt TV shows and movies influenced their acceptance of LGBTQ+ people. Joyner and others are eager to see the same happen when it comes to climate awareness, with stories featuring characters that model conscientious behavior with regard to the planet and our collective footprint – not just people running and screaming from some natural disaster. “We must meet the moment, which means we must create stories that shift our relationship to our earth,” said adrienne marie brown, a writer, podcast host and climate justice activist who styles their name lowercase. She added that it is “non-negotiable” to include themes of climate change and activism in popular film, television and beyond. “Climate catastrophe impacts and threatens everything that lives,” brown, who recently published the book “ ,” also said. “We need stories that show what’s coming, how to prepare and build community.” But both brown and Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson – a marine biologist and policy expert – are adamant that modeling climate activism in popular culture need not be all about just ringing warning bells. In fact, Johnson told CNN there’s even space for in this area. “What I personally would like to see, what I have pitched,” said Johnson, who recently published “ ,” “is more climate rom-coms. Where the meet-cute is, like, at a composting facility. They bump into each other with their food scraps!” Her ideas don’t stop there. “Like, you’re trying to go on a romantic ski trip, and there’s no f***ing snow! Right?” This is just life now, Johnson added. So having climate themes integrated into movies organically – say, two people “falling in love in the context of an electric car charging station,” she brainstormed – could be a way to reach more audiences. brown also talked about the need for “stories that show us a compelling future” as opposed to a bleak one, as seen in movies like the Jake Gyllenhaal-starring “Day After Tomorrow” from 2004, or the more recent “ .” These films are often grouped under “There is a part of what’s coming to us that is inevitable,” brown acknowledged. But she also stressed the “need to normalize people being prepared for cataclysmic change as communities” and “weave it in and make it joyful, sexy, admirable and powerful to love the earth.” “I actually don’t think we need more apocalyptic stories,” Johnson shared. “We’re all very clear on what the bad version of the future is. But what kind of future do we get if we actually deploy all the solutions we have?” Those solutions include things like renewable energy, more public transit, regenerative agriculture and more, she said. “I really do feel like we can take climate change seriously without taking ourselves seriously,” she added. “The sort of sanctimonious earnestness, or intensity and terror, doesn’t really work for everybody.” There’s a place for humor in storytelling around climate awareness and activism, too, Johnson said. She mentioned AppleTV+’s winsome comedy “Ted Lasso,” in which the teammates decide as a group to no longer allow an oil company to sponsor their team because the business wreaked havoc in the African country from which one of their players hails. “I thought that was just such a smart way to do it,” she said. Johnson was also quick to point out how the climate activism implicit in the storyline was properly contextualized. “At no point did it feel like, ‘Wait, how did this get to be about climate?’” she said. “It was just like, ‘Of course, a creepy oil company would be trying to take advantage.’” For Joyner, there is a pressing and personal stake in getting more climate-normalizing stories out there for mass consumption. She lives on the Gulf Coast of Alabama, and her family has roots there for five generations. During Hurricane Sally in 2020, they had to evacuate in the middle of the night as the region was blindsided. “Every year, I see my home disappearing before my eyes. I’ve struggled with climate anxiety, anger, fear, and grief – as do millions of people,” she said. “I need to see my world on-screen. I need help making meaning of all this – and finding joy, courage, and possibility in the midst of it.” Acknowledging climate change in our stories is as simple as “authentically writing about what it feels like to be alive today,” Joyner added. “Showing the climate crisis in our stories helps audiences process their own difficult emotions, and find the courage to face it,” she said. “We need to talk about it in our stories so that we can talk about it in real life. We need to explore what it means to be human in this new age of climate change.”",

    "content": "Spring has sprung, and with it comes a fresh bouquet of offerings at the local cineplex. While not season just yet, this spring’s movie lineup includes some big titles. Here’s a roundup of some of the standout cinema arriving in theaters from now through Memorial Day: A sometimes thrilling, often silly genre mashup featuring Paul Rudd and Jenna Ortega, this movie trots a path between fantastical mystery, creature feature and gross-out gore flick. With some unmissable easter-egg tributes to films like “Aliens,” “E.T.” and “Jurassic Park,” “Unicorn” looks like a horse of a time at the movies, also thanks to a sidesplitting and scene-stealing Will Poulter. Dealing with a beast of an entirely different nature, “The Friend” stars Naomi Watts as a writer grieving her mentor (Bill Murray) who ends up inheriting his enormous dog. From the trailer alone, the film looks undeniably heartwarming, if you’re into that whole (wo)man’s-best-friend sort of thing. It’s based on the novel by Sigrid Nunez. In the spirit of “Red Eye,” this sleek thriller places an unsuspecting woman (“ ” Season 2 breakout Meghann Fahy) in the crosshairs of a maniac while she’s on a date with a handsome suitor (“It Ends with Us” star Brandon Sklenar). Utilizing today’s sometimes invasive smartphone technology as a major plot device, “Drop” looks like it takes more than a few twists and turns before it hangs up. Written and directed by Iraq War veteran Ray Mendoza along with Alex Garland – filmmaker behind last year’s “Civil War” – “Warfare” is a harrowing true-to-life account of a Navy SEAL platoon as they engage in combat while embedded in an Iraqi home, told in real time. From the trailer alone, this one is not for the faint of heart. Wrirter/director Ryan Coogler reunites with his “Black Panther” and “Creed” star Michael B. Jordan for this eerie-looking movie that is part period piece, part crime thriller, and yes, part vampire movie. Featuring Jordan in two roles, “Sinners” also stars Hailee Steinfeld (of “Bumblebee” and “True Grit” fame) and “Get Shorty’s” Delroy Lindo. Cowritten by James Schamus, who helped pen Ang Lee’s Oscar-nominated 1993 film of the same name, “The Wedding Banquet” follows a gay Korean man (Han Gi-chan) who makes a deal with his lesbian best friend (Kelly Marie Tran) to get married so he can get a green card to remain with his boyfriend (“SNL” star ). All goes according to plan until his meddling Korean grandmother (Oscar-winning actress Youn Yuh-jung of “Minari”) shows up. Also featuring Joan Chen and . From landmark director David Croneberg (“The Fly,” “Dead Ringers”), “The Shrouds” is a dark look at death and grieving, with a measured dose of weird tech nightmare thrown in. Featuring a stellar international cast including Vincent Cassel (“La Haine”), Diane Kruger (“Inglourious Basterds”) and “The Brutalist” Oscar-nominee Guy Pearce. Minus Anna Kendrick but featuring a beefed up role for Jon Bernthal, this sequel to the 2016 noir crime thriller catches up with Ben Affleck’s Christian Wolff as he gets snared in another complex web of murder, math and intrigue. Look for the return of Oscar-winner J.K. Simmons’ Ray King as well as Cynthia Addai-Robinson’s Marybeth Medina. Remember the Marvel Cinematic Universe? It’s back, after a relatively low-key year (with only last summer’s “ ” on the 2024 theatrical slate). This entry – following last month’s – rounds up a ragtag group of antiheroes (think the MCU equivalent to DC’s “Suicide Squad”) including Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, David Harbour and Wyatt Russell, with Julia Louis-Dreyfus’ shady Valentina Allegra de la Fontaine presiding. After this weekend’s release of the live-action reimagining of the classic “ ,” next is an updated version of the 2002 animated movie about a lovable alien ‘dog’ and the girl who comes to adopt him. The astounding eighth entry in this Tom Cruise-starring spy franchise, this final mission brings back Ving Rhames, Angela Bassett and Hayley Atwell, and welcomes newcomer Nick Offerman. Seems like just yesterday that Cruise went on his inaugural mission in 1996, in the hit first film based on the Bruce Geller-crafted 1960s TV show.",

Starting in 2027, the popular independent film-centric festival will move to another snow capped mountain town in Boulder, Colorado, according to a news release from the Sundance Institute. “Boulder offers small-town charm with an engaged community, distinctive natural beauty, and a vibrant arts scene, making it the ideal location for the Festival to grow,” the release read. The move marks the first time the Sundance Film Festival will take place outside of Utah, where it was first established by its founder Robert Redford in 1981. “I founded the Sundance Institute with a commitment to discovering and developing independent artists, with the Sundance Film Festival serving as the platform for stories to help expand audiences and broaden the landscape,” Redford said in a statement. “That mission remains even more critical today and will continue to be our core principle.” Redford added that while he has “sincere gratitude” for Park City being the festival’s home for decades, he is “grateful to the Boulder community for its support, and I look forward to seeing what the future holds for the Festival there.” Colorado Governor Jared Polis said in a statement on Thursday that Colorado is “thrilled” to welcome the festival. “Here in our state we celebrate the arts and film industry as a key economic driver, job creator, and important contributor to our thriving culture. Now, with the addition of the iconic Sundance Film Festival, we can expect even more jobs, a huge benefit for our small businesses including stores and restaurants,” he added. Cincinnati, Ohio was also considered as finalist city for the festival’s home, according to the Sundance Institute release.

    "content": "Ryan Gosling is set to embark on a journey to “a galaxy far, far away” in a new “Star Wars” movie. The “Barbie” star will join forces with director Shawn Levy for “Star Wars: Starfighter,” slated for release in May 2027. Set to begin production this fall, the movie will be set approximately five years after “Star Wars: Episode IX – The Rise of Skywalker,” released in 2019, but will sit outside the Skywalker story as a standalone film. “The film… is an entirely new adventure featuring all-new characters set in a period of time that has not been explored on screen,” said a statement from Lucasfilm, the owner of the “Star Wars” franchise. Details of the film were announced at the Star Wars Celebration, a fan event in Japan on Friday. The audience was shown a photo of Gosling’s childhood “Star Wars”-branded bedding before he told them he was “dreaming about ‘Star Wars,’ before [he] ever saw it.” “It’s always been there, it’s sort of in the DNA of the culture. Myself, I think it framed my idea of what a movie even was,” Gosling said in a panel with Levy. “The script is just so good, the story, it has so much adventure, so much heart and original character. It’s an opportunity to shine the light into a side of the universe that we may not have seen,” Gosling said. Levy, the director of “Deadpool & Wolverine,” told the crowd the film would have all the “fun of ‘Star Wars’” but it would be done “in ways that are new and original.” “Because obviously you take on ‘Star Wars,’ you take on something this beloved, it’s intimidating, you’re scared, you’re nervous, you want to get it right. But we have a feeling that with this story, with this collaboration, we can get it right,” he added. The “Star Wars” universe has massively expanded since Disney purchased the franchise in 2012, with the company commissioning a sequel trilogy to the original Skywalker storyline as well as a series of spinoff films and series. Between 2015 and 2019, Lucasfilm released a new “Star Wars” film each year, including “The Force Awakens,” “The Last Jedi,” and “The Rise of Skywalker,” in the Skywalker series and standalone titles “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” and “Solo: A Star Wars Story.” The franchise has also branched into streaming with titles including “The Mandalorian,” “The Book of Boba Fett,” “Obi-Wan Kenobi,” and “Andor” on Disney+. The next movie in the franchise, “The Mandalorian & Grogu,” a spin-off of “The Mandalorian” series, directed by Jon Favreau, will hit cinemas in May 2026.",

The actress, dog food maven and mom of three recently spoke to about a sequel to her beloved 2008 romantic comedy, and teased that there’s a reason to hope that it’ll walk down the aisle at some point in the future. “I think that we’re in talks about a ’27 Dresses’ sequel, which, if done right and with that cast I love so much, would definitely be something I’d be willing to sort of compromise the mom time to do,” Heigl shared. “It would have to be done right, but you don’t want to diminish the first one at all,” she continued. “You want to add to it. So, if we can do that and pull it off, I think that would be really fun. And I think they’re working on that.” In “27 Dresses,” Heigl played Jane, a 27-time bridesmaid who must again serve in someone else’s wedding – her sister’s – who is marrying her boss and crush. The film also starred Judy Greer, Malin Akerman, Krysten Ritter and Edward Burns. Heigl – who most recently was seen opposite Sarah Chalke in Netflix’s “Firefly Lane” – isn’t the only one who is open to a “27 Dresses” sequel. James Marsden, who played her love interest in the movie, said to “bring it on” in 2023. “That movie weirdly has legs that I’m not sure I anticipated it having,” he added at the time. “Just a fanbase that people – when they talk about romantic comedies – you don’t really see too many of those made nowadays.”",

    "content": ", a movie star for over 30 years, doesn’t think the public knows her as well as they think they might. In a new conversation with actress Jenna Ortega published in this week, Portman said that as a child actor, she was “really sexualized,” which she felt “very scared by.” It caused her to develop an outward persona as a strategy to shield herself. “And I felt like my way of protecting myself was to be like, ‘I’m so serious. I’m so studious. I’m smart, and that’s not the kind of girl you attack.’ I was like, if I create this image of myself, I’ll be left alone,” she said. The Oscar-winner added that she reasoned at the time, “if I create this image of myself, I’ll be left alone. It shouldn’t be a thing, but it worked.” Portman said that this conception of her has led to a “disconnect” in how she actually can be “stupid and silly in real life, and people thinking that I’m some really serious bookish person.” Portman even told Ortega that in real life, “I’m not a particularly private person,” adding “I’ll tell you anything.” In public, however, “it was so clear early on that if you tell people how private you are, your privacy gets respected a lot more.” Ortega admitted, “I don’t really know what that line is. I guess I’m still figuring that out.” Portman’s career took off when she starred in Luc Besson’s “The Professional” at 13 years old. She played a hard-boiled orphan in New York City who becomes targeted by gangsters, ultimately gaining protection from an Italian hitman (Jean Reno). Portman is next set to star in “Fountain of Youth,” a movie premiering on AppleTV+ next month. She will also be costarring opposite Ortega in upcoming film “The Gallerist.”",

Pugh’s grandmother Pat Mackin appears to love the limelight just as much, according to the star, who said on Wednesday’s of “Late Night with Seth Meyers” that Mackin “absolutely loves it” and “laps it up” whenever she comes to her granddaughter’s premieres. “Even when I’m not there for the premiere and I send my family and friends to it, she will enter and she will have fans on either side of the fences being like, ‘Granny!’” Pugh said. “She will turn around and curtsy and pirouette and blow kisses. It’s like she’s a queen.” Pugh added that her grandmother, who she referred to as Granny Pat, also came to visit her on the “Thunderbolts*” set along with Pugh’s mom while they were filming the latest Marvel movie, where she got to call out “action” and “cut.” The film’s director Jake Schreier “gave her that permission,” Pugh said, going on to joke that they then “all slightly regretted it because she didn’t really listen to any of the details as to how to call action and cut.” “No one was ready yet but everyone had to quickly fall into motion,” Pugh said, laughing. “And she found it very funny… She just found it thrilling.” While Pugh said that Granny Pat “loved” the new MCU movie, she and her grandfather had a bit of a different reaction to seeing “Midsommar,” the wild 2019 horror film in which Pugh starred. Her grandfather, Pugh said, told her after the film that he “probably wouldn’t have watched it if you weren’t in it.” At the end of the day, she said, her family are her biggest supporters. “They will be there and they will show up in full Pugh force,” she said. “They are just massive supporters no matter what I do.” “Thunderbolts*” will be released in theaters on May 2.",

    "content": "“ ,” the Academy Award-winning film directed by Edward Berger and starring Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, Isabella Rossellini and John Lithgow, opens with a sobering sequence in which several prominent figures in the Roman Catholic Church gather around the recently deceased pope behind closed doors. The movie, which was in March, brings to life the heady mix of mystery, ritual and tradition, but most of all the politics of the papal selection process. It’s based on the 2016 thriller by British novelist Robert Harris, which describes itself as a tale about the “power of God and the ambition of men,” and imagines what the next conclave could be like. Central to the storyline is the tension among the most senior figures in the church, between the demands of their faith and the desire for high office. The film depicts the sotto-voce discussions in Vatican corridors and the subtle, behind-the-scenes politicking involved in a process where anyone seen to be campaigning for the position is likely to be ruled out. But “Conclave” has faced criticism from some within the church. Bishop Robert Barron, the founder of the Word on Fire Catholic media ministry and one of the most followed Catholics in the world on social media, told his followers on X to “run away from it as fast as you can.” He described it as ticking “practically every woke box” and sending a message that the only way forward for the church is to embrace “the progressive buzz words of diversity, inclusion, indifference to doctrine.” He said the film unfairly portrays the church hierarchy as a “hotbed of ambition, corruption and desperate egotism, Conservatives are xenophobic extremists and the liberals are self-important schemers.” The movie tries to showcase the battle for the soul of the church that takes place during a papal election, highlighting tensions between progressives and traditionalists, the role (or lack thereof) of women and, in the case of Fiennes’ character, Cardinal Lawrence, a crisis of faith. For church-watchers, the big question for the is whether the cardinals choose a pope who continues in the more open mold of the late , or whether forces opposed to his papacy will be able to shift things in an alternative direction. For the cardinals, the challenge will be finding a candidate who has a broad enough appeal and the personal credibility to be chosen for the role. While this is a political consideration, in Catholic theology the electors are supposed to be guided by the Holy Spirit. Steven P. Millies, the director of the Bernardin Center at Catholic Theological Union, a theological college in Chicago, said the movie’s depiction of the process is verified by reports from cardinals that conclaves are an exercise in “careful coalition-building” as they weigh up the church’s future. “A conclave is a political event in the best sense of politics — it is a thoughtful, even prayerful consideration of a community’s future,” he told CNN last year. “The ‘politicking’ does not deny the involvement of the Holy Spirit (it doesn’t guarantee it either, of course). Whether the Spirit is heeded is up to the cardinals. But the Spirit is present, and the vote-counting is a necessary part of the process.” To avoid outside lobbying and ensure cardinals are free to pick who they think is the best man for the job, conclaves take place in strict confidentiality, with participants sequestered away from the world. They are forbidden from speaking to anyone outside of the process, which can take several days, including reading media reports or receiving messages. This aspect is well-represented in the 2024 film. Only cardinals below the age of 80 have a vote. They cast them in the Sistine Chapel, in front of the awe-inspiring sight of Michelangelo’s “Last Judgment,” writing their choices on paper ballots that are then burnt after being counted. Rounds of voting continue until one candidate has a two-thirds supermajority. The crowd waiting outside is informed that a pope has been elected when the chimney above the Sistine Chapel billows out white smoke. “Conclave” works hard to be as realistic as possible. Harris was helped with his novel by the , who took part in the 2005 and 2013 conclaves, while the screenwriter, Peter Straughan, and the filmmakers were given a private tour of the Sistine Chapel. The movie gets many details right. We see cardinals wheeling in their overnight bags as they start the process and scenes of them having a cigarette beforehand. It recreates the rooms in the guesthouse – the Domus Sanctae Marthae – where the cardinals stay during the conclave, with communal meals and buses ferrying them back and forth between voting sessions. We are also shown the sealing of the deceased pope’s room and destruction of his ring in the beginning of the movie, the oaths sworn by the cardinals before voting, the use of chemicals to ensure that the correct color of smoke issues from the chimney to indicate the result (black for no decision and white to show a pope has been chosen), and the sweeping of the Sistine Chapel for listening devices. There are, however, small things it gets wrong, such as details of how the tables are laid out in the Sistine Chapel and the way cardinals address each other. But the least believable part of the film is its unlikely ending, which we won’t give away here. Tom Reese, a Jesuit priest and church commentator based in Washington, DC, gave CNN this verdict: “(The) acting and production values were great, but the plot twists were bizarre and unbelievable.” For Millies, however, the film is not primarily about the final plot twist or even about the processes of choosing a pope. He sees it as a story of one cardinal grappling with his faith, and finding it again – something he describes as “beautiful to watch.”",

    "content": "Before there was “American Idol” and “The Voice,” there was “Making the Band.” The reality series began on ABC in 2000, with Lou Pearlman, the man behind the boy bands the Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC, forming the group O-Town on the show. But it was the subsequent seasons, overseen by Sean “Diddy” Combs, that most people associate with the franchise. “Making the Band” moved to MTV in 2002, with Combs looking to form a hip-hop group. In the early aughts, “Total Request Live” and MTV’s reality-TV lineup carried oversized pop culture influence. “Making the Band” has recently returned to public consciousness, due to the mogul’s ongoing federal sex-trafficking trial in Manhattan. Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. One of the witnesses for the prosecution, singer Dawn Richard, first met Combs as a contestant on“Making the Band.” She testified Friday that she once witnessed Combs drag his former girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, by her hair. Separately, of sexual battery, sexual harassment and false imprisonment in a 2024 civil lawsuit. Combs has denied her allegations. “It’s unfortunate that Ms. Richard has cast their 20-year friendship aside to try and get money from him, but Mr. Combs is confidently standing on truth and looks forward to proving that in court,” an attorney for Combs said in a statement to CNN at the time the lawsuit was filed. Richard, whose testimony continued on Monday, is just one of the people who have worked with Combs who has said he could be tough. Viewers of the “Making the Band” franchise witnessed glimpses of it as well. Contestants on “Making the Band 2” lived together in New York City, where they were mentored by Combs and others as they competed to become part of mainstream hip-hop and R&B through a record deal with his Bad Boy Records. In one memorable scene, requested contestants Dylan Dilinjah, Rodney “Chopper” Hill, Lloyd “Ness” Mathis, Sara Stokes, Frederick “Freddy P” Watson and Lynese “Babs” Wiley walk miles to Junior’s Cheesecake in Brooklyn and return with dessert for him. They were not allowed to use any public transportation. “Y’all can walk from here, get the cheesecake, see the city, enjoy the sights, would ya.” Combs told them. He added, “It’s not about me trying to do a mean-spirited initiation hazing act.” “There’s a bigger picture to it,” Combs said. “In the world of music, I have to get up every day and do a bunch of s**t I don’t wanna do.” The episode became comedic fodder for . “Making the Band 3” premiered in March 2005, showing Combs as he sought to put together an all-girl singing group. It lasted for three seasons and resulted in Richard, Aubrey O’Day, Shannon Bex, D. Woods and Aundrea Fimbres forming the group Danity Kane, who enjoyed success with singles like “Touching My Body” and “Damaged.” Richard, O’Day and Bex about their experiences on the show in 2018, including when Combs fired O’Day after he accused her of being “promiscuous.” “It wasn’t about her being ‘promiscuous,’” Richard said at the time. “It was about the power to prove, I own your career.” O’Day added, “And I’m not promiscuous. I didn’t lose my virginity until my senior year of college.” “It wasn’t even about that. It gave him an excuse,” Richard said. “It was to let you know, ‘This is my show, this is my s**t, and I want to prove to you that it’s my s**t and I’m going to show you how much power I have over you by saying I’m going to control your lives.’” She described Combs’ behavior as “extremely sexist.” Bex pointed out that O’Day didn’t shy away from conflict with Combs. “Whenever you had conversations with him, it was almost like you were asking, ‘Is this OK?,’” Bex told the publication. “And Aubrey didn’t like to bring the apprehension, so she was like, ‘No! This is what it is.’ He didn’t like that.” Combs did not comment at the group’s remarks at the time. O’Day hasn’t stopped speaking up. She’s offered criticism of Combs and how she has said he treated her in interviews over the years. On a recent ” podcast, O’Day criticized Combs as a parent because six of his seven children, ages 18 to 33, have been present during some of the explicit testimony at his criminal trial, calling it “selfish.” “The fact that the kids are marching up to that court,” O’Day said. ”[I] don’t know any father that would want their children to sit through [that kind of] testimony.” And while O’Day was in New York City, she said on the podcast that she is not scheduled to be called to testify in his criminal trial. “I posted on my Instagram that I was here in New York and enjoying myself because I wanted to make it clear to everyone that I am not here testifying,” she said. “Making the Band” ended in 2009.",

    "content": "On the surface, rapper Kid Cudi and music mogul appear to have a few things in common. Both lost their fathers when they were young and have praised their mothers for their strength as single parents. The two men also rose through the ranks of hip-hop to become Grammy-winning, multiplatinum selling performers. But while Combs’ fame was expanded through his reality TV shows and annual White Parties, Kid Cudi has been more private and selective about the aspects of his life he chose to share. The man born Scott Mescudi is stepping into a different kind of spotlight this week, as a witness called by prosecutors in . Combs has pleaded not guilty. Prior to Combs’ criminal case, Mescudi was included in a filed in 2023 against Combs by his former girlfriend, Cassie Ventura. Mescudi and Ventura had a brief relationship in 2011, when she and Combs were in a “rough patch” in their relationship, according to her lawsuit. “Mr. Combs found Ms. Ventura’s phone and found emails between her and Kid Cudi. Mr. Combs became enraged and proceeded to place a manual corkscrew between his fingers and lunged at Ms. Ventura,” her complaints states. Ventura “ran away to stay at Kid Cudi’s home to escape Mr. Combs’s wrath” but ultimately returned to Combs after allegedly “feeling like she could not escape Mr. Combs and his network of enforcers.” “Mr. Combs told Ms. Ventura that he was going to blow up Kid Cudi’s car, and that he wanted to ensure that Kid Cudi was home with his friends when it happened,” Ventura alleged in her lawsuit. “Around that time, Kid Cudi’s car exploded in his driveway.” Through a spokeswoman, Mescudi confirmed Ventura’s account that he had a car that exploded. “This is all true,” the spokeswoman told the in 2023. Mescudi has not publicly commented on the incident since. Combs and Ventura settled her lawsuit the day after it was filed. He admitted no wrongdoing. The federal indictment against Combs includes reference to using arson as a threat. In her time on the witness stand last week, Ventura testified about Mescudi’s car being torched, reiterating what was in her civil suit. By testifying in the Combs trial, Mescudi will be giving the public insight into a life he has seemingly worked hard to protect. The 41-year-old Cleveland, Ohio, native came into the music industry as a protégé of Kanye West. He released his debut album “Man on the Moon: The End of Day” in 2009 and has recorded a total of ten studio albums throughout his career. He won two Grammy Awards in 2012 for “All of the Lights,” a song on which he collaborated with West. In 2020, Mescudi’s collaboration with Travis Scott on “The Scotts” claimed the No. 1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100. Mescudi has also appeared on screen in TV series such as “Westworld” and “How to Make it in America,” as well as films like “Don’t Look Up” and “X.” Away from his creative projects, Mescudi that he had struggled with anxiety, depression and substance abuse in his past. During a fundraising dinner for New York–Presbyterian Hospital’s , Mescudi explained that he was 11 when his father died. As a youngster, he got “really good [at] masking the madness over the years, being the youngest of four, staying in my place, being quiet, entertaining myself,” he said. The pressure of the spotlight and substance abuse as an adult led to mental health struggles, Mescudi said. “I was darker than I ever had been in my life,” he added in his remarks, so he sought help. “Since rehab, I’ve been pacing myself with work. For example, I don’t drop an album every year anymore; I do it every other year,” he reflected. “That was one of the things that drove me mad up until 2016, because I was dropping an album every year and that took its toll on me.” CNN has reached out to representatives for Mescudi for comment.",

    "content": "TV and radio personality Big Tigger remembers a moment he had years ago with Sean “Diddy” Combs. The DJ had connected with Combs at the music mogul’s restaurant, Justin’s, and a photographer captured a moment of the two men talking about life. “I still had the picture and I had given it to my grandmother before she passed. It was a really great picture, like me and him just had a conversation about family,” Big Tigger recalled to CNN. “He had already had some of his kids and I had told him, you know, I hadn’t had any yet, and he was just talking about family and how important family was to him. And I never forgot that personal conversation.” Combs is no longer in the position to easily offer such wisdom. His federal sex-trafficking trial in Manhattan is entering its third week. Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that include racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. Cassie Ventura, an artist and former girlfriend of Combs whom he also produced, has spent more than 15 hours on the stand this week, detailing disturbing allegations of abuse she said she suffered at the hands of Combs. Dawn Richards, another artist who worked with Combs as both a solo singer and a member of the girl group Danity Kane, which Combs founded on his MTV reality series “Making the Band,” is expected to testify next week. Ventura settled a civil claim with Combs in 2023. He admitted no wrongdoing. Richards filed a lawsuit in September 2024, accusing Combs of sexual battery, sexual harassment and false imprisonment. He has denied her allegations. It’s not the trajectory many expected for the founder of Bad Boy Records, whose music and artists ruled the airwaves in the 1990s and early 2000s. Big Tigger likened him to Berry Gordy, the founder of Motown Records, for a younger generation. “I lightweight grew up a little bit to Puff with the music, and then by the time I actually got into the business, he was already Puff,” Big Tigger said, referring to one of Combs’ many nicknames. “Puff from a business standpoint and a possibility standpoint was an inspiration.” The influence of Combs extended beyond the music industry, as he also had various businesses that included fashion, hospitality and spirits. But music - from being an intern at Uptown Records to founding his own label - is what opened the doors to those other industries for Combs. Many of the artists he helped introduce to the world have so far been silent about his legal issues. Here’s what some of them have said - or not said - since Combs has been accused of running afoul of the law. The rapper was a frequent collaborator with Combs and signed to his label. And while they had joint success on songs like 1997’s “Can’t Nobody Hold Me Down” and the late Christopher Wallace a.k.a. The Notorious B.I.G’s hit “Mo Money Mo Problems” that same year, Mase and Combs fell out after he accused Combs of exploiting him and other Bad Boy artists, which Combs denied. Mase recently attended to the funeral service for Wallace’s mother Vonetta Wallace which Comb’s adult son Christian Combs also attended. Mase he would be open to reconnecting with his former mentor. “I mean, if my name was on the list I’d go visit Puff,” he said. “I would visit him, make sure he was good.” He expressed his gratitude to Combs for helping to launch his career, adding that he has no idea as to whether Combs is innocent or not. “He didn’t do all bad, he did some good. I ain’t talking about the tape stuff and all of that, I’m talking about the musical side,” Mase said, referencing a 2016 . “Giving me an opportunity, I think as a person of class you definitely got to show up and sit somewhere in the court if they let you.” Blige was signed to Uptown Records, where Combs served as a producer on her debut album “What’s the 411?” The pair established a long-standing friendship, working on music together as well as supporting each other’s projects. Combs often referred to the singer as his “sister.” She returned the kinship in September 2023 when she presented Combs with the Global Icon Award at the MTV Video Music Awards. “Congrats to my brother @diddy #GlobalIconAward #vma,” Blige She has not publicly commented on the allegations against Combs. Moses “Shyne” Barrow was an up-and-coming recording artist in 1999, when he was signed to Combs’ Bad Boy Records. He was part of the producer’s entourage at a New York City nightclub, along with Combs’ then-girlfriend, Jennifer Lopez, when the evening ended in a hail of gunfire. Three people were wounded. Barrow, Combs and bodyguard Anthony Jones were tried in the shooting in 2001. Combs and Jones were acquitted, while Barrow was convicted on assault and firearm possession charges. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison and deported to his native Belize following his release in 2009. Barrow told CNN in an interview last year that he blames Combs in part for the events that derailed his life and career. “You know, there’s so many things that I said so long ago about Diddy. Nobody would listen, nobody would believe,” Barrow said. “And it makes the wounds that I’ve, by the grace of God, been able to heal and the accomplishments that I’ve been able to achieve even much more significant.” The event is a pivotal part of the Hulu documentary about his life titled, “ .”  Barrow said he and Combs reconnected 20 years later, but he is clear that he didn’t witness the events which resulted in the current allegations against Combs. “I didn’t have the opportunity to engage with him to see any of those things and when I didn’t engage with him, I didn’t see any of those things,” Barrow said. The female rapper was instrumental in the early success of Bad Boy. As a member of the group Junior Mafia along with her former love interest Wallace, Combs was a featured artist on her single “No Time,” a hit from her 1996 debut album, “Hard Core.” She returned the favor on his 1997 hit, “All About the Benjamins.” That same year, ,” where she explained that they initially met through Wallace, who was Combs’ best friend and one of the biggest stars on his label. “It’s funny cause when I first met [Combs] I thought he didn’t like me cause he would lick his tongue at me or maybe make a funny face,” she said at the time. “But then as the years went by I saw how much love he had for me, so I love you Puff and I’m so happy for you.” She also showed off the diamond earrings she said Combs has gifted her. Lil Kim has not commented publicly on the allegations against Combs. After auditioning for producer and label owner L.A. Reid Raymond, Usher was sent at the age of 15 to learn from Combs at “Puffy Flavor Camp.” The now adult music star and actor . He said it was a heady experience being a teen in the 1990s in the Bad Boy sphere, surrounded by so many famous and artists, not to mention the women. “They weren’t there for me,” Raymond said of the groupies. “Howard, they were not my chicks. But I did recognize that, yo, one day this could be my lifestyle.” He has not spoken publicly about the allegations. Evans was not only an award-winning singer on the Bad Boy label, she was also married to Wallace, who was shot and killed in Los Angeles on March 9, 1997. Known as “The First Lady of Bad Boy Records,” she and Combs worked together frequently. Their single “I’ll Be Missing You” honored Wallace after his death. She spoke with about Combs on the red carpet for Clive Davis’ Pre-Grammy Gala in 2020. “Puff has always been, way before Bad Boy saw the actual success in commercial sales and stuff like that, he was still a visionary,” she said. “He still very much knew what was gonna make a hit record, he knew good talent, and he actually had ideas for all of us…He would tell me, ‘You’re gonna be this,’ and ‘I’m gonna make him into that’…and it happened.” Evans has not spoken out about the allegations against Combs. Big Tigger said he understands why some those who were part of Combs’ inner circle may not currently be comfortable talking about him. “Anytime you say anything about sexual assault or anything in that lane, no one wants to be attached to that,” he said. “Our society is so quick to lump people together. If I just say, I went out there [to Diddy parties]…now all of a sudden I was probably there and I’m covering for him and this and that. I don’t think people are running to sign up for that.”",

    "content": "Not everyone is loving the sketches coming out of the latest high-profile legal drama. With cameras prohibited from the federal courtroom for the Sean “Diddy” Combs trial, media outlets, including CNN, have employed courtroom sketch artists to illustrate the proceedings for the public. The sketches have sparked occasional criticism on social media for being cartoonish. The has even used AI to help dramatize the trial. is a Baltimore-based courtroom sketch artist who has been in the business since the 1970s. He considers his profession more a form of journalism than art and said there are plenty of critics of both. “Sometimes we don’t do great drawings,” he told CNN. “You’re not working under the best conditions. And also, I will say that some of the sketch artists are not really that good.” Lien said he was actually fired from his first gig. “I did such a terrible job, but it was really the materials I was bringing in. They weren’t good for the courtroom,” he recalled. “It was watercolors and they ran. I figured out the problem and I told them, ‘Just let me go back and you don’t have to pay me, but just let me’ and they hired me back.” Having worked on several highly-publicized cases, including Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh’s trial, Lien said his sketches have faced a fair amount of scrutiny over the years, like the ones he drew of , who was convicted for his part in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. Rolling Stone magazine had put a photo of Tsarnaev on the cover and he “looked kind of romantic,” the artist said. “When I did my sketches of him in the courtroom that were not as flattering, I just got all this feedback from young women who had kind of fallen for Tsarnaev,” Lien recalled. Social media - with a never-ending scroll of video and photos - has conditioned the public to expect realistic images in real time. Sketches of celebrities with famous faces are subject to even more judgment. is an illustrator, cartoonist and concept artist who has also worked for years as a courtroom sketch artist. He said the case for having cameras in courtrooms include the need for transparency, as well as the desire to “increase the peoples’ faith in the judiciary process and give them greater trust.” But he also understands why some trials aren’t streamed or photographed. “Cameras tend to emphasize what’s dramatic rather than what’s important. They’re not always the same thing,” said Hohnstadt, who lives in Minnesota. “You can have something sensational - but maybe isn’t really directly related to the substance of the trial and the charges - that plays better in a video that gets shared and goes viral on social media.” “Social media rewards a rush to judgment, and the whole point of a trial is to reserve judgment until you’ve heard both sides,” he added. has been sketching the Combs trial for CNN. As she enjoys her 50th year as a courtroom artist, Cornell said she’s become less concerned with what people on social media may think about her work. “Diddy’s mom said she liked my work,” Cornell added. “She tapped me on the shoulder and she gave me a thumbs up and an okay sign.” Combs is just the most recent celebrity whose likeness she has tried to capture. Some of Cornell’s past work includes NFL superstar Tom Brady’s “Deflategate” case and John Gotti’s trial in which his underboss, Sammy “The Bull” Gravano, flipped on the famous mobster. Cornell, who is based in New Jersey, has been capturing the action at trials for so long that she’s seen a lot of changes. “It used to be news crews would wait for us outside and we’d tape [sketches] up against the wall or against the side of a news truck, and various stations would stand in line to take their turn,” she told CNN. “Then we got clever.” Because she had a husband who was a “techie,” Cornell said, she was an early adopter of using her phone to take pictures of her sketches to send them electronically to her clients. What has not changed, Lien, Hohnstadt and Cornell all agreed, is the need to make sure you have a good vantage point in court. The time allotted also matters because it’s more difficult to get an accurate sketch if the courtroom action is quick, they said. Most importantly, Hohnstadt emphasized, sketch artists act as surrogates for those who cannot be in the room. “I try to portray what’s happening as fairly as I can and look for things that are interesting or dramatic, but not in a way that editorializes or not in a way that takes away from the substance of what’s really happening,” he said. “Sometimes the most important stuff looks boring.”",

    "content": "Clarksdale, Mississippi – which serves as inspiration for the setting of the Michael B. Jordan-starring film “ ” – does not have a local cineplex, which led community organizer Tyler Yarbrough to behind the project to host a screening in the city. Yarbrough, along with Clarksdale mayor Chuck Espy, spoke to CNN’s Victor Blackwell for the segment on Saturday, and shared their hopes that the screening will become a reality. “Clarksdale is a ways away from a movie theater,” Yarbrough said in an interview, later adding that it took him about an hour and a half to drive to a theater that was showing the film. Espy pointed to depopulation and lack of funds as contributing factors to the loss of Clarkdale’s two movie theaters, also detailing that most community-and family-centered venues started gravitating toward Memphis, Tennessee, some 80 miles away. “I’m really excited for the opportunity to have potentially cast members to come and to give people an opportunity to have a real feeling and a real dialogue, so they can immerse themselves in something that the country has not seen,” he shared, referencing the heritage of his city. “A lot of people are at the table to try to bring this to fruition,” he also said. “People from over a 2-hour radius are talking about coming to Clarksdale to see this event.” Neither Espy nor Yarbrough said any plans for the screening have been finalized, but Yarbrough mentioned “several conversations” he has been a part of with “Warner Bros. executives.” He said the screening is “looking very promising” to happen sometime between now and Juneteenth, but no details have been confirmed. “We are asking Michael B. Jordan the rest of the cast. We’re talking about studio execs,” Espy said. “Every single person that has touched this wonderful film launched a great release. We’re asking them to come to Clarksdale.” CNN has reached out to Warner Bros. Pictures for comment about the potential screening. “Sinners,” a period piece/crime thriller/vampire horror hybrid from “Black Panther” director , has and garnered positive reviews. The film is produced and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, which is owned by CNN’s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery. In it, 1930s Mississippi is seen as a burgeoning and fertile place where blues music is created, as characters perform in moving cars and a is thrown together for the community to enjoy. “Clarksdale is a melting pot. It has so many people that come from New Zealand, Australia, all around the world for the authentic feel of the blues,” Espy shared, later adding that the city’s legacy “has been going on for over a hundred years about the heritage of the Mississippi delta and the rich legacy of the blues.” “So people come from all around the world just to touch the sacred soil of this city, to say ‘I was there, where the blues was born.’” Yarbrough also mentioned how in a perfect world, he would be able to convince the “Sinners” production team and cast to not only come for a screening and conversation, but also to explore some of what contemporary Clarksdale has to offer. “We also wanted the cast to come down and experience our juke joints, to experience our museums like the Blues Museum,” among other things, he said. “I really love a part of the movie that Coogler captured very well was just showing how the blues is the foundation. And you saw one scene where he intertwined all the different genres, from from hip-hop to pop to rock into this one scene, and there’s a lot of power in that that locals need to see,” Yarbrough said. “And so I think when it comes to this screening and everything, too, we’re really trying to connect local folks, Deltans, to that power. So we can remember that we’re powerful.” CNN’s Hyan de Freitas contributed to this story.",

    "content": "CNN will exclusively televise actor George Clooney’s record-breaking Broadway show “Good Night, and Good Luck,” on Saturday, June 7, the network announced Thursday. The limited-run play’s penultimate performance from the Winter Garden Theatre in New York will air live on CNN and CNN International and stream on CNN.com at 7 p.m. ET. “This announcement marks a historic Broadway first: never before has a live play ever been televised,” the network said in a news release. The show is an adaptation of the 2005 movie Clooney directed of the same name and is based on veteran journalist Edward R. Murrow’s work and tension with Republican Sen. Joseph McCarthy during the Red Scare of the 1950s. The play, which debuted in March, swiftly shattered weekly records, becoming the highest-grossing play in Broadway history. It has also earned five Tony Award nominations, including Clooney for best leading actor in a play. “I can’t tell you how exciting it is to do something that’s never been done. CNN is the perfect place to bring this story of courage to so many more people than we could have ever hoped. Live TV. No net. Buckle up everyone,” Clooney said in the news release. Discussing the play in a , Clooney stressed the importance of journalism in preserving democracy, citing the veteran journalist’s words. “It doesn’t matter what political bend you are on – when you hear things like, you know, ‘We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and a conviction depends on evidence and due process of law, and we will not walk in fear of one another. We won’t be driven by fear into an age of unreason,’ I think those are extraordinarily powerful words for who we are at our best,” Clooney said. The play comes at a time when the Trump administration has launched attacks on media, including from some of President Donald Trump’s events and attempting to . Clooney – a major Democratic donor – has repeatedly spoken out against Trump. And ahead of the 2024 presidential election, Clooney co-hosted a star-studded fundraising for then-President Joe Biden before Biden’s disastrous performance at CNN’s presidential debate that ultimately led him to drop out of the race. According to a forthcoming book from Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson, – whom he had known for years – at the fundraiser, leaving the actor “shaken to his core.” Less than a month after the interaction, Clooney released an of the race.",

In , the president criticized Bruce Springsteen for “go[ing] to a Foreign Country to speak badly about the President of the United States.” The president’s comments come days after Springsteen during the first show of his latest tour with the E Street Band. Speaking at the Manchester-based concert on Wednesday, Springsteen branded the Trump administration “corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous,” calling on “all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experience to rise with us.” “Raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring,” Springsteen said at the Mancunian show. The setlist was a marked departure from the band’s post-pandemic shows. While the last few years have seen Springsteen play a mostly autobiographical, introspective set devoid of the political statements that have been the hallmarks of his career, the performance on Wednesday — Springsteen’s first since Trump returned to the Oval Office — included several. A representative for Springsteen did not respond to a request for comment after Trump’s social media post. Trump’s Truth Social post also saw the president accuse Springsteen of “not (being) a talented guy,” an ironic allegation given Trump previously featured the rocker’s “Born in the U.S.A.” at multiple rallies without Springsteen’s consent. The post also slammed Springsteen for speaking out against the president while abroad rather than while on US soil. “This dried out ‘prune’ of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country, that’s just ‘standard fare,’” Trump wrote. “Then we’ll all see how it goes for him!” Springsteen has supported and campaigned for several Democratic candidates throughout his career.

    "content": "Like a plot out of an emo band music video, The All-American Rejects’ joyfully hectic house party tour made a stop in a Missouri college town over the weekend only to have their show shut down by the police, who turned out to be familiar with the music. The band – particularly known well and loved by Millennials and likely played daily over the speakers at your grocery store of choice – have swung through cities in the midwest this month and made some unlikely stops along the way, like backyards and, in one instance, a bowling alley. On Sunday, the band performed in the backyard of a house near the University of Missouri in Columbia. According to a posted to the band’s official TikTok page, the show was ultimately shut down by the police, who allowed the band to play one final song. “I guess we’re getting kicked off campus,” the band’s lead singer Tyson Ritter said to the crowd in the clip. As the crowd cheered and screamed-sang along, the band played their popular 2008 hit “Gives You Hell” before concluding the show. Mark Fitzgerald, the Columbia Police Department’s assistant chief of police, told CNN in a statement Wednesday that the band, their security staff and the crowd were “very cooperative” with officials, despite the concert being “in violation of several local ordinances.” The officers that responded, according to Fitzgerald, “listened to a couple of songs” before the patrol sergeant informed the band and their security staff of the rules. The sergeant, Fitzgerald confirmed, “allowed the band to play a final song before they ended the concert.” “The Sergeant told me that he knew exactly who the band was and listened to them a lot while he was in college,” Fitzgerald added. “The Police Department would be happy to have the All-American Rejects return and play in Columbia, hopefully with the proper permits and approval. CNN has reached out to a representative for the band. The show in Missouri marked the All-American Rejects’ fifth house party show. They previously played in Green Bay, Chicago, Ames and Minneapolis. During their Minneapolis stop, they added another show because of the turnout, Ritter said in a posted to his TikTok. The show took place at Memory Lanes, a local bowling alley. The band has been teasing another show – the location of which has not yet been announced – set for Wednesday night. It will be live streamed on their official TikTok page. The seemingly impromptu shows were sparked by a pop-up concert that took place last month at a house on the USC campus in Los Angeles, according to Ritter. “We’ve been overwhelmed with the reaction to our LA house party pop-up,” Ritter in a video posted to the band’s TikTok page earlier this month. “We see all your comments and DMs requesting these house parties in your city and we’re going to make it f***ing happen.” Those interested in hosting a performance by the band can via a form posted on several of the band’s social media pages. They have documented each performance on their social media and have been promoting the release of their latest album, titled “Sandbox,” out on Friday. The All-American Rejects, formed in 1999, became ubiquitous with the emo music genre during the 2000s when they released their self-titled debut album, which included their first big hit “Swing Swing.” They are also best known for hits released throughout the decade including “Move Along,” “Dirty Little Secret,” “Gives You Hell” and “It Ends Tonight.”",

    "content": "White supremacy. Racism? Diversity, equity and… It’s a tough time to talk about racism in America. The country is in the midst of a in which the mere mention of terms like “racism” or “diversity” invites . Teachers have been books and investigated for invoking those terms. The acronym (diversity, equity and inclusion) has become what the author George Saunders an “omni-pejorative,” an all-purpose slur that is “deliberately vague.” It’s no wonder that some Black commentators that America is entering a second a term used to describe a low point in race relations that began in the late 1800s and carried into the early 20th century. It was a time when blatant racism was common among White political leaders, and lynchings were routine. What can a person who cares about racial justice do to get heard in today’s grim racial climate? Make a vampire movie. That’s what filmmaker has done with “ a horror movie that’s become a cultural phenomenon while earning more than $220 million at the domestic box office since its release last month. (The film is produced and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, which is owned by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.) “Sinners,” which follows Black twin brothers (both played by Michael B. Jordan) who open a juke joint in rural Mississippi during the Great Depression, has earned a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes. Critics praise the film’s blend of vampires and Black folklore, offering an array of explanations for its success. Black moviegoers have turned out in large numbers to see it. But there’s another, more frightening reason why “Sinners” is resonating — one that most critics have missed. Darkened movie theaters are among the few public spaces left in America where Black people feel free to vicariously express their horror over the recent, head-spinning changes to the country’s racial climate. Many successful films, TV series, songs and other entertainments mine the untapped emotions of their audiences. “Sinners” is no different. Consider two recent events that occurred soon after the film’s release in mid-April: In addition, two seismic developments have driven a stake into the heart of the 2025 racial justice movement. In his second term, President Trump, who has a history of making racist public statements, has waged war on DEI efforts within the government and in public schools and universities. And the Black Lives Matter movement has been neutered by over the organization’s financial transparency and allegations of , along with the inevitable that follows any racial progress in America. I’ve witnessed this despair myself. I have never seen such a widespread feeling of hopelessness among my Black friends and family. “Sinners” is set in the Mississippi Delta in 1932, but part of its appeal are its nods to today’s bleak racial landscape. There are clever references to , mass incarceration and a White vampire who claims he’s a victim of reverse racism. In the film, every movement toward interracial unity is seen as a deadly trap. “We believe in equality,” says the film’s lead villain Remmick (Jack O’Connell), while flashing a vulpine grin to a group of skeptical Black juke joint patrons. “Can’t we be for one night family?” he asks. We can’t, Coogler’s movie implies. There’s not a single sympathetic White character in the film. That’s the movie’s unspoken message: White America sucks the life out of Black culture, dangling promises of equality that can never be. I watched “Sinners” in a theater filled with Black people. There I saw something I hadn’t seen since my father snuck me into theaters when I was a boy to watch 1970s “ ” films like “Superfly” and “Blacula.” When a Black character in “Sinners” dispatched a racist White character at point-blank range in a particularly gruesome way, many people in the audience whooped and applauded. “We was never going to be free,” a Black character tells another near the end of the film, after their lofty plans fail. “Sinners” does offer plenty of There are scenes depicting the beauty and resilience of Black culture — the sweaty transcendence of our music; the West African spirituality that we blended with Christianity to make something new; the playfully raucous way Black folks talk to one another when White folks ain’t around. For 2 hours and 17 minutes, Black people and their allies can sit in a darkened theater and still believe that Black lives matter. They can escape into a story where Black characters affirm their anger and disenchantment — and not have to worry about getting fired, arrested or losing their funding. And yet this is one of the most frightening movies I’ve ever seen — not because of anything on screen, but because of its undercurrent of Black despair. “Nothing could be a more terrifying backdrop for a story involving creatures of the night than a world already determined to ignore your screams for help,” wrote critic Cuba Jimenez in an about the movie. That sentiment is the other monster that stalks the screen in “Sinners” — the kind of despair can’t be stopped by garlic or a crucifix. Screenings of “Sinners” may be one of the few public places left where Black Americans can freely express their emotions. And that’s more chilling than any drooling monster a filmmaker can conjure.",

    "content": "Tom Cruise was last at Cannes in 2022, when the film festival gave him an honorary Palme d’Or and, in return, got one of the last bona fide Hollywood stars to grace their red carpet as he launched “Top Gun: Maverick.” Fighter jets swooped overhead, and Cruise, who hadn’t been to the festival in 30 years at that point, flashed that megawatt smile. Before you knew it, “Maverick” soared past one billion dollars at the box office. Which needed the other more – the festival or the star? It doesn’t matter, the formula worked so well they commissioned a sequel to the whole spectacle. On Wednesday night, Cruise ascended the steps of the Palais de Festivals once more for the gala premiere of “Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning.” As the cast assembled on the red carpet, an orchestra struck up a live rendition of Lalo Schifrin’s theme tune, Cruise flashed that smile and… well, as Jerry Maguire once said, “Show me the money.” The film, which leans heavy on the franchise’s three-decade legacy, played well with the audience. Inside the Grand Theatre Lumiere, there was sporadic applause throughout for Cruise’s spy Ethan Hunt, series regulars Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames and newer recruits including Hayley Atwell. Prolonged applause during the credits gave way to some words by director Christopher McQuarrie, who recalled being “one of those kids who didn’t quite fit in” when he was growing up. “A lot of my life was imaginative play. I got to grow up and have my very own action figure, who was actually willing to do just about any crazy thing I could think of,” he said, gesturing to Cruise. “I’m grateful for your support, your friendship, your insanely unquestioning devotion to this craft, and most of all for your artistry,” McQuarrie, a four-time director in the “Mission” franchise, added. Cruise for his part noted McQuarrie’s expansion of the franchise’s ambitions while looking forward to making “a bunch of other kinds of movies” with the director. The comment further muddies the picture of whether this is the final “Mission: Impossible” film. It was unclear from the film’s marketing if that were the case, and it remains unanswered even after watching all 165 minutes of the movie. Shot in the UK, South Africa and Svalbard in the Arctic, “Final Reckoning” picks up where 2023’s “Dead Reckoning” left off, with Cruise’s Hunt pursuing the destruction of pervasive AI enemy The Entity. The stakes, already high, are ratcheted up significantly; arguably, Hunt and co. have never faced a graver scenario. An exposition-heavy opening third, prone to repetition, offers a wobbly scaffolding on which Cruise and McQuarrie hang some truly spectacular set pieces. If the film spent less time worrying about explaining itself – or drifting into a reflective, sometimes somber mood – it might be more straightforward and more fun. That said, when Cruise is firing all cylinders, in the well-advertised acrobatic biplane scene, and a nightmare-fuel deep sea diving sequence, he’s a marvel to behold. The actor has long been in a category of one when it comes to his on-screen pursuits, and this is no different. It’s no easy task for a director to keep up with Cruise, but McQuarrie does admirable and inventive work, and wisely lets the action do the talking when the film is at its best. Despite the positive notices at Cannes, “Final Reckoning” will face stiffer headwinds than Cruise hanging off the side of an airplane to reach profitability. The film reportedly cost around , and studio Paramount will no doubt be nervous given “Dead Reckoning” relatively underperformed. The 2023 film, originally billed as “Dead Reckoning – Part One,” grossed – down from the franchise’s peak of for “Fallout” in 2018 – although it was faced with the box office tidal wave of “Barbenheimer” shortly after its release, something the latest movie has steered clear of. Will “Final Reckoning” be a critical and commercial slam dunk like “Maverick”? Paramount will care more than Cannes and more than McQuarrie. The festival got its star, and the director got to play with his action figure once more.",

    "content": "Ari Aster is currently living in a state of blissful ignorance. It won’t last long. The director of “Midsommar” and “Beau Is Afraid,” who has brought his politically volatile work “Eddington” to the Cannes Film Festival, admits he hasn’t seen any of the online reactions to his movie. “I’ve been very deliberately avoiding the discourse about the film,” he told CNN during a packed and often impassioned press conference at the festival on Saturday. “I’ll probably dip my head into the swamp and see what the f***’s going on in there, or something, but I haven’t done it yet.” “Eddington,” starring Joaquin Phoenix, Pedro Pascal, Emma Stone and Austin Butler, is set in small-town New Mexico during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. Phoenix’s sheriff is baffled by mask policies and the apparent hysteria among the townspeople, while Pascal’s mayor is toeing the line (while also making dubious business deals with big tech to build a data center on the town’s outskirts). Their contretemps predates the pandemic, rooted in their relationships with the sheriff’s wife, an aloof, clearly depressed Emma Stone. The small-town drama is pulled wider by news events, namely the death of George Floyd and the protests movement that followed. Aster shoehorns all manner of hot-button topics: identity politics, social media silos, false flag attacks, and the allure of conspiracy theories, all facilitated by the wholesale erosion of truth in the digital age. The film is proving a potent Rorschach test. Less than 24 hours after it premiered, there’s already plenty of online chatter about where “Eddington’s” own politics stand, with commentators of all stripes – some sight unseen – making the case it speaks for them. “I wanted to paint a picture of the society that we’re now living in,” said Aster. “And I didn’t want to attach myself to one ideology or one story or one belief system, because it’s too narrow. That’s not the point, y’know? The film is designed to be ambiguous in certain ways.” “What the film is about, for me, is about what happens when people who are so isolated and are living in their own realities – what happens when they come into conflict with each other,” Aster explained. “When you start bumping up against each other, a new logic is created, and out of that, people start amplifying each other’s fears.” Earlier at the press conference, the director discussed how the project began. “I wrote this film in a state of fear and anxiety about the world,” he said. “I wanted to try and pull back and just describe and show what it feels like to live in a world where nobody can agree on what is real anymore.” “I feel over the last 20 years we’ve fallen into this age of hyper-individualism … that social force that used to be kind of central to liberal mass democracies – which is an agreed upon version of the world – that is gone now,” he added. “Covid felt like the moment where that length was finally cut for good,” Aster said. “I wanted to make a film about just what America feels like to me and what it felt like to me at that time.” Journalists pressed the actors and director more than once on the current state of America. One questioned if actors had fears of reprisals for making movies with political messages. “Fear is the way that they win,” said Pascal. “So keep telling the stories, keep expressing yourself, and keep fighting to be who you are. And f—k the people that try to make you scared, y’know? And fight back. This is the perfect way to do so, in telling stories. And don’t let them win.” Pascal, answering another question about Latin American migrants, recounted his youth:“My parents are refugees from Chile. I myself was a refugee. We fled a dictatorship. And I was privileged enough to grow up in the US after asylum in Denmark. And if it weren’t for that, I don’t know what would have happened to us. And so I stand by those protections, always.” Another journalist went as far as to ask if there was “nothing left but civil war waiting for America.” “I don’t speak English,” Aster quipped, before eventually answering. “I think we’re on a dangerous road, and I feel like we’re living through an experiment that is going wrong – it’s gone wrong. It’s not going well and it feels like there’s no way out of it … (It) should probably be stopped or paused because it’s not working, but it’s clear that nobody’s actually interested in stopping it.” Cannes is no stranger to mixing art of politics. The seminal 1968 edition featured protests spearheaded by director Jean-Luc Godard, which forced the festival to shut down. (Time proved kind to Godard of course, who will be venerated once more at Cannes this year with Richard Linklater’s “Nouvelle Vague,” which retraces the new wave director’s efforts to get 1960 film “À Bout de Souffle” made.) The 78th edition, the first since President Donald Trump’s return to office, has already, and perhaps inevitably, kept one eye on the news. On the opening night, Robert De Niro, receiving an honorary Palme d’Or, hit out Trump, labelling him a “philistine president.” “In my country, we are fighting like hell for the democracy we once took for granted,” he told an audience made up of the great and good of the international film community.",

    "content": "After a spring of some and at the box office, summer is somehow just around the corner. With it, of course, comes a fair share of big budget popcorn flicks, as well as a collection of curious smaller movies that may just capture the cultural conversation. But the question always remains, in the post-pandemic world: what films will convince potential audiences to leave the comfort of their homes to sit in a theater for the communal experience of moviegoing? Along with the promise of cool air-conditioning, here is a list best-bets for summer theater escapes. The acclaimed director of “The Royal Tenenbaums” and “The Darjeeling Limited” is back with his next feature, again showcasing a long list of major screen stars, this time led by Benicio del Toro, Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hanks and Anderson stalwart Bill Murray. Joining them in a major role is Kate Winslet’s daughter Mia Threapleton. Expect artfully composed camera shots populated by deadpan-looking stars (see above for an example). What would the summer be without sequels? This latest entry in the storied franchise – stemming from the classic 1984 film which spawned multiple sequels as well as a popular and on Netflix – will feature ‘OG’ Karate Kid Ralph Macchio along with Jackie Chan, who fulfilled the Mr. Miyagi duties in 2010’s reboot. Also featuring up-and-comer Ben Wang. A gay couple embark on a trip to Italy ahead of becoming parents. Sounds lovely enough, until bodies start showing up. The for this black comedy romp looks engaging and fun, with “Girls” star Andrew Rannells and “Big Mouth” co-creator Nick Kroll delivering laughs like when Rannells says, about all the folks they keep accidentally killing: “This can’t be like a thing we start doing in LA.” Sure, demonic possession movies are more than a dime a dozen these days, but take one look at the cast of this one – it stars Oscar-winner Al Pacino, “Legion” and “Downton Abbey” star Dan Stevens and “Everybody Loves Raymond’s” Patricia Heaton. Also, make note of the release date of 6/6 (that’s one 6 shy of… well, you get it). From writer/director Celine Song, who brought us the Academy Award-nominated sleeper hit “ ” in 2023, “Materialists” looks like a rom-com with teeth. The film follows Dakota Johnson, playing a matchmaker in New York City, who is caught between an ex-boyfriend portrayed by Chris Evans and a handsome and rich new suitor (Pedro Pascal). After chronicling the “Days” and “Weeks” after the onset of a devastating zombie outbreak known as the Rage virus, original “28 Days Later” helmer Danny Boyle returns to direct this third installment. Get ready for more hyperrealistic ghoulish thrills, with stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer and Ralph Fiennes fighting for their lives. It might be easy to forget that “Pitch Perfect” star Rebel Wilson was in the beloved wedding-themed comedy “Bridemaids” (as one of Kristen Wiig’s super strange roommates). Now, Wilson is graduating to maid of honor status – and doubles as a lethal mercenary and spy – in this zany-looking comedy featuring her “Pitch Perfect” costar Anna Camp, along with “Veep” star Anna Chlumsky and Da’Vine Joy Randolph. Summer is for those fast-moving action-packed flicks, and this one looks like a surefire entry in that category. Brad Pitt dons a helmet as a retired Formula One driver who starts mentoring a young protégé, which means cue the moments of profound life advice intercut with eye-popping fast car footage. Also starring Javier Bardem and Damson Idris. Sequel season continues with this fourth entry in the rebooted franchise based on Steven Spielberg’s groundbreaking dino epic “Jurassic Park” from 1993 (which itself spawned two sequels – are you keeping count?). This one stars Scarlett Johansson, “Wicked” star Jonathan Bailey and two-time Oscar-winner Mahershala Ali. Oh, and a whole bevy of sharp-toothed, many-a-clawed extinct predators. This more-than-creepy looking thriller starring Danielle Deadwyler (“Till,” “The Piano Lesson”) has it all: a harrowing post-apocalyptic landscape plagued by a scarcity of resources, strong family dynamics, relevant history and a vicious band of marauding cannibals. This storied DC character is getting new life (after Henry Cavill, Brandon Routh and previously donned the red cape) in this refreshed vision from “Guardians of the Galaxy” director James Gunn. “Pearl” actor David Corenswet is our new Clark Kent/Kal-El, with Rachel “Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” Brosnahan as Lois Lane and a . (DC and Superman are properties of Warner Bros. Discovery, which also owns CNN.) Riding on the Man of Steel’s coattails is this retro foursome coming from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, in what amounts to the third major motion picture effort to bring the super-group to life (while the 2005 outing starring and Jessica Alba managed to produce a sequel two years later, the 2015 reboot was a considerable failure). Here’s hoping this one is truly fantastic. For the kids just a bit too young for the aforementioned superheroes, try these trusty blue creatures, led by Smurfette and Papa Smurf, and John Goodman, respectively. Other talent lending their pipes for the movie include Nick Offerman, Dan Levy, Natasha Lyonne, Sandra Oh, Octavia Spencer, Hanna Waddingham and Kurt Russell. And now for something completely different. “Eddington” comes from the mind of “Hereditary” and “Midsommar” director Ari Aster, which probably means this won’t be a light watch. Re-teaming with his ”Beau Is Afraid” star Joaquin Phoenix, “Eddington” tells the story of a standoff between a small-town sheriff and mayor during the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Costarring the very busy Pedro Pascal (see “Materialists” and “Fantastic Four” above, not to mention his on the latest season of “Last of Us” on the small screen). This summer chiller takes a page, again, from the “Scream” franchise by relaunching the series with a to the original, also welcoming back the stars from that first installment – none other than Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. What bad luck that this new group of youngsters (“ ” star Chase Sui Wonder among them) again seemingly run someone off the road, only to be stalked by a hook-wielding maniac. I guess we know what you did the summers of 1997 as well as 2025? For an altogether different approach to the horror genre, try this supremely uncomfortable-looking portrait of codependence starring real-life spouses Alison Brie and Dave Franco as a couple who share everything… including, apparently, their flesh, hair and body parts. Ew. Remember last summer’s “ ”? The filmmakers behind “Sketch” sure hope you don’t, as this movie about a child’s drawings coming to life is releasing almost a year to the day after that film… also about imagined drawings that become real. To its credit, “Sketch” stars versatile “Arrested Development” actor Tony Hale and “Barry,” “The Good Place” and ”Nobody Wants This” star D’Arcy Carden. This reimagining of the classic late-’80s black comedy “War of the Roses” (which starred Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas in top form) features Benedict Cumberbatch and Oscar-winner Olivia Colman as a once-loving couple who are now completely, and uproariously, at odds. Also featuring the always-welcome Allison Janney. From director Darren Aronofsky – responsible for acclaimed films like “Requiem for a Dream,” “The Whale” and “Black Swan” – this period piece features “Elvis” star Austin Butler as a washed up ex-baseball player caught up in some nefarious and criminal doings in 1990s-era New York City. Costarring Zoë Kravitz, Liev Schreiber, Vincent D’Onofrio and D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai. After the more mainstream superhero movies take their bow earlier in the season, “The Toxic Avenger” will unleash its gonzo havoc with the story of a wayward janitor played by “Game of Thrones” star Peter Dinklage who transforms into a horrific-looking good guy after an accident involving hazardous waste. The film is based on a 1984 midnight movie which commented heavily on themes of bullying and pollution.",

This new animated movie about a girl group who secretly hunts monsters brings together three somewhat disparate things into a combination that’s hard to pass up: the beguiling world of K-pop, colorful animation and supernatural demon hunters. What’s not to love? Not to be confused with this spring’s “G20,” in which Viola Davis played the POTUS going into action star mode, “Heads of State” puts forth a similar premise. John Cena and Idris Elba play world leaders who thwart a global threat alongside Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Jack Quaid and Stephen Root. Netflix’s “The Old Guard,” released way back in July 2020, was a diverting pandemic-era actioner featuring Charlize Theron as a fierce warrior fighting for good – who also just so happened to be immortal – and the young protégée (Kiki Layne) she brings under her wing. Who do they square off against in the new sequel? The inimitable “Kill Bill” star Uma Thurman.

Kermit the Frog was the commencement speaker Thursday for the Class of 2025 at the University of Maryland, where his creator, Jim Henson, was a student decades ago.

    "content": "Eight people behind the 2016 multimillion-dollar armed robbery of reality TV star in her rental apartment in were found guilty Friday, with some sentenced to prison, after a weekslong trial. The alleged ringleader of the group – nicknamed the “Grandpa robbers” for the advanced age of several of the accused – Aomar Aït Khedache was sentenced to eight years in prison, five of which were suspended. Seven of his co-defendants were also found guilty of crimes including robbery in an organized gang, kidnapping, sequestration, acquisition and possession of weapons, assisting an armed gang, aggravated theft, and complicity in preparation of a criminal act. Most of them also received prison sentences, portions of which were suspended, but all will walk free due to time already served. Two other defendants were acquitted on charges of complicity, though one was ordered to pay 5,000 euros ($5,682) to the civil parties in the trial, including Kardashian and the concierge of the rental apartment building. “The sentences are quite lenient; they were thought of a long way away from this serious event, which impacted the civil parties. You have caused harm, even if you did not strike, if blood has not been shed, you have caused fear,” said the presiding judge David De Pas as he handed down the verdict. In a statement released after the trial, Kardashian said she was “deeply grateful to the French authorities for pursuing justice in this case.” “The crime was the most terrifying experience of my life, leaving a lasting impact on me and my family. While I’ll never forget what happened, I believe in the power of growth and accountability and pray for healing for all. I remain committed to advocating for justice, and promoting a fair legal system,” Kardashian said. Her legal team said, “Kim appreciates the court’s decision and once again thanks the French authorities for treating her with great respect throughout the process. It has been a long journey from that terrible night back in 2016 to her standing courageously in a historic Paris courtroom to confront these criminals. She looks forward to putting this tragic episode behind her, as she continues working to improve the criminal justice system on behalf of victims, the innocent, and the incarcerated seeking to redeem themselves.” The lawyer for Yunice Abbas, one of the defendants who was found guilty and sentenced to seven years in prison, with five suspended, also welcomed the verdict. “It’s a very fair decision, it’s a very just decision. (Abbas) is very happy to be back with his family tonight. We’re very happy with this decision,” said the lawyer Gabriel Dumenil. Earlier in the trial, the court had heard from Kardashian that she “absolutely thought” her assailants would kill her. She also recalled fearing rape, as the men manhandled her in the robe she was sleeping in when the armed men burst in. “I have babies, I have to make it home, I have babies,” Kardashian recalled pleading with the armed men, who had broken into her hotel room while she slept during Paris Fashion Week in 2016. Kardashian was mostly calm during her testimony but was on occasions reduced to tears as she described how the burglary had upended her life and changed how she organizes her security. Of the original 12 suspects, one has since died, and another defendant who has Alzheimer’s disease has been ruled unfit to stand trial. Toward the end of Kardashian’s testimony, the presiding judge read her a letter from Khedache, the ringleader of the group, apologizing for the trauma he had inflicted. Although he was in the courtroom, the 68-year-old Khedache is partially deaf and unable to speak, his lawyer told CNN before the hearing. “I want to come to you as a human being and say how much I regret my act,” he wrote. Visibly moved, Kardashian said in her testimony she forgave him, “but it doesn’t change the emotion and the feelings and the trauma.”",

    "content": "Uche Ojeh, the husband of ‘Today’ co-host Sheinelle Jones has died following a battle with an aggressive form of brain cancer, Savannah Guthrie said Ojeh died “after a courageous battle with an aggressive form of brain cancer called glioblastoma.” He was 45. “There are no words for the pain we feel for Sheinelle and their three young children. Uche was an incredible person. We all loved him,” Guthrie said. Jones and Ojeh, who was a managing partner for UAO Consulting, met in college at Northwestern University and dated for eight years before he proposed. They married in Philadelphia, her hometown, in 2007 and are the parents of three children. Their son Kayin was born in 2009 and fraternal twins, son Uche and daughter Clara, were born in 2012. “Today” co-host Craig Melvin paid tribute to Ojeh as an exceptional father. “He loved those kids more than anything else in this world and was just so proud.

He was that guy, and they had such a beautiful love story.” Viewers of the show had noted Jones’ absence from the “Today” desk. She had been absent from the show since December. In January, she addressed her absence on social media with referencing a “family health matter.” “I sincerely appreciate all of you who have reached out while I’ve been absent from the show,” she wrote. “It’s not lost on me how lucky I am to have not only the support of my Today show family, but to also have all of you. Your kindness means so much to me. I’ll see you soon.”",

    "content": "Jamie Foxx and Eddie Murphy clearly have the type of friendship where they can be honest with each other. During a roundtable discussion with , which also included Chelsea Handler, Hasan Minhaj, Seth Meyers, Sarah Silverman and Roy Wood Jr., Foxx talked about how his professional success impacted his comedy. It came up after Meyers joked that he, too, wished he had “almost died” after seeing Foxx’s recent Netflix special, “Jamie Foxx: What Had Happened Was…” in which the Oscar-winning actor and comedian detailed his nea- death experience after suffering a stroke. “I had a special deal for a long time, but I had nothing to talk about,” Foxx said. “What was I going to talk about? I was rich. I was behind my gates.” He said he believes that his “Dreamgirls” co-star Eddie Murphy had the same issue. “I remember seeing Eddie Murphy at his house, this was around ‘Coming 2 America,’ and he says he’s going to try to go do stand-up. I say to him, ‘You can’t,’” Foxx said. “He says, ‘Why?’ I say, ‘This ain’t funny. Your house is too nice. Whatever that scent is …’ He had a scent. You know, the s**t that pumps through the house.” Foxx said he asked Murphy about the scent. “He said, ‘It’s pomegranate.’ I said, ‘The fact that you know that s**t lets me know that you ain’t funny, bro.’ It was too perfect. And that was me. I was living in that, so I didn’t have anything to talk about,” Foxx said. “Then this stroke happened, and I’m like, ‘Oh, this is a platform.’ But I don’t want to have to have another stroke, even though we have [a deal for] another hour.” As for Foxx not having another stroke because he needs comedic material, Handler quipped, “You will if you have to …”",

According to the , the condition is “a noncancerous vocal cord disorder” whose “hallmark symptoms are hoarseness and a noticeably deeper voice.” Cyrus told Zane she describes it as “abuse of the vocal cords.” “Being 21 and staying up and drinking and smoking and partying after every show does not help,” she said of her early career. “But also in my case, it does not cause it. So my voice always sounded like this — it’s a part of my unique anatomy.” The 32-year-old “Flowers” singer doesn’t want to treat it, however, for fear it will change her distinctive sound. “I have this large polyp on my cords, and I’m not willing to sever it ever, because the chance of waking up from a surgery and not sounding like myself is a probability,” she said. It can be a struggle, Cyrus said. She compared performing with the vocal polyp to “running a marathon with ankle weights on.” That also means touring can be a challenge. “I don’t lip-sync. I sing live, and these songs are big,” she said. “I don’t write little songs.”",

Those attending the club night, organized by Sugarush at Mary’s Underground, were only expecting to “come dance (or cry) in the club as DJ @xeimma plays all the eras,” as had been . But, shortly beforehand, whispers began to circulate at the venue that Lorde herself might attend because her security had done a walkthrough, Emma Parke, the DJ at the event, told CNN. Then, 20 minutes before Lorde arrived, Parke got a heads-up that she was coming, teed up all her biggest Lorde hits, and “just hope(d) for the best,” she said. The crowd had no such warning, however, and only realized the New Zealand star was there when she began interacting with some of them. Two of Parke’s friends were the first to speak to the singer as she “tapped them on the shoulder and was like ‘Oh I heard there’s a club night on tonight…,’” Parke recalled. “And then people turned their heads and started to notice. You just saw people processing it for a second, and then all of a sudden, there was this complete shift and chaos. But good chaos.” Frenzied show the Grammy-award winning singer on the dancefloor with her fans, dancing in the middle of a circle they formed around her. “So many people had their own little moment with her,” Parke said. “Her energy was just so kind and genuine … It just felt like we were all friends, and she seemed stoked to be there.” Lorde, whose real name is Ella Yelich-O’Connor, stayed around 20 minutes, at one point joining Parke on the stage where she was DJing. Then, as she turned to leave, Parke played “Girl, so confusing,” a remix track on which Lorde collaborated with Charli XCX, and “she ended up coming back into the mosh, and stuck around a little longer.” The club night had been scheduled to coincide with the release of Lorde’s latest single, “What Was That,” ahead of her new album, “Virgin,” dropping on June 27. This was the second surprise appearance Lorde has made in the run-up to her album release. In April, she danced with fans in New York’s Washington Square Park after police shut down her attempt to stage an impromptu concert.",

Mulaney appeared at the “Stories of the Season: Emmys” event hosted by in Los Angeles this week, where he was asked by Matt Belloni during a live recording of “The Town” podcast about whether he’d be interested in stepping into “SNL” creator Lorne Michaels’ shoes once he retires from the show. “If someday Lorne is hit by a bus and they say, ‘You, John Mulaney, now must take over the show, no excuses,’ what’s the first thing you change?” Belloni asked Mulaney. Mulaney replied with a masterful deflection, saying, “He’s lived in New York for 50 years, you don’t think he knows how to dodge a bus?” The comedian and talk show host worked as a writer on “SNL” between 2008 and 2012.

Michaels, 80, has run “SNL” since its inception in 1975, taking only one break as producer between 1980 and 1985.

    "content": "There was a Hollywood ending on the French Riviera on Saturday evening as Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi was awarded the Palme d’Or, top prize at the Cannes Film Festival. It’s the first time Panahi has won the festival’s highest honor, a sensational outcome after years of personal and professional adversity. The dissident director has endured multiple run-ins with the Iranian government, including imprisonment, most recently from to . The director of “No Bears,” “Taxi,” “This Is Not A Film” and more has continued to make movies, despite a ban, though he has not been able to attend the festival for over two decades. In 2010, but incarceration prevented him traveling to France. The festival kept an empty chair for him, and that year, actress . Now fifteen years later, a jury headed by Binoche awarded his film “It Was Just an Accident” the Palme. Panahi has . “It Was Just an Accident” features ex-political prisoners who kidnap a man they believe to be their former interrogator, though they are riven with doubts – and doubts about what to do with him. Elsewhere, the festival awarded “Sentimental Value” by Joachim Trier the Grand Prix (runner-up), and the Jury Prize was shared by “Sirat,” directed by Oliver Laxe, and “The Sound of Falling,” by Mascha Schilinkski. Best actor went to Wagner Moura for “The Secret Agent” by Kleber Mendonça Filho, who also won best director. Best actress was awarded to Nadia Melliti for “La Petite Dernière.” “Resurrection” by Bi Gan was awarded a Special Prize, while best screenplay was handed to Cannes stalwarts Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne for “Young Mothers.” The awards recognized plenty of films that debuted toward the tail end of the program in what turned out to be a starry but lopsided year in terms of critical acclaim. Continue on for more festival highlights from a raucous and divisive year on La Croisette. “Is this what the end of the world looks like?” a man wonders amid the bare expanse of Moroccan desert. Next to him his friend shrugs. “I think it’s been the end of the world for a long time,” he replies. Portends of doom seeped into the fabric of the Cannes Film Festival this year. An always bustling event threatened to spill over into febrile territory as an agitated world tried to make sense of the moment up on the big screen. Even the festival’s big blockbuster wasn’t immune to the mood. a continuation of 2023’s “Dead Reckoning” storyline and AI baddie, had Tom Cruise facing down nuclear Armageddon. In another year it might’ve felt like escapist fun, but the plot, inflected with paranoia between states and a collapsing world order, hit a little too close to home. More prosaic but possibly more likely was the fate of the aforementioned hippies in Oliver Laxe’s “Sirat.” They have decamped from Europe to Africa in pursuit of techno-fueled reveries, a festival in the Sahara, while the world slowly descends into global war. With them is Sergi López as a father looking for his missing daughter, with his son in tow. Together their journey into the desert plays out with “The Wages of Fear”-like peril, both tragic and thrilling. But as much as this ragtag gang might try to insulate itself from the world, reality finds cruel ways of biting back. From dancing plagues to plague itself: Laxe’s intimate view of apocalypse found an unlikely twin in Julia Ducournau’s “Alpha,” her hotly anticipated follow up to Palme d’Or winner “Titane.” Rust-colored dunes and swirling dust are present here too, albeit with a grim phantasmagoric edge. Ducournau tamps down the body horror to tell the story of Alpha, a French teenager who returns from a party one day with a stick-and-poke tattoo. This would be concerning enough for her doctor mother (Golshifteh Farahani), but it’s cataclysmic given there’s an ongoing bloodborne pandemic turning its victims to stone. The AIDS allegory is not subtle, though Ducournau’s screenplay contains more sleight of hand. Fusing past and present and increasingly focused on Alpha’s junkie uncle (a tremendous Tahar Rahim), the film’s rumination on trauma, and the resurfacing of memory when a crisis threatens to repeat itself, is thundering and desperately sad. (The AIDS crisis was also integral to Carla Simón’s auto-fictional “Romeria,” about a daughter searching for information about her dead father.) US director Ari Aster saw no need for allegory in his pandemic movie, “Eddington.” A blunt force satire – the kind that makes Ruben Ostlund look understated – Aster took aim at Covid-19, arguing it supercharged grievances in a divided nation. Set in New Mexico and starring Joaquin Phoenix as a conservative small-town sheriff squaring off with Pedro Pascal’s liberal mayor, the film takes potshots across political divides, nailing some targets better than others. Ironically, the film is so indiscriminate in its ire that commentators of all stripes have found something to back in its politics – somewhat proving the director’s point: we’re all choosing our own truths these days. , Aster was asked if all that was left for the United States was a decent into civil war. Such are the times, he gave a sincere answer, while Pascal unleashed a cri du coeur on the protection of migrants’ rights. It wasn’t the only brush with US politics: earlier in the festival, honorary Palme d’Or recipient Robert De Niro had some choice words for his regular bête noir, President Trump. and sounded off about a proposed US tariff on foreign film productions. It has been, among other things, a politically charged Cannes, even if the festival’s new guidelines prevented acts of protest extending to the red carpet, as they so often have in the past. By the festival’s midpoint, what I’d watched could’ve been labeled “bleak week,” though that’s not to say there wasn’t humor and beauty to be found among the gloom. Lynne Ramsay gave audiences both with her much-anticipated “Die, My Love,” starring Jennifer Lawrence, making her Cannes debut as an actor, and Robert Pattinson, who’s becoming a festival regular. Lawrence’s new mother Grace is anything but as an irascible New Yorker who moves to rural Montana with her son and husband Jackson, played by Robert Pattinson. Their run down home paired with her increased isolation pushes Grace into psychotic episodes at turns violent, at others funny, as she tears strips off both her husband and the furnishings. Darren Aronofsky’s “mother!” (2017) unleashed a cruel world on Lawrence’s unnamed parent, and here the actor gets to return the favor. It’s bravura stuff, perfectly matched to Ramsay’s punk sensibilities. Dark and horny and not for everyone, for those who found its wavelength “Die, My Love” was a festival highlight. MUBI is banking on it finding an audience, swooping in to buy distribution rights in . Another family drama was “The Chronology of Water,” Kristen Stewart’s feature debut as director. Her adaptation of Lidia Yuknavitch’s memoir, , was practically a wet print when it screened late on May 16. “Let’s rip off the band aid and watch this f–king movie,” Stewart told a packed house from the stage, and painful and cathartic the film proved to be. Starring Imogen Poots as a survivor of parental sexual abuse turned ascendant writer with addiction issues, Stewart matches Yuknavitch’s beat poet rhythms and keen observations with a jagged, looping timeline and some lovely image-making. Stewart seems aware of “Chronology’s” commercial limitations, but one senses it’s only a matter of time before she returns to the director’s chair. Also making a splash was “My Father’s Shadow,” the first Nigerian film in Cannes’ official selection. Set in Lagos in the wake of the turbulent 1993 general election, the movie is led by a towering Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù as a political organizer and father to two young boys, through whose eyes we see a country on the brink of change. To them, the big city is as enchanting and mysterious as their father, whose absence in their life has stung both parent and child. A tear-jerker that never feels like it’s pulling your strings, the semi-autobiographical film written by siblings Wale Davies and director Akinola Davies Jr. garnered positive reviews across the board – rare by this festival’s standards. Decidedly more upbeat was the new Wes Anderson, who applied wit and whimsy to “The Phoenician Scheme,” a pastel-hued exploration of corporate espionage. Richard Linklater directed in French for the first time with “Nouvelle Vague,” his breezy and enjoyable recreation of the making of Jean-Luc Goddard’s 1960 debut “À bout de souffle,” otherwise known as “Breathless.” Spike Lee stripped the melancholy (and the intricacies) from Akira Kurosawa’s “High To Low” in his reinterpretation casting Denzel Washington as a music mogul caught in a ransom plot gone sideways. Lee’s new joint may be uneven, but A$AP Rocky’s rapper-turned-kidnapper and Washington share some electric scenes in the home stretch worth the price of admission alone (that’s if you can see this future Apple TV+ release on a big screen). If critical consensus among the competition films was short on the ground in the first week, a swell of praise rose up in the backend for Jafar Panahi’s “It Was Just an Accident” and Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value.” Panahi’s film is about former Iranian political prisoners who kidnap their former interrogator (or have they?) and must decide what to do next. , Panahi, Iran’s most famous dissident filmmaker, said he drew on some of his own experiences as an inmate. Trier, from Norway, and coming off the back of two Oscar nominations for “The Worst Person in the World,” reunited with Renate Reinsve for a domestic drama about a vain filmmaker (Stellan Skarsgard) and his two grownup daughters with many legitimate daddy issues. Both will be distributed by Neon in the US. As bad luck would have it, when Panahi’s film screened to critics this writer was trapped on an airplane as a minor apocalypse descended upon Nice airport. Lightning lit up the airfield and rain flooded the tarmac. A different kind of show. News of Trier’s latest triumph and the 19-minute standing ovation that followed was jealously read about on social media the following day. Alas, one cannot see everything here. Kleber Mendonca Filho’s “The Secret Agent” and Mascha Schilinski’s “The Sound of Falling” both fell victim to scheduling issues. The festival is too big, the program too packed, the venture too expense. Screenings run from 8:30 a.m. until the small hours, yet there’s never enough hours in the day. Cannes is a strange beast at the best of times. On the cattle market of the red carpet, photographers scream at models and actors to get their shot, even getting physical, . But it’s also a city where the cream of world cinema can walk the streets fabulously unbothered. Lynne Ramsay can make her way through the old town area Le Suquet without a selfie request, the day after her red-hot premiere. I bumped into Japanese Palme d’Or winner Hirokazu Kore-eda twice in the space of 24 hours. At the joint afterparty for “My Father’s Shadow” and BDSM biker romance “Pillion,” Alexander Skarsgård making small talk, while Oscar-winner Daniel Kaluuya, here on jury duty, worked the dancefloor. For all its veneration of filmmakers and stars, the festival has a way of making their presence passé. Of course they’re here. Why wouldn’t they be? It’s Cannes, stupid. Now the circus has pulled down the tent for the year; the star attractions are leaving town. Cannes can resume its normal business of sun, sand and corporate events. For the film industry though, there are deals to be finalized, release dates to set, marketing campaigns and awards season strategies to be planned. All over the world wheels are in motion. The first act is done, but the show has only just begun.",

    "content": "Editor’s Note: “The Last of Us” concluded its emotional second season with a major cliffhanger. In Sunday’s action-packed Season 2 finale, a deadly reunion between Ellie (Bella Ramsey) and Abby (Kaitlyn Dever) culminated in Seattle and resulted in the shocking death of Jesse (Young Mazino) during a confrontation inside the theater. Here’s how it played out: After a tense exchange with Jesse, he and Ellie split up. Ellie went to find a boat to get herself to the aquarium, where she believed Abby was hiding. Jesse, meanwhile, trucked on to find Tommy (Gabriel Luna), which was their original mission. Ellie eventually made it to the aquarium – after a stressful close encounter with some Seraphites – and found Abby’s friends Owen (Spencer Lord) and Mel (Ariela Barer), both of whom were there when Abby killed Joel (Pedro Pascal) earlier this season. When they refused to tell Ellie where Abby was, Ellie shot Owen through the neck, grazing Mel in the process. What she hadn’t known until Mel was injured was that Mel was pregnant. With her last breaths, Mel begged Ellie to cut out her baby, but, clearly affected by the reality of Dina’s (Isabela Merced) ongoing pregnancy, Ellie could not do it. Jesse and Tommy eventually found Ellie crying over Mel’s body. Back at the theater, Ellie, Tommy and Jesse were plotting their route home and Tommy tried to comfort Ellie about killing Mel and Owen to no avail. Ellie was upset that Abby got to live. Moments after Tommy left the theater to start packing, Ellie and Jesse heard a commotion in the lobby. As they burst through the doors, Jesse got shot square in the face and Ellie hid behind a bar. Abby stood over Tommy, holding him at gunpoint, when Ellie revealed herself and asked Abby to “let him go.” Ellie told Abby that she was the one who killed her friends because “I was looking for you… I didn’t mean to hurt them.” “I let you live and you wasted it,” Abby said to Ellie. The screen went black as Abby raised her gun up to Ellie and a gunshot rang out, the victim – or whether there is one at all – left unknown. In the next scene, Abby is woken up by Manny, the timeline of when this interaction is taking place unclear. The episode ends with Abby walking out onto a balcony that overlooks a stadium in Seattle that appears to show a flourishing farm base. “Seattle day one,” text across the screen read just before the end credits rolled. Executive producers Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann spoke at press conference with several media outlets, who were provided a screener of the finale, ahead of the episode’s airing. They teased that in Season 3, like the video game on which the show is based, Abby’s perspective will be bolstered and make viewers question if she really is a villain. They also said that moving forward, the central relationship in the show will naturally shift from Joel and Ellie to Dina and Ellie, which could mean the finale confrontation has a less grim conclusion than what some might fear. Or they’re toying with us all. Time will tell. Here’s what else happened in the finale:",

But for its simple charms, it can provoke some remarkably deep revelations — exchanging memories surrounding the videos is how we learn each other’s lore. “You’re saying something about your inner life, your story,” said Clay Routledge, a psychologist who studies nostalgia at the Archbridge Institute think tank. “You don’t normally think that watching music videos might do that.” Lakyn Carlton, a stylist and social media personality, perhaps it best: “Watching music videos is a perfectly valid and, in fact, validly perfect party activity.” Some of my fondest memories revolve around music videos: Watching Duran Duran’s “Rio” with my mom to better understand her teenage crush on Nick Rhodes. Returning home late with my college roommates, falling asleep to Shakira and Ciara. Waking up early before middle school with VH1’s “Jump Start,” trying to learn the words to the Rihanna and Taylor Swift songs my classmates were singing. Filming our videos as kids with our parents’ bulky handheld cameras. “Music is a powerful source of nostalgia, and we all have soundtracks to our lives,” Routledge said. “So when we hear old music, with memories attached to it, it does bring us back. It helps us make good contact with nostalgic memories.” The ritual of music video marathons began for most in 1981, with the birth of MTV, where you could reliably catch instant classics like ,” indie breakthroughs like the Talking Heads’ “Burning Down the House” and Dire Straits’ meta “Money for Nothing,” imagining a conversation between people who jealously fantasize about living like the artists they watch on (where else?) MTV. “Many a life-altering youth experience revolved around an MTV soundtrack,” Jamie Allen for CNN in 2001, 20 years after the network launched. The music on MTV was kaleidoscopic, even if it took the network several years to integrate videos from genres pioneered by Black artists. And it “managed to bring together people” whose tastes may never have overlapped on the radio, Syracuse University now-trustee professor Robert Thompson told CNN in 2001. When MTV pivoted to reality programming full-time, music videos , where many of them have since racked up billions of views, even if they premiered on cable. And that’s where many younger Millennials and Gen Z music lovers first fell in love with the artform. “People might think pop culture is kind of superficial, but oftentimes, it tells the story of a time — the story of a time we were a part of and connected to,” Routledge said. Nostalgia, Routledge said, very often turns contagious. Once someone starts dreamily revisiting a teenage episode of their lives, even if the disclosure is inspired by Britney Spears’ airplane-set “Toxic” video, it opens the door to get to know them better — and for the rest of the attendees of a music video night to share their own stories. “People kind of think of nostalgia as this personal experience, but so much of nostalgia is an exchange with other people,” Routledge said. “‘I remember where I was, here’s my story’ — there’s self-disclosure there. We’re building the closeness of our relationships because we’re revealing more about our personal lives.” Victoria Arguelles, a content strategist at an ad agency, recently moved back to her hometown of Miami. But she treasures the nights in New York when she and her friends would meet up for “Frigay,” their name for the standing appointment of watching older music videos before hitting the town. “It unlocked a ton of memories,” she said of the weekly tradition. Whether spinning in circles to Madonna’s “Ray of Light” or shocking themselves by discovering the moves to Lady Gaga’s “Judas” still lived in their bodies, Arguelles and her friends strengthened their bonds through song and dance. They’d often continue the music video marathon once they returned home from the bar, sometimes into the early morning. “Everyone had different memories attached, but we all somehow knew the same choreography,” Arguelles said. “So our friend group was very much the meme of because we do!” My first music video request is always Lady Gaga’s “Telephone,” because every time it plays, I’m suddenly 12 again, lying on my stomach on the carpet of my friend Katie’s living room, noodling around on her laptop when we first watch the video that blows our minds. We were hanging out in between school and rehearsal, in the time of our lives before we rebuilt our identities as teenagers. We were energized by Gaga’s anarchic vision of a Bonnie-and-Clyde romance with Beyoncé. Watching the “Telephone” video’s near-nudity, f-bombs and lesbian love affair felt like a portal to a more adult world. Most of my friends have similar stories about music videos stirring something in them, or symbolizing a time in their lives they never thought they’d miss. And without music video nights, we wouldn’t have such a convenient occasion on which to share those stories. So I asked my friends about some of their most treasured nights spent with music videos. Logan remembered discovering Billie Eilish from her college apartment couch. Elly said she and her friends still turn pretty much every girls’ night into a music video marathon, touching everything from A$AP Rocky to early 2010s J-pop to . Hellen recently revisited Vanessa Hudgens’ videos that used to play during Disney Channel commercial breaks and filmed herself relearning the choreography. Lexi carefully curates hers with Janet Jackson, Mandy Moore and Mariah Carey, comparing her playlists to a “karaoke night but for free” and with “no limit on how much time you have.” More than a few of my friends told me they started the music video nights with the intention of venturing out late, but they ended up staying in and singing together instead. There’s an emphasis on videos that are 10, 20, even 40 years older on music video nights mostly because they’re part of the pop cultural language we share with our friends, but also because artists just aren’t cranking out classic videos like they used to. Still, there’s Sabrina Carpenter’s gory, sapphic video for her hit “Taste,” and Chappell Roan’s clips have a scrappy DIY charm. And of course, video queen Gaga has wormed her way back into my rotation with “ .” That video feels like it’s nostalgic, too, for the era of Gaga’s career when dark, dance-y videos for “Telephone,” “Bad Romance” and “Alejandro” were viral hits. So when “Abracadabra” comes on now, it takes me back to that time. “There are a lot of things that we do on the surface that just seem kind of fun or superficial or not really that meaningful,” Routledge said. But popular cultural artifacts, including the music videos we obsessed over as kids, give us a “reason to talk about something.” “You end up sharing what you were feeling at the time,” Routledge said. “It’s going beyond the superficial conversation to sharing things. And nostalgia helps us do that, because, in a way, that makes us feel connected to these memories. And then you’re revealing something, right?”",

    "content": "Billie Eilish was a big winner at Monday night’s . Eilish wasn’t present at the show since she is currently on tour, but she won all seven awards that she was nominated for, including artist of the year, album of the year and song of the year. Beyoncé won two AMAs for favorite female country artist and favorite country album,  marking the first time she was recognized in the country music category. Other winners included Kendrick Lamar, who earned one AMA for favorite hip-hop song for “Not Like Us,” and SZA, who took home two awards for favorite R&B song and favorite female R&B artist. Host Jennifer Lopez opened the show with an energetic dance number to a medley that included a mashup of songs by Beyoncé, Eilish, Shaboozey, Chappell Roan and more. Janet Jackson received the 2025 Icon award and made her first TV performance in seven years, performing songs including “Someone to Call My Lover” and “All for You.” “My family (and) myself, our dream wasn’t ever to be famous. We weren’t raised like that. We always had a special love for music, dancing and singing, and fame came with the result of hard work and dedication,” Jackson said while accepting her award. “My story, my family’s story, it’s truly an American story. This would’ve only happened in America.” Sir Rod Stewart was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award and closed out the show with a performance of “Forever Young.” Blake Shelton, Benson Boone, Gloria Estefan, Lainey Wilson, Gwen Stefani and Reneé Rapp, among others, also performed during the telecast.

    "title": "\n      Mondo Duplantis aims for ‘dominance’ in ‘freaky sport’ of pole vault after breaking the world record multiple times\n    ",
    "author": "George Ramsay, Amanda Davies, Aleks Klosok",
    "publication_date": "2024-04-11T08:32:54.026Z",

    "content": "Few athletes can claim to be as dominant in their discipline as , the star who has broken the world record a staggering seven times. His latest record of 6.23 meters, achieved at last year’s world championships, is seven centimeters higher than anyone else has managed in the history of the sport, a testament to his supremacy in the pole vault over the past four years. Duplantis’ medal haul is also impressive, boasting an gold and four world championship titles – two indoor and two outdoor – with his sights set on further Olympic success in Paris later this year. And as for world records, Duplantis promises that he’s not done yet. “I think in the near future, I hope to just raise it up as little as I can because I think that’s all I need to do for a world record,” he tells Amanda Davies. “I know that I can jump higher. I know that I have higher heights in me. “I know what I need to do to get into those 6.30-type marks … I want to be dominant in the sport because I know that’s what I’m capable of, trying to win every competition and get the most out of myself at every meet that I’m at. “If I’m able to jump high, jump a world record, then that’s just a cherry on top.” Sporting pedigree runs in the Duplantis family: his father was a former top pole vaulter and his mother a heptathlete who competed for Sweden. He has been pole vaulting for almost as long as he could walk, taking his first steps in the sport as a three-year-old in his parents’ backyard in Lafayette, Louisiana, where a runway, bar and crash mat were installed for him and his siblings to use. While most athletes would take up the sport in their teenage years, it has been a lifelong affair for Duplantis, his childhood hobby gradually morphing into a successful career. He will never tire, he explains, of the feeling of climbing into the air, bending his body over a bar and falling back down to earth. “It’s special, and I think that it’s so hard to compare to most things,” he says. “But when you get it right, it’s like you’re kind of doing this little dance with the pole. “It happens fast. I feel like when I’m on my game and I’m dialed in and everything’s in the place where it needs to be then it’s super cool. It’s like riding a wave.” One of the more technical events in track and field, pole vault requires a unique blend of speed, strength and flexibility, though the mental aspect, says Duplantis, is just as important as the physical demands. “You have to be a little bit – or quite a bit – crazy to be able to dare to pole vault because it is a little bit of a freaky sport, in a way,” he explains. “You have to have the guts to be able to push yourself, and you’re going to be uncomfortable a lot of the time when you’re going up to stiffer poles, longer poles, trying new heights, new barriers all the time.” Born and raised in Louisiana, Duplantis has dual Swedish and American citizenship but competes for his mother’s native country on the international circuit. He is the strong favorite to defend his gold medal at the Paris Olympics, which officially begin on July 26, but had to work hard to win a second indoor world title last month after failing twice at 5.85m – a height he would usually expect to clear with ease. In the end, he managed to record a world-leading 6.05m, 15 centimeters higher than American Sam Kendricks in second and 20 clear of Greece’s Emmanouil Karalis in third. Duplantis later admitted that it was the hardest he had ever had to work in a competition, though he will be hoping that his events are more smooth-sailing as he embarks on the outdoor season with the Olympics looming. But when things don’t go as planned, Duplantis would do well to remind himself of his long history with the pole vault, even though the stakes are now higher and the audiences are much bigger than when he first took up the sport. “It’s still the same old pole vault,” he says. “The same event I’ve been doing since I was just a tiny little kid jumping in my backyard. I’m getting better as the year goes on which is a really cool thing. I’m definitely living my dream.”",

    "title": "\n      Excluded from the Olympics for his whole career, artistic swimmer Bill May set for ‘beautiful’ debut at this year’s Games\n    ",

    "content": "For decades, Bill May has dreamed of competing at the . It’s not athletic ability which has prevented him from achieving that goal to date, but a far more fundamental issue: he’s a man. Until recently, male have been excluded from competing at the Olympics, though a rule change announced just over a year ago means that May, a 45-year-old veteran of the sport, can finally fulfill his lifelong ambition. “There is nothing in the world that could ever be bad right now,” he tells , understandably elated after the USA’s qualification for this year’s Games in Paris. “Everything is beautiful, amazing, wonderful. We’re going to the Olympics.” Few athletes will be more deserving of their place at this year’s Games, which get underway in July, than May, and few will have had such an onerous, circuitous path to get there. Precisely 20 years ago, with men still banned from artistic swimming, May watched from the side of the pool as the US team won bronze in Athens. He stepped away from the sport after that, joining the Cirque du Soleil in its water production, “O.” That was his life for the next 10 years, at least until his competitive career was handed a lifeline. When male athletes were granted permission to compete at the world championships in 2015, May once again found himself switching lanes. He became the inaugural winner of the mixed duet technical event alongside Christina Jones that year, and is now, finally, set to compete at the pinnacle of his sport. In December 2022, World Aquatics announced that up to two male artistic swimmers from the teams of eight would be able to compete at the Paris Olympics. “This is something that I’ve dreamed of my whole life,” says May. “This is that one more thing to add to my list of dreams that continue to come true. “I feel like my life is a cliché. This sport has given me so much, and now – to have the absolute dream of going to the Olympic Games – this is something that no one in the world could ever pass up, even just to try.” Artistic swimming, known as synchronized swimming before a name change in 2017, has a long and complicated history when it comes to male participation in the sport. Popularized in the United States in the first half of the 20th century, men were an established part of artistic swimming’s formative years. However, male competitors were later seen to be at odds with the sport due to certain physical characteristics: they were heavier, less flexible – finding leg extensions more difficult – and less buoyant than their female counterparts. “We are used to seeing a sport with a lot of grace, a lot of elegance, and there is also a big choreographic component,” Italian artistic swimmer Nicolò Ogliari in 2021. “It’s a dance in the water. Maybe, we are more used to seeing a woman do these things. But like in classic dance, also in artistic swimming, there are men.” When artistic swimming was first added to the Olympics in 1984, only women were allowed to compete. It has remained that way for the past 40 years, but this year’s competition will mark a seismic moment in the sport’s history. “This is something that comes from our heart, not that comes from a gender,” says May. “I can never rationalize why anyone would keep anyone out. “For one, it keeps the sport from growing. And two, it’s just not fair. It doesn’t represent humanity. It’s not the way that we want to represent sports in our culture.” May, who will focus on his coaching career after this year’s Games, has been described as a “God” of the sport by fellow competitor Giorgio Minisini. The New York native has been involved in artistic swimming since the age of 10, when, after persuasion from his mom, he ended up joining his sister’s classes. He later moved to California, but despite winning a series of national titles, his career was restricted by the lack of opportunities for men at the highest level. Today, May is in the pool between eight and 10 hours each day as he prepares for the Olympics, on top of cross-training, core exercises, flexibility and weight training. In his mind, artistic swimming is one of, if not the most physically demanding sport on the Olympic program. “You have to move like a dancer,” he says. “You have to tumble and include acrobatics like a gymnast or an acrobat; you have to have the endurance of a marathon runner, and you have to do all of these things without breathing and without touching the bottom. “There’s not one sport in the world where you cannot breathe while you do your entire event, along with everything else combined. I really do think that it’s one of the most difficult sports in the world.” A new event – an acrobatic routine – has been added to this year’s artistic swimming program, alongside technical and free routines. Athletes will compete as a team or a duet, with a total of six medals up for grabs. “I feel that we’re going in with the greatest team in the world – the team that works the hardest, the team that has the most drive and determination,” May says about the USA’s chances at this year’s Olympics, having secured a place at the Games via this month’s world championships. “I think the opportunity to get a medal is really strong.” Denied a spot at the Olympics for so long, May harbors no sense of bitterness or regret about male exclusion from artistic swimming events, only gratitude for being able to finish his competitive career on such a spectacular high. “I know that this sport has given me a life beyond anything I could ever imagine,” he says.",

    "title": "\n      ‘Breaking has total freedom for me,’ says Menno van Gorp, a medal hopeful in the newest Olympic sport\n    ",

    "cate": "sport",
    "content": "To the tune of a Miles Davis trumpet solo, Menno van Gorp is stepping up his training ahead of this year’s . The jazz musician has been an influential figure in van Gorp’s career, his smooth sound and freewheeling rhythms a constant source of inspiration for each new routine. “I love to practice on jazz,” van Gorp tells . “It gives me more freedom and it just triggers more creativity when I move to jazz. Also, the part of improvisation in jazz is huge. I think that really reflects well with breaking.” The 35-year-old van Gorp, a competitive b-boy from the Netherlands known simply as Menno, is a medal hopeful at the upcoming Olympics, where breakdance – or breaking – will make its debut as the Games’ newest sport. Suddenly seeing their discipline labeled as a sport isn’t something that necessarily sits comfortably with b-boys and b-girls – the name given to men and women who compete in breaking. It has some similarities with pre-existing Olympic events like martial arts, gymnastics, and skateboarding, but will also bring its own subversive identity to this year’s Games. “We’re under the flag of sports now, but to me, it’s still also an art,” says van Gorp, who calls himself an “artlete” on social media. “I think breaking is so unique that it’s impossible to put it in one box … It’s many things together, and it’s also an expression.” A high-scoring breakdance routine requires a unique blend of strength, stamina, agility, and flexibility, as well as the mental wherewithal to ensure that moves aren’t repeated and flow seamlessly into each other. “You use literally every part of your body,” says van Gorp, “including your ears and your brains and your heart and your toes and your heels … I use my fingertips; I use the point of my elbow – every part in your body that you can use. “It takes a lot of physical abilities, I think, to be a good breaker.” Van Gorp practiced judo before he took up breaking, which found a foothold in his hometown of Tilburg during the 1990s. “First everybody was collecting Pokémon cards, then everybody was yo-yoing,” he says. “Suddenly, everybody started breaking.” After eight years of judo, he had started to find the sport too restrictive, the scope for creativity too narrow. “Breaking gave me so much freedom compared to judo,” van Gorp adds. “Breaking has total freedom for me, so that’s why I really liked it. In other sports, you’re always limited by a lot of rules.” Originating in New York in the late 1960s, breaking has since gained global popularity and today is synonymous with a specific subgenre of street style – sneakers, sweatpants, and baseball caps worn at an angle. Van Gorp, like many kids discovering breakdance for the first time in the early 2000s, gained insight from watching grainy videos and talking through routines with his friends before joining practices around the Netherlands and overseas. It was in winning the UK championships in 2007 that van Gorp says he “exploded onto the scene” and started to compete more regularly. He has gone on to win titles all over the world, including at the 2019 WDSF World Breaking Championship and three victories at the BC One World Finals – a feat only matched by South Korean b-boy Hong 10. Breaking is the first World DanceSport Federation (WDSF) event to be added to the Olympic program, and in Paris, 16 b-boys and 16 b-girls will face off in one-on-one battles set against a DJ’s hip-hop soundtrack. They take it in turns to perform a routine and are scored by a panel of judges based on six criteria: creativity, personality, technique, performativity, variety, and musicality. With the Olympics in mind, van Gorp is breaking for up to two and a half hours each day, plus gym sessions and calisthenics – body-weight strength training like push-ups and sit-ups – in pursuit of winning gold. Such an accolade, he says, would be a huge boost for his profile. “I’m building here a dance studio in Rotterdam and I’m working also on the new generation here,” van Gorp explains. “Getting a medal I think would be so helpful for my career after breaking to make stuff happen for the next generation – that type of stamp on your name.” On top of establishing his dance school, van Gorp is also an amateur photographer; he paints – typically large canvasses streaked in brightly-colored lines – has his own clothes brand and is a father of two. His life, therefore, is a juggling act while training for the Olympics, which is all-consuming at the moment. In order to qualify for the Games, van Gorp will hope to earn selection via the in May and June. Like every breaking competition, that will test not only his movement and creativity in the heat of a battle but also his memory: originality is rewarded, and contestants are scored down for repeating moves between rounds. “It all comes down to preparation,” says van Gorp. “I study my material a lot. I’ve found memory hacks to remember my stuff, so I give names to my moves. I make rhymes, I connect them with moments in life. I connect them with music I like. “And I write stuff down, I try it, I read it back, I visualize, and you pick between competitions what material you have left. And then in the battle it should all just fall in place.” Van Gorp compares himself to a “cage fighter” in the middle of a battle – “I really need to have that fire … it’s not about being a nice guy anymore,” he says – and believes that he thrives on being spontaneous and unpredictable during competitions. “A lot of unexpected movements, a lot of creativity,” he identifies as features of his routines. “My style is definitely based on flow and transitions, and I think you need to have a very well-trained eye to understand what I’m really doing. “If you blink one time or if you look away, you might have missed an important detail.” Having a unique style can be key in breaking, as it is with any form of art or music. It’s something that has drawn van Gorp to Miles Davis in particular. “To see how many times he reinvented himself and he still stayed authentic to himself, that’s a huge inspiration for me,” he says. Few other, if any, athletes will be honing their craft to the emotive sounds of jazz music ahead of this year’s Olympics, but that’s part of what makes breaking such an intriguing addition. “If you want to make art,” says van Gorp, “you want to make something that’s really you – not somebody else.”",

    "content": "In a line-up of India’s sporting heroes, most of whom have gained celebrity status through , Neeraj Chopra is an anomaly. In fact, the champion javelin thrower has barely bowled a ball or swung a bat since his childhood, even though he can’t help but notice the similarities between his discipline and his country’s favorite past-time. “I feel that in India, it’s natural, a fast arm,” Chopra tells . “And it’s a basic thing in javelin throwing – if you have a fast arm, you can throw far.” The South Asian country is home to more than 125 million cricket fans, according to a 2022 by Ormax Media, but Chopra’s ability to hurl a javelin close to 300 feet has earned him a sizeable following in his own right. His stardom has only grown with each passing success. After winning gold in Tokyo three years ago – the first Asian athlete to do so in the javelin – Chopra was crowned world champion in Budapest last year, becoming the first Indian to win a world title in a track and field event of any kind. It perhaps comes as no surprise, given his historic career to date, that the understated 26-year-old has proven a hit back home. “So many people from my country, they support me, they watch my competitions,” says Chopra. “Even if I’m competing in the Diamond League, they stay awake until one or two at night and they watch my competition. It’s really amazing that people support athletics.” Such is his popularity that August 7 is now celebrated as National Javelin Day in India, the anniversary of Chopra winning his Olympic gold medal in Tokyo. Prior to Chopra, India had practically no history in track and field, winning most of its Olympic medals in field hockey and wrestling. But now there is genuine excitement each time the superstar athlete competes, and as he jockeys up a runway with a quivering javelin in hand, a nation holds its breath. “You ask anybody in India who their favorite sportsperson is at the moment, unanimously the answer will be Neeraj Chopra – despite the fact that athletics is not a popular sport,” veteran journalist Norris Pritam, who last year published a on Chopra’s life and career, tells CNN Sport. “On the other hand, cricket is a popular sport, a common man’s sport. People talk, breathe, eat cricket, it’s kind of a religion. But still, Neeraj Chopra is the best sportsperson. He’s a hero. He’s absolutely a hero in India.” Growing up in the rural village of Khandra in the northern state of Haryana, Chopra played cricket and volleyball – another sport in which a fast arm can be a useful weapon – in his pre-teen years. He was overweight as a child – carrying what he has as “excess flab” – and was frequently told that sport wasn’t for him. But that all changed as soon as he caught sight of a javelin shimmering through the sky at an athletics stadium in the nearby city of Panipat. “It was a very random thing for me because there was no background in my family or my whole village – nobody was an athlete, nobody knows about javelin throwing,” says Chopra. “When I go to the stadium … I really like how the javelin flies and how it’s going like fish swimming in the sea. I really like this thing, and even now when I throw, I always enjoy how the javelin flies.” This was in 2011, and it was enough for the then-13-year-old Chopra to be inspired to try the sport for himself. His father and uncles, part of a family of farmers, pooled together enough money to buy a steel javelin, and it was in a plowing field near the family home that Chopra attempted some of his first throws. A seed was soon sown, and the fledgling athlete would spend hour after hour launching throw after throw. “He started without any training, without any family background, without any sort of formal school where there could be a javelin thrower,” says Pritam. “In fact, the school in the village had no culture for sport, no grounds for sport.” Before he had any proper coaching, Chopra relied on YouTube videos to hone his technique. His talent soon became evident, and after moving to a sports academy in the city of Panchkula, his arm speed got faster, his throws further, and international competitions quickly followed. Today, Chopra’s resumé is long and impressive, boasting two Asian Games titles and a Commonwealth Games gold medal on top of his world and Olympic triumphs. He is the favorite to defend his title at the Paris Olympics, which get underway on July 26, though he’s not allowing thoughts of further success to enter his head at this stage. “My main focus is to stay healthy,” says Chopra, “but I’m not taking the pressure of winning a gold medal again. I’ll just do my training with 100% of my heart and I’ll give my best … That day will decide who will win a medal.” Performing under pressure, particularly with such a huge fanbase back home in India, has been a common theme of Chopra’s career. His popularity doesn’t faze him, instead feeding his self-belief right down to his final throw. “This is not pressure for me,” he adds. “I feel really good when people are talking about me and they say, ‘Okay, Neeraj can win this medal, Neeraj can throw far.’ I always take these things positively.” Having won his first world title – previously, the most obvious gap in his trophy cabinet – last year, Chopra now wants to throw beyond 90 meters (about 295 feet), which he describes as a “magical mark” in javelin throwing. Only 24 men in history have ever thrown further than 90 meters, but Chopra’s personal best is only six centimeters (about 2.4 inches) shy of that distance; it is more a matter of when, rather than if, he can tick off that goal. In India, however, he has nothing more to prove, his status as a national hero already secured. “Everybody knows Neeraj,” says Pritam, “because his posters are there, his billboards are there, he’s in books and magazines and everything. “You put on the TV and you find Neeraj there talking; he’s a brand ambassador to hundreds of things – sanitation, education, selling products on television. He is a moving billboard, one can say now.” And if he wins a second gold medal at the Olympics? “He will be treated like God,” adds Pritam. Chopra, rarely overwhelmed by such adulation, is taking public recognition in his stride. He nearly always trains and competes outside of India, but when he is back home, he is often struck by his far-reaching influence. “When people meet me, they always say, ‘Our son or our daughter will also start javelin or athletics, and they can also win a medal for India,’” says Chopra. “This is a good thing for me.”",

    "content": "At some point last year, Yaroslava Mahuchikh vowed to stop reading the news before competitions, so distressing did she find the stories and images of bloodshed in her native Ukraine. One of the world’s top high jumpers, Mahuchikh knew that absolute concentration was required to perfectly execute her run-up, take-off and back-arching leap, but still her mind would gravitate towards the difficult situation thousands of miles away back home. Perhaps that’s only natural when your country is at war and fresh missile attacks are being launched on a regular basis – some even directed at blocks in your hometown. “It’s challenging for me to compete after reading the news of rockets sent to civilians,” Mahuchikh tells . “I’m thinking about how many people died, how many peoples’ houses were destroyed. It’s difficult.” That strategy – of trying to shut out Russia’s invasion of Ukraine before she competes – proved effective last year. Mahuchikh won her first world championship title in August, then successfully defended her Diamond League Final victory in September. Understandably, her confidence is now high for the months ahead. That includes the Millrose Games in New York this weekend, the world indoor championships in Glasgow in March and then the in July and August. She’s unsure if she will return to Ukraine in that time having moved between various training bases around Europe for most of the past two years. Because of the war, itinerancy has become a common theme in her life. “I live in a suitcase, really,” says Mahuchikh, “because with traveling, we don’t have a hometown.” Her family – her mother and sister – have sometimes joined the 22-year-old while she is on the road, but her father, like many Ukrainians, has stayed at home in Dnipro. That’s often a source of anxiety for Mahuchikh, especially when Russian attacks target the eastern city. “My father, he said that, unfortunately, for a lot of people, it’s life right now, we live in this way,” she explains. “And they continue their life. My father sometimes says, ‘Oh, you know, if the rockets come, it’s okay, it’s my life, maybe it’s God saying that it’s finished.’ And I say, ‘Oh my gosh, father, please – go to the basement.’” Dnipro has absorbed several deadly missile attacks throughout the invasion, with the Russian military targeting and in the city. In August last year, Ukraine’s War Crimes Department in the Prosecutor General’s Office that approximately 10,749 civilians had been killed during the war and 15,599 wounded. Yet even as fighting rages on, Mahuchikh still longs for the familiarity of being back home with her family and friends. “If I was not an athlete at international level, I think I would be in Ukraine,” she says. “But I have some goals and I’m competing for my country. I represent Ukraine at competitions; it’s my goal and it’s my mission, I think.” Russia’s invasion has invigorated Mahuchikh’s sense of national pride. She wore blue and yellow eye shadow – the colors of the Ukrainian flag – at last year’s world championships and is supporting to send wheelchairs to disabled orphans in Ukraine. She also hopes that competing at high-profile events and winning gold medals will provide her with a platform from which to highlight her country’s plight. “I feel that I am an ambassador of Ukraine and I have this possibility to involve a lot of people in this problem that Ukrainian people now have,” says Mahuchikh. “A lot of families are under rocket attack; a lot of children, unfortunately, lost their parents or parents lost their children. It’s so sad, and it’s so sad that a lot of athletes and coaches died in this war. But I want to help my country. It’s the main goal.” According to Vadim Guttsait, Ukraine’s sports minister and president of its National Olympic Committee (NOC), have been killed since the start of the war. This year’s Olympics, Mahuchikh believes, will enable Ukrainian athletes to promote a message of peace, though perhaps inevitably, the Games have also become entwined in geopolitics. In particular, the question of whether athletes from Russia and , a key military launchpad during the war in Ukraine, will be able to compete has become a flashpoint. In December, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) that athletes from those two countries will be able to take part as neutrals in Paris, so long as they meet certain eligibility criteria. For example, only individual athletes, rather than teams, will be included in the Games, and athletes who actively support the war or who are contracted to their country’s military services will be ineligible. However, international federations have the first say on whether Russian and Belarusian athletes can qualify for the Olympics. , the governing body of track and field, has Russian and Belarusians from events “for the foreseeable future,” meaning they will be unable to compete in track and field events in Paris as things stand. It’s a contentious topic: some, like the IOC’s executive board, believe that individual athletes shouldn’t be stopped from competing on the basis of their passport, while others, namely a campaign group representing Ukrainian athletes, argue that Russian participation of any kind only strengthens the country’s “propaganda machine.” Mahuchikh welcomes World Athletics’ stance, believing that neutral flags are an ineffective way of concealing an athlete’s national identity. “When I see Russian athletes … I see every city destroyed, every life that was destroyed by Russian people, by the Russian Federation,” she says, adding that she would find it “difficult” to compete against athletes from Russia and Belarus. Last month, more than 200 sportspeople from Ukraine wrote a to French President Emmanuel Macron, urging Russians and Belarusians to be banned from competing at the Games. However, neither local organizers nor the French government have jurisdiction over who qualifies for the Olympics, and Paris 2024 organizers have underlined that this responsibility lies with the IOC and international federations. Guttsait has previously suggested that Ukraine could the Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete, though a final decision is yet to be made. Mahuchikh is against such a move, instead believing that the Olympics should represent “peace in all the world.” A bronze medalist in Tokyo three years ago, she is also one of Ukraine’s biggest stars in Paris, aiming to win what would be her country’s first gold medal in the high jump. “Every athlete wants to compete, every athlete wants to win the gold medal,” says Mahuchikh. “Of course, I have goals for winning, and I want to have this medal in my sports career.” She has tweaked her technique ahead of the upcoming indoor season, shortening her run-up to compensate for her increased speed as she approaches the bar. Having made her season debut in Cottbus, Germany, last weekend – finishing first after clearing a world-leading height of two meters and four centimeters (about 6.69 feet) – the new technique will be put to the test again at the Millrose Games. This is where Mahuchikh’s immediate focus lies, but in the long term, she has loftier ambitions for her career – namely Stefka Kostadinova’s world record of two meters and nine centimeters (about 6.86 feet). The Bulgarian’s mark has stood since 1987, making it one of the longest-standing world records in track and field. Mahuchikh has watched the likes of and – both, like her, sponsored by Puma – set records in the 400-meter hurdles and the pole vault respectively, and now she hopes to join the club. “I believe that one day I will jump 2.10,” she says. “I want to be part of this family of world record holders.”",

    "title": "\n      ‘The eyes of the world are on this race’. Paris Olympics’ triathlon hangs in the balance over E. Coli levels in the Seine\n    ",
    "author": "Billy Stockwell",
    "publication_date": "2024-06-18T08:00:16.040Z",

    "content": "A reference point for Parisians and tourists alike, the River Seine will be the crown jewel of the Olympics this summer, staging events such as the as well as the opening ceremony, which will not be taking place in a stadium. Starting at Pont Alexandre III Bridge, the individual triathlon races are with a 1.5-kilometer swim, followed by a 40K bike race – passing by the Le Grand Palais and Champs-Elysées – before finishing with a 10K run through the heart of the city. A mixed team relay race involving four athletes – two men and two women – will also start at Pont Alexandre III Bridge with each team member completing a 300-meter swim, followed by a 5.8K bike ride and 1.8K run. If all goes to plan, it will be a historic moment, given that swimming in the Seine has been illegal for more than 100 years , though some swimming has been permitted recently as part of triathlon test events. But some are warning that there are still potential dangers lurking below the river’s shimmery surface. Recent testing results shared with CNN by technology company Fluidion show that the Seine is still not safe for swimming as per the standards set by World Triathlon, due to high bacteria levels in the water, potentially exposing athletes to serious health risks. Authorities have ($1.55 billion) to clean up the Seine. Last month, a rainwater storage facility was opened that can hold 20 Olympic swimming pools worth of water to reduce pressure on the sewage network and lower the risk of wastewater being discharged into the Seine, according to a statement from Paris 2024. Meanwhile, triathlon teams around the world are preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. “For me, it will be very frustrating and very shaming for France, Paris and the Olympics if we can’t do a triathlon,” French-born triathlete Jeanne Lehair told CNN in a telephone interview. The city of Paris is working with its own laboratory to monitor the Olympic Seine site, but technology company Fluidion, founded in Paris in 2012, has also been checking the water quality of the river several times a week at Pont Alexandre III Bridge. The Seine serves as Fluidion’s primary research site, according to the company, hence why they routinely collect water samples for internal research efforts. CNN has not independently verified the organization’s findings. Fluidion’s testing has found that, on average, levels in the Siene between early April and late May were just under 3400 MPN/100mL. According to CNN’s calculation, this is more than three times higher than the level needed for “good” water quality, as per World Triathlon . “We have experienced a very rainy past couple of months, causing numerous combined sewer overflows in Paris and upstream,” Dan Angelescu, CEO of Fluidion, told CNN on May 31 via email, adding that the impact on water quality is evident, with “noticeable bacterial spikes following storm events.” Nearly all of France has seen 120 to 200% of normal rainfall over the past three months, with numerous episodes of flooding across portions of the country, especially the north, to Météo France. The highest levels recorded by Fluidion were 23590 MPN/100mL on May 2 and 13090 MPN/100mL on May 30, according to Angelescu. The May 2 result is more than 20 times higher than World Triathlon’s “good quality” level, according to CNN’s calculation. More recently, following several days of dry and sunny weather, levels on Monday 6 June were 2280 MPN/100mL, according to Angelescu, better than previous results but still above acceptable levels for swimming. If levels remain this high, the swimming leg of the triathlon will have to be cancelled, according to , unless the organization’s medical committee decides that the race can go ahead. Earlier in June, World Triathlon told CNN in an email that the first contingency plan would be to delay the race by one day. But if poor water quality persisted, the triathlon would have to be downgraded to a duathlon with no swimming, the organization confirmed. Angelescu said that while is not typically pathogenic itself, it can indicate the presence of other pathogens, which can cause skin rashes, diarrhea, serious gastrointestinal diseases and, in very rare cases, even death. However, Angelescu said that the water quality of the Seine is likely to improve significantly before July due to drier and sunnier summer conditions, which will reduce the frequency of sewage spills. “It is highly speculative and scientifically unsound to project any conclusions about water quality during the Games based on recent trends,” he said. Angelescu said that “significant infrastructure projects” by the city of Paris designed to improve water quality will have a “substantial” impact. “These tanks are expected to become operational before the Games, potentially becoming a … Games changer,” added Angelescu. “When our instruments and data indicate that the water quality is good, we will be the first to dive in, headfirst!” Angelescu’s tone of optimism isn’t universally shared. French charity Surfrider Foundation Europe in April that they were “genuinely concerned about the health of athletes” after only one of the 14 samples collected by the organization indicated a satisfactory standard of water quality for swimming. Two months later, the charity told CNN that they have since taken five additional samples, with E. coli levels remaining “systematically above the guide values.” CNN has not independently verified the charity’s findings. Paris 2024 said they still have “great confidence” in the city of Paris to improve water quality to the “necessary standard” in time for the Games. “Generally, water quality in the Seine continues to improve every day,” they said in a statement to CNN in early June. “By the time of the Games, bacteriological pollution in the Seine will have been reduced by 75% thanks to the range of actions undertaken by our partners.” In a statement to CNN, the city of Paris said that recent grey and rainy conditions have had a “major impact” on the Seine’s water quality. A lack of sunlight – which would normally help to kill bacteria – has also contributed to the poor quality, they said earlier this month. They added: “It is only when summer conditions (strong sunshine, high temperatures, prolonged absence of rain) become established that the Seine will gradually return to its ‘summer’ appearance, and that we will see a gradual and significant improvement in water quality.” Following multiple days of sunny weather in the first week of June, levels improved near Pont Alexandre III Bridge, according to official data from the city of Paris shared with CNN, but whether the good weather will last remains to be seen. No precipitation trend, higher or lower than average, has been for areas around Paris for the summer. Since June 1, levels declined from around 7000 UFC/100mL (equivalent units to MPN/100mL, according to World Triathlon) to just below 1000 UFC/100mL on June 9, according to official data. However, World Triathlon’s 2024 say that these levels are still too high for swimming, unless the organization’s medical committee decides that the race can go ahead. The threat that and other bacteria pose is nothing new to triathlon teams. Over the last decade, water quality issues have been increasingly encountered, according to Mike Cavendish, Director of Performance at British Triathlon, who outlined preventative measures British athletes will be taking to ensure their health during Paris 2024. “Disinfectant sounds like a really basic thing but it’s something we will be doing a lot of, making sure that athletes are clean, that their equipment is clean,” Cavendish told CNN in a telephone interview. Probiotic yogurts can also help to improve gut health, Cavenish added. Phil Dunne, Triathlon Canada’s High Performance Director, said in a statement to CNN that their athletes are being supported by “a team of physicians and dietitians” to reduce the risk of becoming sick due to “compromised” water quality. Tim Harradine, CEO of AusTriathlon, said that triathletes are used to dealing with the “changing nature” of waterways. “Sometimes they race in the rain, sometimes they race in the heat,” Harradine told CNN in a telephone interview, adding that athlete health will always come first. Lehair, who recently changed her nationality in time to represent Luxembourg at Paris 2024, told CNN that she understands why precautions need to be taken, but didn’t seem altogether convinced by the effectiveness of measures like probiotics. “It’s supposed to be good for the body anyway, so maybe you can have a try but it’s not 100% sure that you won’t get sick if you take probiotics,” she said. “At least maybe you are stressing a bit less on the day of the race.” Paris 2024 isn’t the first sporting event to contend with water quality issues. In March, concerns were raised after bacteria was in London’s River Thames ahead of the historic Oxford and Cambridge boat race. Also, in 2016, from hospital sewage were found in Rio de Janeiro’s Guanabara Bay. Lehair is pleased that the authorities are attempting to clean up the river, but just wishes it had happened sooner. “They should have done this much before, just for the quality of the water in general and for the people, for the city,” she said. “Better quality of water is good for everyone.” Cavendish said that if the authorities’ clean-up efforts in Paris prove successful, other countries could be encouraged to follow suit. “If they pull this off and it looks fantastic, and they get a swim for the Olympics and the Paralympics … it puts pressure on other governments around the world, including our own, to try and make sure that we get safe swimming,” said Cavendish. Harradine echoed that sentiment: “It’s a very visible race venue and what a great legacy it could leave if this works well for the city.” And if the worst comes to the worst and the impact of rain on water quality does threaten the triathlon races Cavendish is confident that the right call will be made. “The eyes of the world are on this race so I think you can guarantee that they (Paris 2024 and World Triathlon) will be putting all the right people in the room to make the right decision,” he said.",

    "content": "have competed under several different guises throughout the 128-year history of the , and they will be known by another new name at . Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – supported by Belarus – in February 2022, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) that Russian and Belarusian athletes should be prohibited from competing in international sporting events. , the IOC announced its intention to allow these athletes to compete as neutrals, in a similar way to how are presented at ATP, WTA and Grand Slam events without any reference to their nationality. The Russian Olympic Committee was then by the IOC in October 2023 when it absorbed Ukrainian regional sports organizations in Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia. There has been much debate around whether Russian and Belarusian athletes should be permitted to take part in the Olympics, with . However, the IOC Executive Board ruled that it would be unfair to punish athletes based on their passports alone, thereby allowing some to compete in Paris, albeit under very strict conditions. Here’s everything you need to know about the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes at the 2024 Olympics. An Individual Neutral Athlete is the name used to refer to athletes with either a Russian or Belarusian passport who will be competing at this year’s Games in July and August. These athletes are referred to by the abbreviation AIN, which comes from the French translation Athlètes Individuels Neutres. These athletes will be permitted to compete if they meet eligibility requirements. No reference to either country will be made at the Games through the athletes’ participation. “The sanctions against those responsible for the war, the Russian and Belarusian states and governments, remain in place for the Olympic Games Paris 2024,” the IOC said in a . “No flag, anthem, colors or any other identifications whatsoever of Russia or Belarus will be displayed at the Olympic Games Paris 2024 in any official venue or any official function,” the statement continues. Competition gear for the AINs has not yet been revealed, so it is unclear whether it will bear the turquoise colors of the brand-new , or that they will don basic sportswear. – without lyrics – has also been commissioned for use in medal ceremonies. Though AINs are eligible to compete and win Olympic medals, they will not be displayed in the medal table of nations. AINs will also be excluded from the parade of delegations at the Opening Ceremony on the basis that they are individual athletes rather than a team, though the IOC has said “an opportunity will be provided for them to experience the event.” In December 2023, the Executive Board of the IOC decided that Russian and Belarusian athletes who qualified through the existing qualification systems of international federations would have to meet strict requirements if they are to be selected as an AIN. There will be no Russian or Belarusian representation in team events, with participation limited to individual competition. Per the IOC, athletes who actively support the war or who are contracted to the Russian or Belarusian military or national security agencies will not be eligible to be entered or to compete. The same stipulation applies to support personnel Like all other athletes, AINs will need to meet anti-doping requirements to be considered for selection. The eligibility of these athletes will be determined by the newly established Individual Neutral Athlete Eligibility Review Panel. Two-time NBA champion and six-time All-Star Pau Gasol is part of the panel, representing the IOC Ethics Commission. The Spaniard will sit alongside IOC Vice-President and former artistic swimmer Nicole Hoevertsz, and former Olympic table tennis gold medalist Ryu Seung-min, who will be representing the Athletes’ Commission. International sporting federations will need to submit their lists of qualified athletes to panel for review. At the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo (postponed to 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic) and the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, Russian athletes competed under the name of the (ROC)  as a result of the country’s state-sponsored doping program. Athletes could compete under the ROC banner if they could prove that they were not connected to the scandal. However, with the ROC bearing both the name and colors of Russia – as well as the subsequent suspension of the ROC in October – it was no longer a viable option for Russian athletes to compete under this name in Paris. It is also important to note that the ROC was not a neutral body, rather a delegation of Russian athletes which technically didn’t compete on the behalf of Russia, but retained a right to represent the country in all but an official capacity. The IOC stated that, as of March 28, 12 AINs with a Russian passport and seven AINs with a Belarusian passport have qualified for Paris 2024 but said that the final number of athletes who will actually compete at the Games would not be communicated until the selection process has been finalized. “The maximum number, which is unlikely to be reached, would be 55 and 28 respectively,” the IOC told CNN. In comparison, Russia sent 330 athletes to Tokyo in 2021 while Belarus sent 104. There is also the matter of whether Moscow will actually accept the conditions laid out by the IOC. Russia is planning to host its own “ ” later in the year, an event which has been condemned by the IOC. The identity of the athletes is also yet to be revealed, but it is possible that Russian former world No. 1 tennis player Daniil Medvedev will be part of the field. The former US Open champion said that he would be happy to participate as a neutral. “I decided for myself that whenever I can play the Olympics, I want to be there I want to represent what I can represent,” last month. “If it’s not under the flag, I know who I am, I know why I play tennis and I played like this all my life. Russia has competed under a neutral banner on two previous occasions. The ROC was suspended in 2017 as a result of the doping scandal ahead of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea the following year, but selected Russian athletes who met pre-competition conditions were still given the opportunity to compete as “ ” and were represented by the Olympic flag. Russia and Belarus were also part of the “ ” at the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona after the dissolution of the Soviet Union the previous year. The delegation was made up of former Soviet republics – aside from the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia – which had elected to compete as one unit. The Unified Team also bore the Olympic flag but winners were honored under the flags of their own nations.",

    "content": "It’s the most powerful position in world sport with high stakes, high expectations and high consequences. Its occupant holds huge sway in shaping the global sporting landscape and narrative, wields extraordinary political clout, and presides over a multi-billion-dollar budget. On Thursday, Kirsty Coventry became the latest occupant to hold this great responsibility when she was elected as the 10th President of International Olympic Committee (IOC), becoming the first woman and African to ever hold this position. Coventry, who will also be the youngest ever to assume the role at age 41, will follow in the footsteps of outgoing President Thomas Bach, who during his 12-year term has overseen . Coventry – – will arrive at a time of heightened geopolitical uncertainty around the globe, question marks over the direction of the Olympic movement in the 21st century, and more scrutiny than ever on issues concerning gender identity and equality, among others. With less than a year to go until the 2026 Winter Games in Milan-Cortina, one of the first items on the agenda will be whether and how to reintegrate Russian and Belarusian athletes back into the Olympic fold , the IOC imposed a blanket ban on athletes from both countries from participating in its events. Just over a year later, though, the organization approved allowing said athletes to take part in international sports tournaments as neutrals in , provided . In total, 32 athletes – 17 Russian and 15 Belarusian passport holders – ended up accepting the IOC’s invitation to compete under the Individual Neutral Athlete (AIN) flag at last year’s Paris Games. Bach recently told that any decision moving forward should continue to be made with the best interests of the athletes and not their nationality or ongoing geopolitical events in mind. “It’s not about Russia. It is about the athletes. Everybody who is following the rules has to have the right to participate in the Olympic Games, full stop,” he told CNN Sports’ Amanda Davies. Russia has already said it will fight for its participation in 2026, while Ukraine has urged the Olympic movement to . With qualification events for next year’s showpiece event and the war in Ukraine still rumbling on, time will be of the essence. Then there is navigating the contentious and unpredictable Trump administration in the lead up to the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles. While Bach has played up the relationship between the IOC and President Donald Trump and his hopes that LA will “expose the US as a sports-loving country,” the US president’s direct, disruptive style of leadership may severely test that resolve. Trump, perhaps more than any other world leader in Games gone by, will want to put his own stamp on proceedings. As the host nation’s head of state, he will likely help formally open the Summer Olympics on July 14, 2028. “Donald Trump becomes the single most important player, the single most important figure outside of the Olympic movement,” said CNN Sports analyst Christine Brennan. “This is a man who loves sports and wants to insert himself in sports every way he can. “I see him being a huge force within that, and I also see him being a very disruptive force within that.” Trump has already warned that visas could be denied to LA-bound competitors based on their nationality and who don’t meet the administration’s gender interpretations, among others. and relations having soured in recent months between the US and some of its long-time allies, the two-time gold medal-winning Olympic swimmer will need to tread a fine line between maintaining the IOC’s principles of neutrality and universality, while also providing a pragmatic approach to ensure all 206 National Olympic Committees, plus the Refugee Olympic Team, are all present at the Athlete’s Village. As it stands, there is currently no clear, unified approach or framework between the IOC and its International Federations (IFs) regarding the participation of athletes with differences in sex development (DSD) and transgender athletes from the local through to the national and global stage. IFs have been able to decide their own participation rules – based on fairness, inclusion and scientific evidence – following a revised framework put in place by the . Some IFs, like , have subsequently adopted tighter regulations with stricter thresholds or additional requirements for DSD athletes, while others, like , have taken a stronger position in banning transgender athletes from competing in elite women’s competitions, citing competitive advantage and safety concerns, among others. The lack of universal rules has been criticized for creating confusion among athletes and stakeholders. This was especially evident during last summer’s Paris Games when boxers , triggering an onslaught of online, transphobic abuse toward athletes “It’s a phenomenon of our world. What does social media do in such cases?” Bach recently told CNN. “You had all sorts of people from all walks of life who were jumping on this without having any idea. We need to dig a little bit deeper how in this world you can really expose the facts and then discuss these facts – and then how to interpret these facts.” Changes made by Coventry, who is currently Zimbabwe’s sports minister, could include the implementation of standardized rules for all sports based on firm scientific evidence, with universal eligibility criteria that will help to simplify policies and subsequently help reduce current confusion. Coventry’s eight-year mandate will run all the way through to 2033. All Games in that window have already been picked – even the , which will be staged in Salt Lake City. With the next decade secured, attention will turn to the selection of the host for the Summer Games in 2036. It will be the first time a decision has been taken since to the Olympic Charter. Furthermore, the IOC has also . Qatar, Saudi Arabia, India and Indonesia, among others, have already all expressed an interest in hosting the Games. While there is no set timetable currently in place for a decision, the . With climate concerns becoming an increasingly prominent consideration in decision-making, a review of the global sports calendar for both Summer and Winter Games could also be undertaken to allow for more interested parties to bid for the Games. Seoul 1988 and Sydney 2000, for example, hosted the summer edition of the Games in the window between September and October. Aside from taking the Games to new corners of the world, the Olympic movement may also start to see a diversification of sports to cater for a younger, digital-minded audience. With the , a push for new forms of delivering the Games to audiences around the world in a rapidly changing entertainment-scape could also see the IOC embrace a push for technological transformation, the likes of which it has never seen before.",

    "title": "\n      Boxing heavyweight great George Foreman, who fought Muhammad Ali in the ‘Rumble in the Jungle,’ dead at 76\n    ",

    "content": ", the two-time world heavyweight boxing champion and Olympic gold medalist whose legendary rivalry with Muhammad Ali culminated in the famous ‘Rumble in the Jungle’ title bout, died Friday according to a verified social media account dedicated to Foreman. He was 76. The Instagram post reads: “Our hearts are broken. With profound sorrow, we announce the passing of our beloved George Edward Foreman Sr. who peacefully departed on March 21, 2025 surrounded by loved ones. A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father, and a proud grand and great grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility, and purpose. “A humanitarian, an Olympian, and two time heavyweight champion of the world, He was deeply respected — a force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name— for his family. “We are grateful for the outpouring of love and prayers, and kindly ask for privacy as we honor the extraordinary life of a man we were blessed to call our own.” Known as one of the most powerful punchers in boxing history, Foreman won Olympic gold in only his 25th amateur fight, devastated one of the all-time greats in Joe Frazier and went on to retain the heavyweight title twice before his now-iconic 1974 fight with Ali in Kinshasha, Zaire - now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo. Foreman also enjoyed major success as an entrepreneur, with his product debuting in 1994 and going on to sell more than 100 million units worldwide. Foreman’s victory over Soviet fighter Jonas Čepulis at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico sparked the beginning of his professional career, but his celebration was also significant. He took a small American flag and waved it to every corner of the stadium – a memorable moment, given that just ten days earlier his US teammates Tommie Smith and John Carlos gave the Black Power salute on the podium. It was an action for which Foreman has no regrets, despite backlash when he returned to the US. He told The Undefeated: “When I walked into the Olympic Village, I saw a couple of athletes who looked like me. I went to speak to them, but they couldn’t speak English. For the first time, I realized that the only thing that could identify us was our nation’s colors. “I waved the flag so they knew I was American. Everyone started applauding, so I waved it higher. That is the only reason I had that flag. If I had to do it all over again, I would have had two flags in my pocket.” He continued: “I proudly walked down Lyons Avenue in the Fifth Ward [in Houston] wearing my medal. A guy I thought was a friend walked up, looked me in the face and said, ‘How could you do what you did when the brothers [Smith and Carlos] were doing their thing?’ It … broke … my … heart. I didn’t expect that.” Foreman turned professional, and won his first 37 bouts before taking on world heavyweight champion Joe Frazier in Kingston, Jamaica, in January 1973. Despite being the clear underdog, Foreman knocked Frazier down six times in two rounds to claim the WBA and WBC heavyweight belts, and become heavyweight champion. His two defenses of the title - first downing Puerto Rico’s Jose Roman in 50 seconds and then beating American Ken Norton, who had just defeated Ali, in just two rounds – set up the “Rumble in the Jungle” bout in Zaire in October 1974. The event had huge cultural and political significance. The decision to hold the fight in Zaire was controversial, with criticism over human rights abuses and corruption under late President Mobutu Sese Seko. It was also seen as a platform for Black athletes to promote African unity. The fight itself – which saw both contenders guaranteed $5 million each, a huge amount at the time in the sport - is seen as one of the greatest ever. Using a tactic later known as “rope-a-dope,” Ali was able to withstand Foreman’s punches by leaning back on the ropes, before landing a series of blows in the eighth round in what turned out to be his only knockout defeat in a 28-year professional career. “I thought this would be the easiest $5 million I was going to pick up,” Foreman told CNN following Ali’s death in 2016. “I hit him hard in the third round, and he looked at me as if to say, ‘I’m not gonna take it!’ “He hit me with a quick one-two, knocked me down to the canvas and my whole life changed. I was devastated. Little did I know I would make the best friend I ever had in my life.” A dedicated Christian, Foreman became an ordained minister after losing his second professional boxing match in 1977 and retired from the sport. Ten years later, despite being Foreman returned to the ring at the age of 39, even taking on the 28-year-old Evander Holyfield in 1991 in a fight dubbed “The Battle of the Ages,” though he ultimately lost via unanimous decision. Foreman went on to stun the boxing world in 1994 when he won the IBF and WBA heavyweight titles by defeating Michael Moorer. It was 20 years after his loss to Ali. , Foreman said the victory felt more special than his first heavyweight title win against Frazier. “The second time I made a point of believing it,” he said. “The first time I didn’t believe it. When you fight for the heavyweight championship of the world it does feel unbelievable, it doesn’t feel like you’re really there, it could be a dream. ‘You’re going to wake up soon, you don’t belong in the ring with these guys.’” Foreman finally retired for good in 1997, with a career record of An , Foreman grew up as one of seven children in the troubled Fifth Ward in Houston, and often bullied younger children before of high school. He joined the Job Corps when he was 16, doing construction work and forestry – and it was there that he met Job Corps counsellor and boxing coach Doc Broaddus, which set Foreman on the way to He also launched a clothing line and a short-lived reality TV show starring himself with his wife Mary Joan and 12 children – including Foreman continued to . “My mother [Nancy] would have approved of [my ministry work] in a way she never did my boxing,” Foreman told Sorted magazine in March 2024. In 2019, Foreman’s daughter Freeda, , died by apparent suicide. He posted on social media about his “first Sunday in 42 years without my Freeda”. In 2022, two women accused Foreman of sexually abusing them when they were minors in the 1970s, according to lawsuits filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Foreman denied the allegations, and in March 2024 filed a court declaration requesting that one of the lawsuits was tossed out. CNN has previously reached out to representatives for Foreman for comment on allegations of sexual abuse and assault. A film about his life – “Big George Foreman” – was released in 2023. He told CNN that delving into his past was difficult and seeing his struggles growing up on screen moved him to tears. “You go through life building a big fence, bricks and everything to cover up your life, to hide your life,” he . “Then all of a sudden, you got to reveal all those things you’re trying to hide. “It’s not easy to tell a story about your life when you really spend a lifetime hiding your life.”",

The tributes came from the boxing world, former NBA stars, rappers as well as figures such as Billie Jean King and President Donald Trump, showing the reach of Foreman’s stardom. Trump called the two-time heavyweight boxing champion and Olympic gold medalist a “GREAT FIGHTER” in a post on his Truth Social account on Saturday. Trump added that Foreman had the “heaviest and biggest punch in the history of boxing” and said with the exception of Muhammad Ali, “when you got hit, you went down.” He praised Foreman as a “great person, with a personality that was bigger than life,” and sent condolences to his family. Foreman belonged to an era when boxing exerted a vast pull on pop culture. An estimated one billion people watched the “Rumble in the Jungle” heavyweight title fight against Ali in 1974. Hall of Fame boxer Mike Tyson said Foreman’s “contributions to boxing and beyond will never be forgotten” and posted two pictures of the two heavyweights together. NBA icon Magic Johnson remembered attending “so many of George’s championship fights,” as he paid tribute to one of his “boxing heroes” on X. “He was a knockout artist in the ring, and it was a pleasure getting to know him not only as a boxer but as a man. After leaving the ring, he turned into an amazing businessman — I even bought one of the first George Foreman grills!” Johnson added. Basketball Hall of Famer Charles Barkley said the news left him “shook up right now” during an emotional tribute on CBS Sports’ coverage of the men’s NCAA basketball tournament. “Rest in peace, George Foreman. Your legacy lives on, champ,” Basketball Hall of Famer and six-time NBA champion Scottie Pippen said on X, alongside a photo of the boxer. Twelve-time grand slam winner King paid her own tribute on social media too, saying that Foreman “bet on me in the Battle of the Sexes, and acted as a bodyguard to help me after the match when the crowds stormed the court.” “Sad to learn that two-time heavyweight champion boxer, Olympic Gold medalist, and entrepreneur George Foreman has passed away,” she wrote. “He was a great champion and a good friend … Our condolences to his family. May he rest in power.” Chuck D, the frontman of Public Enemy, posted a portrait of Foreman on X, adding that “George was one of my HEROES.” CNN’s Christian Sierra contributed to this reporting.",

Hendrickson trailed 4-2 in the match to but scored a shocking takedown in the final seconds – the only takedown Steveson allowed all season – to win the final 5-4 at the 2025 NCAA wrestling championships in Philadelphia. When his victory was confirmed, Hendrickson fell to his back in disbelief as he was mobbed by his coaching staff while Steveson rested on his knees in amazement. After getting to his feet, Hendrickson saluted President Donald Trump who was in attendance, later shaking his hand and hugging him in celebration, while draped in an American flag. “It’s bigger than worlds, Olympics, anything,” an emotional Hendrickson said afterwards, per AP. Steveson, a gold medalist in the 125kg weight class at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, entered the final on a 70-match unbeaten streak and almost completed his fourth straight college season without losing, but for his defeat on Saturday. Hendrickson also entered Saturday’s final on an unbeaten streak but fell behind to the two-time national champion with the result looking certain. But with 20 seconds remaining, Hendrickson managed to complete an unlikely takedown and take the lead before holding on for the remaining time as the crowd went wild. “I was looking at the clock and I’m squeezing him,” Hendrickson said, according to Oklahoma State, when asked about what he was thinking when holding on in the final seconds. “I made up my mind. If he did stand up, I didn’t want to lock my hands. I don’t want to get a locked hands call, but I was squeezing. “If he stands up, I’m just going to lock and pick him up and just hold him in the air for the last couple seconds, because I’m, like, ‘I have made it this far,’ and I knew I was going to win this match. I don’t care if I had to rip my arms off squeezing him. I was, like, ‘I’m holding this man down and winning this match.’” Hendrickson’s dramatic victory completed a successful day for Oklahoma State after Dean Hamiti Jr. produced his own upset victory, beating two-time national champion Keegan O’Toole to win the 174-pound title. Elsewhere, Penn State’s Carter Starocci won a fifth national title, defeating Northern Iowa’s Parker Keckeisen 4-3 in the 184-pound final.",

    "content": "Australian sprinter may only be 17, but 200-meter champion Letsile Tebogo says the teenage sensation has the potential to be one of the greatest athletes in history. Gout, widely considered one of the fastest youngsters in the world, has put together a series of breathtaking in recent months to grab the attention of the very best in the business. Sprint legend Usain Bolt has previously said that Gout “looks like young me” and now Tebogo, who upset Noah Lyles to win the 200m gold medal at Paris 2024, has had his say. “His style of running, it’s top-notch,” Tebogo told journalists ahead of the in Melbourne this week. “I believe he’s going to be the next big thing for the continent.” Gout in 2022 when he ran the 100m in 10.57 seconds as a 14-year-old, but garnered even more attention last year when he ran 200m in 20.60 at the World Athletics U20 Championships – 0.01 seconds faster than a 15-year-old Bolt managed in 2002. He has continued his hot form into this season and ran a world-leading time of 20.05 seconds in the 200m earlier this month, just 0.01 outside his own Australian record which he set in December. He then followed it up by becoming the first-ever Australian to break the 20-second barrier, running 19.98 seconds in the Queensland State Championships under-20 200m final. However, the time won’t stand as an official record because of illegal wind conditions (+3.6m/s). Gout will race again in the 200m event in Melbourne this week, where he’s set to face Australia’s current fastest man, Lachie Kennedy. The teenager will not be facing Tebogo, though, who will instead test himself in the 400m event. “He can be one of the best, he can be in the history books,” Tebogo added, per . “If he continues the hunger that he has right now, he could go very far.” Tebogo has warned Gout and his team to take things slowly, urging them to not rush into racing on the senior tour. “The best advice I was told was that Rome wasn’t built in a day. I couldn’t get the concept at first,” the 21-year-old said. “Just introduce him slowly to the seniors … because with the seniors we are all hungry to get the money, the medals and everything.” CNN’s Matias Grez and George Ramsay contributed reporting.",

Undaunted by the occasion, Ruthe went on to become the first 15-year-old to run a sub-four-minute mile, even managing a nonchalant shrug of the shoulders as he crossed the finish line. The race was almost entirely engineered for the high school student to break the fabled four-minute barrier – a feat first achieved by more than 70 years ago – but the weight of running history was a burden that Ruthe seemed to bear lightly. The first three laps, he later said in a video documenting the race, “felt pretty comfortable – nothing too crazy.” Perhaps the most intimidating part of his achievement occurred when Ruthe returned to school the next day, only to be immediately called into the principal’s office. “He’s like, ‘Alright, so you’re gonna have to go up on stage and we’ll get the whole school to clap you,’” Ruthe tells Patrick Snell. “It was really scary, actually. I headed into class and everyone thought I was famous.” It’s easy to forget, given his history-making performance last week, that Ruthe is like most other 15-year-olds in New Zealand. He goes to school, spends time with his friends, and helps with chores around the house. He also just happens to be one of the most exciting middle-distance runners on the planet, one of the latest star athletes to emerge from sports-mad New Zealand. “Every morning I come downstairs and he’s already done the dishwasher, he’s already packed his lunch, and he’s ready to go,” Ruthe’s father, Ben, tells CNN Sports. “He’s just a disciplined kid. He goes to bed early, he looks after himself, he eats well, he looks after his sister. He’s just a good kid around the house in all ways, really. We’re very lucky.” Ruthe is next due to compete in the 1,500 meters at the Maurie Plant Meet in Melbourne on Saturday, and one target time to aim for will be his dad’s fastest time of 3:41.22 – three hundredths of a second faster than Ruthe’s current personal best. But he still has a way to go before he can call himself the most decorated runner in his family. Dad Ben and mom Jess are both former national champions who represented New Zealand on the world stage, while his maternal grandparents won European championship medals for Great Britain. His grandmother, Rosemary Stirling, arguably had the most impressive achievement: an 800m Commonwealth Games title from 1970. Despite his family pedigree, Ruthe was never under any pressure to take running seriously. His parents, in fact, didn’t allow him or his sister Daisy to train at all until they were 13, never wanting their identities to be tied solely to running. “It feels like it’s the right decision about now,” says Ben. But as he gradually starts to realize his potential, Ruthe, when pushed, admits to having big goals in the sport. “If I had to pick one thing, definitely Olympic gold,” he says. “I feel like that’s most runners’ dream and the biggest thing you can actually win. So that’ll definitely be the top of my bucket list.” The 2032 Olympics in Brisbane, Ruthe adds, would be a nice target. And as for the Los Angeles Games in three years’ time? “I’d actually love to try and qualify for LA 28,” he says. “I feel like that’ll be a tough goal. But if I do that, I’ll be really happy.” Already, Ruthe’s name is being mentioned in the same breath as Norway’s , the most successful middle-distance of this generation. It was his record as the youngest-ever four-minute miler that Ruthe took last week, and the New Zealander also beat Ingebrigtsen’s 1,500m record for a 15-year-old earlier this year. Ingebrigtsen’s success, Ruthe says, has given him hope that he too can “have a good future” in the sport. But his biggest source of motivation comes not from the two-time Olympic champion, but from those closest to him – his training group led by coach Craig Kirkwood and athlete Sam Tanner. The pair were instrumental in Ruthe’s recent mile time of 3:58.35, and it was five-time national champion Tanner who paced him perfectly around four laps of the track on his way to the record. To show his gratitude, Ruthe is auctioning off the shoes he wore for the four-minute mile to raise funds for Kirkwood, Tanner and their youth development group, with the currently standing at NZ$10,000 (just over $5,700). For his father, it’s a source of huge pride that Ruthe is unwilling to forget those who have helped him on his journey – something demonstrated by a readiness to part with the record-setting running shoes. “To see my son be able to give away probably his most valuable possession in the world to help those around him?” says Ben. “It means a lot to me.”",

    "content": "The men’s 1,500-meter final always promised to deliver drama, but perhaps not quite like this. This was supposed to be a showdown between Jakob Ingebrigtsen, the reigning champion, and Josh Kerr, the world champion. So it was a shock to everyone inside the Stade de France when a different runner entirely surged into the lead in the final straight to claim an unlikely, improbable win. Cole Hocker’s victory was arguably the biggest upset of the Games so far, a wild ending to a thrilling race for the ages. The American stretched out his arms in delight as he crossed the line and capped off a superbly executed sprint finish, taking the gold medal in an Olympic record time of 3:27.65. Great Britain’s Kerr took the silver medal in 3:27.79, while Hocker’s compatriot, Yared Nuguse, was a hundredth of a second back in third. And Norway’s Ingebrigtsen, the brightest middle and long-distance talent of this generation? He was fourth, stunningly outside of the medals having led for much of the race. Instead, this was a night for the underdog – though Hocker never saw it that way. “That’s an unbelievable feeling,” the Indiana native said after the victory. “I just felt like I was getting carried by the stadium and God. My body just kind of did it for me. My mind was all there and I saw that finish line. “Winning gold was my goal this entire year. I wrote that down and I repeated it to myself even if I didn’t believe it. My performances showed me that I was capable of running 3:27, whatever it took. I knew I was a medal contender, and I knew that if I get it right, it would be a gold medal. I’ve been saying that.” When Ingebrigtsen, who set an Olympic record in this event three years ago, set off at a strong pace and Kerr followed not far behind, it looked like the race would play out as many expected, a straight shootout between the two fierce rivals who have been trading barbs for months. And when Kerr moved past the Norwegian in the last 100 meters, victory was squarely in his sights, a repeat result of last year’s world championships in Budapest. But then came Hocker. The 23-year-old drove up the inside of the finishing straight in a perfectly-timed surge, the second American in the last three Olympics to win this event after Matthew Centrowitz in 2016. And then came Nuguse, flying past Ingebrigtsen and chasing down Kerr. His bronze in a personal-best time marked the first time in the history of the modern Games that the US has had two men on the 1,500m podium. For American middle-distance running, this result was as brilliant as it was unexpected. Hocker’s only other major accolade heading into the Olympics was a 1,500m silver at this year’s world indoor championships, while Nuguse’s was a medal of the same color in the 3,000m. Both men took also chunks off their personal bests – Hocker by nearly three seconds. “Cole Hocker you got me screaming my head off,” his countryman and Olympic 100-meter champion Noah Lyles on X. Kerr, an Olympic bronze medalist three years ago, didn’t get the victory he so desperately craved, but the Scottish athlete still came away with a silver medal and a British record. “My ears are gone, my legs are gone,” he said. “I’m proud of the performance I put out there today,” he added. “I said to myself I’ll control my controllables and I did that today. I executed the fastest that I’ve ever run by almost two seconds. It wasn’t enough today. That’s sport. “I’m very proud of myself and my preparation coming in. I left no stones unturned and that’s the result today. Of course, I was looking for that gold medal, but it’s a better medal than I got three years ago.” As for Ingebrigtsen, it will be fascinating to see how he bounces back for the 5,000 meters, an event in which he has won back-to-back world titles. On Tuesday, he ultimately paid for a too-fast start, forced to watch on as a trio of runners moved past him. Did he regret those tactics? “No and yes,” the 23-year-old told reporters. “Of course, it’s a tactical error that I’m not able to reduce my pace in the first 800, it was just a little too hard. “But I think you saw on the back straight with probably 50, 60 [meters] to go, they were opening a little bit of a gap. I tried to respond by going just a little bit too much on the gas and it was just 100 meters too much today.”",

    "title": "\n      With some athletes ‘suffering financially,’ Michael Johnson hopes his new league can bring value to track and field\n    ",

    "content": "Michael Johnson wants to make one thing clear: doesn’t need saving. But he does think it needs improving. For Johnson and many others, we are reminded of the sport’s potential once every four years when, for a brief, two-week window, athletes compete for status and legacy at the Summer . In that moment, track and field is suddenly the most popular show on the planet, the short-lived center of the sporting universe. It’s what happens over the next four years that the sprinter-turned-commissioner has concerns about. “That’s the void that has existed in the sport,” Johnson tells ’ Amanda Davies, “and we’re filling it with Grand Slam Track.” Spearheaded by the four-time Olympic champion, Grand Slam Track hosts its inaugural event in Kingston, Jamaica on Friday – the first of four meets taking place across the next three months. The league has attracted some of the biggest names in the sport, including American Olympic champions Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, Gabby Thomas, and Quincy Hall. Athletes signing up for Grand Slam Track have been promised regular, meaningful races against their fiercest rivals, as well as more prize money than the sport has ever offered before. The 48 racers contracted by the league each receive an annual base salary for competing in the four meets over the course of the season, while $12.6 million in prize money is also on offer. That ranges from $100,000 for winning a slam to $10,000 for placing last. By contrast, in the Diamond League – the sport’s established annual series of track and field meets – athletes receive $10,000 for winning an event and $1,000 for placing eighth. “Most of the athletes suffer greatly because they aren’t able to realize any value,” says Johnson, best remembered for winning 200-meter and 400-meter gold medals at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. “Those athletes end up in situations where, many years later, and sometimes even in their careers, they’re wondering: ‘Should I have made this choice? I love this sport, but I’m suffering financially, I’m suffering mentally trying to make a living in this sport. I’m having to rely on friends and family to help.’” The debut Grand Slam Track season will see 48 contracted racers, who are among the world’s top athletes, and 48 challengers, selected on an event-by-event basis, competing in six event groups: short and long sprints, short and long hurdles, and short and long distance. Each athlete is assigned to an event group and will compete in two disciplines at every meet. Short sprinters, for example, will race in the 100 and 200 meters, and long sprinters in the 200 and 400 meters. Points are earned based on an athlete’s finishing position in a race, and whoever has the most points across the two races at a meet is crowned the winner of an event group. “That creates some significant narratives and jeopardy, which is what fans told us they want,” says Johnson. “They want to see the athletes more. They also want to see some jeopardy and some stakes.” With the contracted racers guaranteed to appear at every event, Grand Slam Track hopes to showcase the sport’s top athletes more regularly, beyond the Olympics and the biennial World Athletics Championships. But there are significant absentees from the roster, including the likes of Sha’Carri Richardson, , Karsten Warholm and Femke Bol. Notably, the two reigning Olympic 100m champions – and Julien Alfred – have not signed up, and the league only features track – and not field – disciplines, meaning there is no place for superstar pole vaulter . However, those who have joined are encouraged by the league’s approach, particularly when it comes to compensating athletes. “I’ve never had a base salary from a series of races before, that’s entirely novel,” American distance runner tells CNN Sports. “For distance runners and for sprinters, pretty much anyone in track, your main source of income is from a shoe company – that’d be your main sponsor. “You might get an appearance fee at a race here and there, but unless you’re a superstar, you’re probably not getting money to show up places. Whereas with Grand Slam, you have an incentive to show up, and then you have a huge incentive to race well. The prize purse is unlike anything this sport has ever seen … It’s a massive shift.” Fisher, a two-time Olympic bronze medalist who recently broke two indoor world records, will compete in the 3,000 and 5,000 meters – the long distance event group – as a contracted racer at this season’s four meets. He won’t be up against all his big rivals, such as two-time Olympic champion Ingebrigtsen, but still feels that Grand Slam Track is the platform he needs to elevate his career. “I want to race the best guys as often as possible, and I want to be the best runner in the world,” says Fisher. “In order to have that title, I need to beat the best guys in the world consistently. “It’s a cool format, it’s new. It gives fans something to follow with continuity, and I’m excited to be part of it. When they approached me, probably not great negotiation tactics, but I was kind of already sold on joining … They really didn’t have to win me over too much.” This season’s races will be broadcast in 189 countries and territories, with Peacock and The CW serving as broadcasters in the US, Eurosport in Europe and Asia, and TNT Sports in the UK and Ireland. Both Eurosport and TNT Sports are sister companies of CNN under the Warner Bros. Discovery umbrella. Inside Kingston’s National Stadium, the track has already been painted in the green, yellow and black of Jamaica’s flag in anticipation of the league’s opening event. The next three meets will be in the US – Miami, Philadelphia and Los Angeles – which Johnson says will serve a huge market for track and field, though one with few elite races to show for it. The 57-year-old insists that Grand Slam Track is not trying to usurp the likes of World Athletics, the sport’s global governing, and the Diamond League, which holds most of its events in Europe. “We’re a different product,” he says, adding that he has “a great relationship” with World Athletics and its president, Sebastian Coe. In turn, Coe Johnson’s league, taking comfort in the “luster” and “investment” being injected into the sport. Grand Slam Track only has plans to grow and, according to Johnson, has been contacted by cities interested in hosting future meets. “This is a journey for us, and we’re in it for the long haul,” he says. “We’re not going anywhere.” For athletes like Fisher, who faces the demanding prospect of racing two distance events in three days this week, Grand Slam Track will ostensibly feel the same as other races he has competed in, and his targets for the season-opener in Kingston are simple. “The only goal is to win,” he says. “If I can consistently win these Slams, then that’s a really good sign for where I am in my career.”",

    "content": "For a six-day period, felt like everything he touched would turn to gold. The American distance runner had never held a world record at the start of the year, but over the course of back-to-back races in February, he broke two in the space of a week: first in the indoor 3,000 meters, then the indoor 5,000 meters. Looking back, Fisher calls them both “super, super rare” moments when all the factors needed to break a record lined up in his favor. For a brief time in New York and then in Boston, he felt invincible. Holding off the challenge of compatriot at The Millrose Games on February 8, Fisher ran 7:22.91 for the 3,000m – almost a second faster than Ethiopian Lamecha Girma’s mark set two years ago – before running a solo 12:44.09 in the 5,000m on Valentine’s Day to take the record from another Ethiopian – the legendary Kenenisa Bekele. Even now, it still hasn’t sunk in. “The times don’t seem real to me – 12:44 doesn’t sound like a 5k time, and 7:22 doesn’t sound like a 3k time,” Fisher tells . “But those are attached to my name forever.” Perhaps most impressive was that Fisher ran both the world records in entirely different circumstances. In New York, he was pushed right to the line by Hocker, only moving past the Olympic 1,500m champion on the final straight. “We just kept winding it up and winding it up, and it ended up that I needed a world record to beat Cole that day, which is kind of crazy,” says Fisher, who beamed through exhaustion after crossing the finish line. Then in Boston, the 27-year-old was essentially on his own for half of the race, weaving through slower runners on the closing laps. By that point, he didn’t need to look at the clock to know that he was edging closer to a world record; the roar of the crowd told him as much. With no competition near him, Fisher could only tell himself to push harder and harder –arguably a bigger mental challenge than having a rival to race against. “It was just me grinding against me,” he says, “a different mindset when there’s no carrot in front of you. Fisher placed himself among the world’s top distance runners by winning Olympic bronze medals in the 5,000m and 10,000m last year, but the two records have propelled his career to even greater heights. He is set to run in the in Jamaica on Friday – a new league spearheaded by American legend Michael Johnson which features some of the world’s best sprint and endurance athletes. The goal for the coming weeks, when Fisher will race eight times across Grand Slam Track’s four events, is to win each time he steps onto the track. “There are two kind of big sides to the sport,” says Fisher. “One is see how fast you can go, and one is can you beat everybody else in the world? I know I can go fast, so the next piece is to see if I can beat everybody else out there.” Fisher is one of 48 “racers” contracted to compete in Grand Slam Track, receiving a base salary and up to $100,000 in prize money should he win an event. He’ll face strong competition from Kenyan Ronald Kwemoi, who won 5,000m silver ahead of Fisher at the Olympics, but not Norway’s , the winner of that race in Paris who hasn’t signed up for the new series. However, Fisher feels confident that Grand Slam Track will allow the fastest runners to race against each other more regularly, as well as being a way to crown the world’s best athletes in a season-long competition outside of the Olympics and World Athletics Championships. “I know I’m world class,” he says. “I have been really close to being the best in the world before, but I never really have had that title, so I’m going for the win every single time. I think all eight people in these fields are going to say that same thing – that’s the reason to show up to these things is to win.” Up until last year, Fisher was in danger of becoming a nearly-man at major races, finishing fourth and sixth at the world championships in 2022 and fifth and ninth at the Olympics the year before. But a coaching change at the start of last year shifted the trajectory of his career. Fisher left the Bowerman Track Club in Oregon at the end of 2023 and relocated to Park City, Utah to be trained by his high school coach Mike Scannell. He says that the coaching change, as well as living and training at altitude, has over time been “massive” for his development, carrying him to world records and Olympic medals. In doing so, Fisher has established himself as a core part of the US’ flourishing crop of male middle- and long-distance runners, alongside Hocker and 1,500m bronze medalist . “American distance running is at an all-time high right now, I think,” says Fisher, pointing to Matt Centrowitz’s 1,500m Olympic gold in Rio as a moment that inspired his generation. “When I was younger, the narrative was kind of that Americans couldn’t really compete with the rest of the world, and specifically the really strong East African nations in distance running. “(Centrowitz’s) performance there, performance in 2016 as well, those I think unlocked the minds of a lot of younger athletes … People go into races now, and Americans aren’t afraid.” If self-belief is a central ingredient to success, then Fisher is sure to only have bigger and better things on the horizon. Off the back of his world records, he’s still wrapping his head around how fast he managed to run twice in the space of six days, still adjusting to his name being mentioned alongside some of the greats of the sport. As the year progresses, that will likely be happening with more and more regularity – especially if Fisher is able to maintain the form of his life.",

CNN has reached out to local French police and Fiji Rugby for comment. In a statement, Castres said the club “is in mourning” and postponed its game against ASM Clermont that was scheduled for Saturday. “The entire CO (Castres Olympique) family is shaken by this terrible news,” the statement read. “Josh had been part of the club since 2021.

    "content": "Former Olympic cyclist and world champion Rohan Dennis received a suspended sentence on Wednesday over what was termed a “tragic accident” that led to the death of his wife, The 34-year-old Dennis appeared in South Australia District Court after earlier pleading guilty to a charge of committing an aggravated act likely to cause harm. Dennis was arrested after Hoskins, 32, was struck by his vehicle in front of their home at Medindie in Adelaide’s north on Dec. 30, 2023. Hoskins suffered serious injuries in the crash and died at Royal Adelaide Hospital. The court was told that the couple had argued over kitchen renovations before Dennis left their home and drove away. The court also heard that Hoskins had jumped onto the hood of the car during the incident. His licence was also suspended for five years. Dennis on Wednesday was sentenced to one year, four months and 28 days in jail, to be suspended for two years. The sentence was reduced from two years and two months because of his guilty plea and he’s been placed on a two-year good behavior bond. The offense carried a maximum sentence of seven years in jail but lawyer Jane Abbey asked that her client receive a suspended sentence, which was not opposed by the prosecution. During sentencing submissions in in April, Amanda Hoskins said her daughter had loved Dennis “and I know that you would never intentionally hurt her.” “I believe this is a tragic accident. Your temper is your downfall and needs to be addressed,” she said. Hoskins’ funeral was held in her home city of Perth, Western Australia and a public memorial service was held in Adelaide in February 2024. Dennis attended the service with their two children. Hoskins competed at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics on the track in the team pursuit and was in the squad that won the 2015 world title. Dennis won two world titles in the road time trial, as well as silver in the team pursuit at the 2012 Olympics and bronze in the road time trial at the Tokyo Olympics.",

    "content": "More than sporting excellence and closets stuffed full of medals, skiing legends and have something in common: perseverance in the face of failure. While Gu – who became the youngest champion in freestyle skiing at the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022 at 18 – is known for her successes, they weren’t always guaranteed. Gu, who competes for China, became the first woman to land a double cork 1440, and in the moment leading up to the trick, she admits she had to be OK with the idea of not being successful in her attempt. “In this moment, if I (saw) that I’m free to try, it’s going to be a story and a legacy in and of itself regardless of if I land,” Gu said speaking to at the recent Laureus World Sports Awards in Madrid. “If I didn’t land, I would be equally proud of myself for trying because what often holds women, particularly young women, back is the fear of trying – and that’s what happens when girls drop out of sports precipitously from age 11 to 14. “Really the story that I wanted to tell was: go out there, do your very best, and if you landed, awesome, but if you don’t, still be proud of yourself,” she added. Now 21, Gu has her sights on her second Winter Olympics when the Games come to Milan-Cortina in 2026. Also hoping to compete is American skier , who earlier this year came out of retirement and concluded her with a second-place finish in a World Cup super-G race. “A lot of women and girls are afraid to try because of the fear of failure, and I’ve fallen a million times and I’ve always gotten back up, so I’m not afraid to fail at anything,” Vonn said. It is this defiance in the face of potential failure which is key to Vonn’s success. The American star came second in the super-G at the World Cup finals in March to become the to make the podium of a World Cup race by six years. She retired from the sport in February 2019 but announced last year she would be returning to the slopes after undergoing a successful partial knee replacement in April 2024. Vonn acknowledged that there are factors that some consider detrimental to her ability to win. “Is my age a factor? Yeah. (Are) my, are my injuries a factor? Yes, but … you’ve got to do what you love, and if I fail, so be it, but I always believed in myself, and it’s gotten me this far,” Vonn told CNN. “A lot of people say as they get older, the fear increases – that’s your mind. Do what you set your mind to. If you believe you can’t do it, then of course.” Vonn has already expressed her desire to conclude this chapter of her career at the Winter Games. She already has a record 12 World Cup wins at Cortina d’Ampezzo. She told the Associated Press that she was “definitely am thinking about (the Olympics) and I hope that I can get there.” “I have to keep things going and if I can make it, it would be a thrilling and a great way to kind of close the loop on my career – I guess the second chapter of my career. But I’m really trying not to think that far ahead,” she Vonn has plenty of supporters who think she has a shot at medaling again. “I’m pretty sure Lindsey can win at least one medal,” three-time Olympic champion Maria Höfl-Riesch told CNN Sports. ”I mean she could do it in both events, of course. I think it depends on if it’s working in the first one, then maybe the second one is coming easier.” Vonn said she was hopeful for herself and Gu when it came to bagging medals. “I would say you (Eileen) got three last Olympics. My best was two and I have three potential events. So I think, on average, we should hopefully come away with three or four. I think four would be a pretty solid bet,” Vonn said.",

    "content": "Cleveland Browns quarterback said his “job here isn’t to prove people wrong” but to “prove myself right” as he spoke to the media for the first time since his dramatic slide and fifth round selection during the . The 144th pick is among the next generation of players being put through their paces with rookie minicamps taking place across the league. And, after being one of the main storylines during the NFL draft, the 23-year-old said he is grateful for the opportunity with the Cleveland Browns. “I’m just thankful for the opportunity. Things could have been a lot worse, but I’m here smiling in front of you all at this facility right now.” Such was the discussion around Sanders’ slide down the draft, US President Donald Trump even posted on social media in support of the former Colorado star. Sanders said Saturday he was “truly thankful” for the support from the president, as well as “other fans, people in barber shops, just lots of fans.” He added that “other people’s opinion of you is gonna be based off their own.” “Ninety-nine percent of hatred is towards pops and then I’m just his son, so it really just comes from that. And I’ve told him that too,” he said, laughing. Sanders is the son of Colorado Buffaloes head coach and Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders. “It’s the older generation that do it to me rather than the younger people because when I come in person there’s no negativity I see,” he added. “But it’s all over online.” Elsewhere at Browns practice, No. 5 pick Mason Graham was seen vomiting in his helmet after a workout. Cleveland head coach Kevin Stefanski joked that he may have had too many wings before practice. “He did, that was gross,” Stefanski told reporters, confirming Graham’s struggles. “I think he ate too much. The cooking in the kitchen was too good, a few less wings next time.” It’s clear that Graham is going to leave it all on the field for the Browns, but the defensive tackle will be hoping for easier days in the future. The top two picks in the 2025 NFL Draft have also been refining their skills in their rookie minicamps. Cam Ward, the No. 1 overall pick, has been training with the Tennessee Titans looking to get sharp ahead of the new season. Ward had an impressive college career, most recently at the University of Miami, and will be hoping his collegiate performances carry over to the NFL. One of the most exciting picks of the 2025 draft was the No. 2 overall selection, Travis Hunter. Hunter has the rare ability to play on both sides of the ball and anticipation has been growing as to whether he can do this in the NFL. Fans will be eagerly waiting to see if the Heisman Trophy winner does play both offense and defense in practice and then in games as the season gets underway. The schedule for the 2025 NFL season is released on May 14 and these rookies will be hoping to be game ready for the season opener.",

    "content": "With every game, the season seems to be getting worse. And a day after a historically bad loss, the team has parted ways with manager Bud Black. Despite a 9-3 win on Sunday to snap an eight-game losing streak, Black was “relieved of his duties” after compiling a 543-690 record since being named the manager in 2017. Rockies owner, chairman, and CEO Dick Monfort called the team’s performance this season “unacceptable.” “Our fans deserve better, and we are capable of better,” Monfort said in a . “While we all share responsibility in how this season has played out, these changes are necessary. We will use the remainder of 2025 to improve where we can on the field and to evaluate all areas of our operation so we can properly turn the page into the next chapter of Rockies Baseball.” Along with Black, bench coach Mike Redmond was also fired, which Monfort thanked for their “contributions to the team for across their eight years here.” Third base coach Warren Schaefer was named the interim manager through the end of the season. Now at 7-33, they have endured the worst start to the season, tying the Baltimore Orioles in 1988. Before that, you must go back to before modern era, back to the 1884 Kansas City Cowboys and 1876 Cincinnati Reds, to find another team with such a bad record at this point in the season. And on Saturday, they had another historically bad night, succumbing to a 21-0 loss against the San Diego Padres at Coors Field. It was the Rockies’ worst ever shutout loss, the Padres’ largest ever margin of victory and just one run shy of the largest shutout victory in the league since at least 1900. Padres’ pitcher Stephen Kolek made history too on just his second-ever MLB start, equaling the record set by Red Ruffing in 1939 and Ed Siever in 1901 for the largest individual shutout. “I’m actually feeling pretty good right now,” Kolek said afterward, as his teammates dumped a cooler of water on him in celebration. “Anything like this is amazing, I’m just grateful.” And it could have been even worse for the Rockies. At the top of the sixth inning, the Padres already had a 20-0 lead and were on course to challenge both the MLB record for runs in a game (30) and hits (33). As it was, San Diego finished with 21 runs and 24 hits. “You feel for a lot of people, right?” Rockies general manager Bill Schmidt told reporters even before his franchise’s loss on Saturday, per MLB.com. “Because there are a lot of people that care. You keep trying to grind through it. That’s all you can do. “I know we’re better than we’ve played. We’re not good right now. We’re going to have to battle through it and come out on the other side.” The Rockies have been hobbled by injuries to key players like 2024 Gold Glove shortstop Ezequiel Tovar and former NL MVP Kris Bryant. “We’ve got to get guys back. That’s the big thing. Try to withstand the storm,” Schmidt added. Their losses this season have been so lopsided that they have allowed 134 more runs than they’ve scored, 65 worse than the next closest team in MLB. The Rockies’ struggles come after the Chicago White Sox lost 121 games last season, setting the unwanted record of the most losses in a single season in baseball’s modern era. At the moment, the Rockies are on track to surpass even that tally though, of course, there is still a long way to go.",

    "content": "The Indiana Pacers emphatically pushed the top-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers to the brink of elimination with a dominant 129-109 win to take a 3-1 series lead. After a chastening 22-point defeat at home in Game 3, a determined Pacers squad flew out of the gates and was 15 points up after the opening quarter. By the end of the second quarter, the lead hit 41, tying the largest halftime lead in NBA playoff history. The Pacers’ 80 first-half points also set a new franchise playoff record for points scored in a half, per Reuters. The Cavaliers had no answer for Indiana’s blistering offense and their hopes were further dashed when star guard Donovan Mitchell was forced to sit out the entire second half with an ankle injury. Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson, who said Mitchell will undergo an MRI on Monday, candidly described Sunday’s game as “complete domination” by the Pacers. “It’s kind of the story in every facet. It wasn’t like tactics or anything. They dominated us in every facet of the game,” he said. The Pacers were without Bennedict Mathurin, a consistent source of points off the bench in this series, for most of the game after he was ejected for a flagrant 2 foul in the opening quarter. Three Pacers players scored at least 20 points; Pascal Siakam had a joint game-high 21 to go with six rebounds, Miles Turner had 20 and seven rebounds, and Obi Toppin had 20 points. In total, seven Pacers players scored in double figures. “We haven’t done anything yet,” Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said, per the Associated Press. “We’re going to keep approaching this like we have everything to prove. We know people don’t believe in us, so we’re just going to stay in the fight and keep fighting.” However, it was another quiet night for Tyrese Haliburton, who had just 11 points on 3-of-8 shooting after scoring just four points on 2-of-8 shooting two nights earlier. For the Cavaliers, Darius Garland led the way with 21 points to go with six assists. Mitchell finished with 12 points on 3-of-11 shooting before getting subbed out. The series moves to Cleveland for Game 5 on Tuesday where the Pacers can book their ticket to a second straight Eastern Conference Finals appearance. “Don’t believe the hype. Keep rollin,’” Turner told TNT after the game. “We got punched in the mouth last game. We had a hell of a response, the stars set the tone and the bench picked it up the rest of the game.” The Oklahoma City Thunder earned a 92-87 road win over the Denver Nuggets to tie their series at 2-2. It was a game mostly bereft of offensive quality as the two teams began by combining for just 25 points in a grueling first quarter that ended 17-8 to Oklahoma City. But the experienced Nuggets gradually improved somewhat to take an eight-point lead early in the fourth quarter. However, an 11-0 run from the Thunder turned the game on its head and Denver never led again. “We fought. We stayed the course, and then we closed the game,” Thunder star guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said, per AP. The leading candidate in the Most Valuable Player race, Gilgeous-Alexander finished with 25 points, six rebounds, six assists and two steals. Nikola Jokić, Gilgeous-Alexander’s rival to be crowned MVP, had 27 points, 13 rebounds and four steals on the night. Game 5 is in Oklahoma City on Tuesday.",

    "content": "The Dallas Mavericks won the 2025 NBA draft lottery on Monday in Chicago, securing the coveted top overall pick and the right to possibly select star forward next month. Dallas had just a 1.8% chance of receiving the first pick, the fourth lowest odds since the lottery started in 1985. This is the first time the have won the lottery. Dallas will have the opportunity to reset the franchise by adding Flagg after trading Luka Dončić in the middle of this season, which sparked a huge amount of backlash from their fanbase. “It’s been a rough year as you all know,” Rolando Blackman, Mavericks ambassador and four-time NBA All-Star, said in an ESPN interview after the lottery. “We’ll get a chance to move our franchise forward. … It’s really, really a great honor, and it’s an important piece of the puzzle because we want to hoop down in Dallas.” Blackman said that Flagg “can hoop, he can play,” adding, “There’s a lot of great players in that draft class. … We will see how the guys get together and being able to make our team better which is exactly what we want to do.” The Utah Jazz, Washington Wizards and Charlotte Hornets had the best odds at 14% of landing the No. 1 selection. The 18-year-old Flagg cemented himself as one of the top players in college last season as a freshman. Flagg averaged 19.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.4 blocks and 1.2 steals in 37 games for the Blue Devils, who lost in the men’s basketball Final Four to the University of Houston in the final minutes. The first team All-American, who was in attendance at McCormick Place during the event,  said it was an “incredible experience” and is something he has dreamed about since he was a child. The lottery win offers a silver lining to what was a tumultuous season for the Mavericks. Dallas stunned the NBA world when general manager made the shocking decision to trade star player Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers in February. The blockbuster trade left Mavericks fans reeling after the sudden exit of their superstar. The mood became even more bleak in Dallas after a rash of injuries hit several of the Mavs’ most important players. Most notably, Kyrie Irving was lost for the season with a torn ACL in his knee and Anthony Davis – who the Mavericks received in exchange for Dončić – missed significant time with a strained adductor. Dallas was still able to claw their way into the NBA’s play-in tournament, but were eliminated from postseason contention by the Memphis Grizzlies. On whether he thought he could possibly play in Dallas, Flagg said, “I didn’t try to think about it too much. I feel like it’s kind of out of my control. I’m just kind of going through the process like everybody else and just trying to enjoy every single moment because we only get to do this once.” The San Antonio Spurs, Philadelphia 76ers, Hornets and Jazz round out the top five picks in the upcoming draft. The two-day, two-round draft will be held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, on June 25-26. This story has been updated with additional information.",

Late in the fourth quarter, the Celtics forward went down with an apparent non-contact injury as he tried to go after a loose ball. He quickly grabbed his right ankle and appeared to be in a lot of pain. Tatum was helped off the court as he couldn’t put any pressure on his right leg and was taken through the tunnel in New York’s Madison Square Garden in a wheelchair. Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla said after the game Tatum suffered a “lower body injury” and will have the scan on Tuesday. “You are always worried about someone’s health,” Mazzulla told reporters. “He’s the type of guy that gets right up. He didn’t and we’ll know tomorrow exactly what it is. It’s tough to watch a guy like him getting carried off like that.” To make matters worse, Monday’s defeat means the Boston Celtics now trail 3-1 in the series and face elimination in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Down by as many as 14 points in the third quarter, New York ended the period on a 12-2 run to take an 88-85 lead into the fourth. With less than six minutes remaining in regulation of a tied 102-102 game, OG Anunoby drained a three-pointer to give the Knicks a 105-102 lead, which New York would not relinquish. Four Knicks players scored at least 20 points with Jalen Brunson leading the way with 39 points, 12 assists and five rebounds. Mikal Bridges and Karl-Anthony Towns each had 23 points and Anunoby added 20. After the victory, Brunson discussed the comeback win and extending the series lead. “It means a lot. It’s a big game for us, just the way we responded, is what I’m most proud of, sticking together and making sure we are not quitting,” Brunson said at the postgame news conference. “That’s a tough team over there. Obviously, we want to get off to better starts, but they got experience. They’re the defending champs for a reason.” Tatum finished with a game-high 42 points, tying Celtics legends Larry Bird and John Havlicek for the most 40-point postseason games in franchise history. Tatum also had eight rebounds, four assists, four steals and two blocks in 40 minutes. “That’s our brother, hate to see him go down. We know the type of guy he is. It’s tough to see him go down,” Celtics guard Derrick White, who scored 23 points in the loss, said after the game. “We just have to find a way to win Game 5.” Boston guard Jaylen Brown, who finished with 20 points and seven rebounds, said it was “tough” seeing Tatum go down. “Tonight is tough. I think everybody is kind of at a loss of words just because, one losing a game, but obviously, the concern with JT. But we pick our heads back up tomorrow and go from there,” Brown said. Brunson said he’s “praying for the best” for Tatum. “We want to go out there and compete, but when a player of his caliber goes down and he’s rolling in pain like that, you know something is wrong, so that why I gave my thoughts and prayers because you never want to see something like that ever. ” The Knicks will look to eliminate the defending NBA champion Celtics on Wednesday in Boston.",

    "content": "Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum ruptured his right Achilles tendon in Monday night’s playoff game and will be out for an extended period of time after undergoing surgery, the team announced Tuesday. The Celtics said he is expected to make a full recovery. The team did not put a timetable on his return, but full recovery from Achilles injuries can often take months, if not longer. ESPN’s Shams Charania was first to report the news. Tatum’s injury is a tough blow to the defending champions, who are on the brink of elimination in the second round of the NBA playoffs. The New York Knicks have a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series after winning Game 4 at Madison Square Garden. Tatum had put together another incredible season, averaging more than 26 points and eight rebounds per game in the regular season and then ramping up that production in the playoffs. In the first four games of the conference semifinals against the Knicks, Tatum was brilliant. He averaged 33.5 points and seven assists per game as the Celtics were trying to dig out of a 2-0 series deficit by winning Game 4 to even things up. Late in the fourth quarter, the Celtics forward went down with an apparent non-contact injury as he tried to go after a loose ball. He quickly grabbed his right ankle and appeared to be in a lot of pain. Tatum was helped off the court as he couldn’t put any pressure on his right leg and was taken through the tunnel in New York’s Madison Square Garden in a wheelchair. Tatum finished with a game-high 42 points, tying Celtics legends Larry Bird and John Havlicek for the most 40-point postseason games in franchise history. Tatum also had eight rebounds, four assists, four steals and two blocks in 40 minutes. But his team could not overcome the loss of its star player and eventually faded against the Knicks and the boisterous Madison Square Garden crowd. The game finished 121-113 in favor of New York. Boston now must roll off three wins in a row to keep its repeat hopes alive. After the game, Tatum’s injury loomed over players on both teams. “That’s our brother, hate to see him go down. We know the type of guy he is. It’s tough to see him go down,” Celtics guard Derrick White, who scored 23 points in the loss, said. “We just have to find a way to win Game 5.” Boston guard Jaylen Brown, who finished with 20 points and seven rebounds, said it was “tough” seeing Tatum go down. “Tonight is tough.

Tyrese Haliburton, who struggled in Games 3 and 4, posted 31 points, six rebounds and eight assists to lead the Pacers to a 114-105 win and secure the series 4-1. “I’m certainly very excited for our fans, our ownership, our city,” Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle told reporters after the game. “Winning a closeout game on the road is extremely difficult. “We were down 19 and Ty’s run of shot-making in the second quarter got us back into it. “We just had a lot of guys that played extremely hard and we just said: ‘Hey, let’s hang in this thing, try to wear them down and see if we can outlast them,’ and essentially that’s what happened.” The Cavaliers, who lost all three home games in this series, will again be kicking themselves at giving up a big lead as they did in Games 1 and 2 in Cleveland. The Cavs have been plagued by injuries this series, with Darius Garland missing the first two games and star guard Donovan Mitchell sitting the second half of Game 4. Both were back for Tuesday’s Game 5, but it made little difference. Garland was a non-factor, scoring 11 points on 4-of-16 shooting – including 0-of-6 from three – while Mitchell posted a game-high 35 points on an inefficient 8-of-25 shooting night. Mitchell did a lot of his damage from the free throw line; his 21 attempts from the charity stripe were one fewer than the entire Pacers team. When asked about Cleveland’s injuries impacting the series, Carlisle recalled someone recently telling him that “the winning team writes the script.” “I have to give our guys credit, they earned this,” Carlisle said. “This (Cleveland) is one of the best teams in the league, injuries, dings or no dings. They had a great year. I’m sorry their season had to end like this. They kind of had the perfect season, and we then came along and we’re hot at the right time. “We’re talking about eight more wins for an NBA championship,” Carlisle added. “The league is wide open this year, there are a lot of great teams, but it’s wide open. We’ve just got to keep believing, we’ve got a great group of guys who have committed to one another.” While the Pacers get ready to face either the New York Knicks or the Boston Celtics for another shot at reaching the NBA Finals, the Cavs will be left to rue a lost season in which they emerged as the East’s best team over 82 games. It is only the fourth time in NBA history that a team with at least 64 wins in the regular season failed to advance past the second round, per ESPN. “I just couldn’t believe it,” Mitchell said after the defeat. “Didn’t want to believe it. Don’t want to believe it. Still don’t want to believe it. “I love playing in that f**king arena, man. That energy, that crowd. We were 0-3 at home, let the city down. This place is special. This place is really special and we didn’t get it done. “Especially at home, that’s what hurts.” The Knicks and Celtics play Game 5 in Massachusetts on Wednesday, with New York holding a 3-1 series lead and due to a torn Achilles tendon.",

    "content": "on Tuesday removed and – two of the sport’s most famous players who were previously kicked out of baseball for gambling on the game – from the league’s permanently ineligible list. The historic decision by MLB commissioner allows Rose to be considered for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame, an honor that had been ruled out as part of the settlement he reached with Major League Baseball. Rose died in September, and Manfred ruled that his lifetime ban ended with his death. “In my view, once an individual has passed away, the purposes of Rule 21 have been served. Obviously, a person no longer with us cannot represent a threat to the integrity of the game,” Manfred wrote. “Moreover, it is hard to conceive of a penalty that has more deterrent effect than one that lasts a lifetime with no reprieve. “Therefore, I have concluded that permanent ineligibility ends upon the passing of the disciplined individual, and Mr. Rose will be removed from the permanently ineligible list.” Jackson was a member of the Chicago White Sox who were accused of conspiring with gamblers to lose the 1919 World Series on purpose. is among the most infamous in baseball history and Jackson, along with seven of his teammates, was banned for life from MLB by then-commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. The eight members of the White Sox were acquitted of conspiring with gamblers in 1921 but nonetheless were forced away from the game. Jackson always denied ever gambling on the World Series. According to the Shoeless Joe Jackson Museum, he hit for a .375 average in the 1919 World Series, had a then-record 12 hits in the series, drove in six runs, didn’t commit an error and threw out five Cincinnati Reds players. His story was immortalized in the 1989 film “Field of Dreams.” “Regardless of what anybody says, I was innocent of any wrongdoing,” Jackson told the Sporting News in 1942, . “I gave baseball all I had. The Supreme Being is the only one to whom I’ve got to answer. If I had been out there booting balls and looking foolish at bat against the Reds, there might have been some grounds for suspicion. I think my record in the 1919 World Series will stand up against that of any other man in that series or any other World Series in all history.” The full list of players who were removed Tuesday from the permanently ineligible list also includes Eddie Cicotte, Happy Felsch, Chick Gandil, Fred McMullin, Swede Risberg, Buck Weaver, Lefty Williams, Joe Gedeon, Gene Paulette, Benny Kauff, Lee Magee, Phil Douglas, Cozy Dolan, Jimmy O’Connell and William Cox. Felsch, Gandil, Cicotte, Williams, McMullin, Weaver and Risberg were the other members of the White Sox involved in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. Rose, who passed away last year at the age of 83, holds the Major League Baseball record for the number of games played (3,562) and hits (4,256). was first to report the news and CNN has reached out to Rose’s family attorney for comment. After transitioning into a career as a manager, MLB revealed in the spring of 1989 that it was investigating Rose for gambling. Among the accusations was that he gambled on baseball games played by teams he either played for or managed. He later admitted to gambling on games while managing the Cincinnati Reds and said in a 2007 radio interview that he bet on every Reds game while he as manager. In the final years of his life, Rose had attempted multiple times to get reinstated by the league and to be made eligible for induction into the Hall. He tried to get reinstated by the league in 2015 and 2020 but was denied. Rose’s reinstatement and eventual enshrinement were a cause championed by President Donald Trump, among others. Trump said earlier this year he plans to issue a posthumous pardon to Rose. The Reds, Philadelphia Phillies and Montreal Expos player served time in federal prison for tax evasion charges in the early 1990s. “Major League Baseball didn’t have the courage or decency to put the late, great, Pete Rose, also known as ‘Charlie Hustle,’ into the Baseball Hall of fame. Now he is dead, will never experience the thrill of being selected, even though he was a FAR BETTER PLAYER than most of those who made it, and can only be named posthumously. WHAT A SHAME!,” Trump wrote on Truth Social in February. He added, “He never betted against himself, or the other team. He had the most hits, by far, in baseball history, and won more games than anyone in sports history. Baseball, which is dying all over the place, should get off its fat, lazy ass, and elect Pete Rose, even though far too late, into the Baseball Hall of Fame!” CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on Rose. In a statement, National Baseball Hall of Fame chairman of the board Jane Forbes Clark said that players removed from the permanently ineligible list are now able to be considered for enshrinement in Cooperstown, New York. “The National Baseball Hall of Fame has always maintained that anyone removed from Baseball’s permanently ineligible list will become eligible for Hall of Fame consideration. Major League Baseball’s decision to remove deceased individuals from the permanently ineligible list will allow for the Hall of Fame candidacy of such individuals to now be considered,” the statement read. The Phillies welcomed the decision, noting Rose’s impact on the team during the five seasons he played for Philadelphia. Former Phillies great Mike Schmidt called it a “great day for baseball.” Schmidt said, “Congratulations to Pete’s family, his teammates, as well as his supporters who have waited many years for this opportunity for consideration.” This story has been updated with additional information.",

    "content": "The reached their second straight Western Conference Finals as they downed the Golden State Warriors 121-110 to close out a 4-1 series win. The Warriors were again without injured star guard Steph Curry, who hasn’t played since suffering a hamstring strain in the second quarter of Game 1. However, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr didn’t use Curry’s absence as an excuse for his team’s postseason exit, insisting that “injuries are a part of the playoffs.” “There’s no sense in dwelling on it,” he added. “I don’t want to take anything away from what Minnesota just accomplished. No sense in even talking about Steph.” Julius Randle – who is quickly earning the moniker ‘Playoff Julius’ on social media – led the Timberwolves with 29 points on 13-of-18 shooting to go with eight rebounds and five assists. Randle joined the Timberwolves ahead of the season in a big trade that sent Karl-Anthony Towns to the New York Knicks and endured his share of teething pains during his first season in Minnesota. But the three-time All Star is averaging almost 24 points per game in the playoffs and has scored at least 20 points in eight of the Timberwolves’ 10 postseason games so far. “Just how he creates for others and his impact on the game,” Minnesota star guard Anthony Edwards said when asked what stood out about Randle’s performances. “The way he controls the tempo, the way he pushes the pace, the way he brings us along with him when he pushes the pace and even his defense, his defense has gone to another level. “The way he communicates with us, his attention to detail. Everything, man. It’s incredible. It’s incredible to be his teammate and he brings it every night. He shows you that he wants to win, so I’m happy to have him next to me.” Edwards finished with 22 points, seven rebounds, 12 assists and three blocks. Rudy Gobert added 17 points, missing just one of his nine shots, Mike Conley had 16, Jaden McDaniels had 14 and Donte DiVincenzo had 13 points off the bench. Minnesota led by as many as 25 points in the third quarter and managed to hold off a late Warriors run that closed the gap to nine in the fourth. Brandin Podziemski led the Warriors with a playoff career-high 28 points, while Jonathan Kuminga added 26 off the bench. Jimmy Butler had another disappointing night, scoring just 17 points on 4-of-11 shooting. Butler earned the ‘Playoff Jimmy’ nickname for his monumental effort in dragging the Miami Heat to the NBA Finals in 2020 and 2023, but didn’t get close to that level during this postseason. The six-time All Star suffered a pelvis injury after a hard fall in Game 2 of the Warriors’ first-round win over the Houston Rockets, though he insisted he was “good enough to compete.” After losing in five games to the Dallas Mavericks in last season’s Western Conference Finals, the Timberwolves will face either the Oklahoma City Thunder or the Denver Nuggets this time around. OKC and Denver play Game 6 on Thursday night with the Thunder holding a 3-2 series lead. The defending champion Boston Celtics avoided playoff elimination with a 127-102 home win against the New York Knicks to take the series to a Game 6. In Boston’s first game without the injured , who underwent successful surgery on a ruptured Achilles, Derrick White stepped up in his absence with a game-high 34 points, including 7-of-13 from three-point range. It was a back-and-forth game with 11 lead changes until the Celtics pulled away midway through the third quarter. Josh Hart had 24 points for the Knicks while Jalen Brunson added 22. Game 6 is at Madison Square Garden on Friday.",

    "content": "The Indianapolis Colts publicly apologized to Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill for poking fun at his detainment before the first game of the 2024 season in a since-deleted video unveiling the team’s schedule for this season. The Colts posted the video Wednesday as part of the NFL’s schedule release. It’s become popular for teams to make creative videos unveiling schedules in recent years and the Colts’ video played off the video game Minecraft. A film based on the game, “ ,” was released earlier this year and has been a smash hit at the box office. The movie was distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, which, like CNN, is part of Warner Bros. Discovery. In the opening scene of the video posted by the Colts, a dolphin wearing a No. 10 jersey and labeled “Hill” is approached by a Coast Guard boat that has a siren blaring and a police officer on board. “We removed our schedule release video because it exceeded our rights with Microsoft and included an insensitive clip involving Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill. We sincerely apologize to Microsoft and Tyreek,” the Colts said in a statement to . Hill responded to the video on Thursday: “Should’ve left it up @Colts , this was funny.” The incident involving Hill happened just before the Dolphins’ first game of the season last year when the wide receiver was driving to the stadium and was stopped by police. Video of the traffic stop officers pulling Hill out of his car, handcuffing him and placing him face down in the road after he did not immediately comply with their commands. Hill afterward that he wasn’t moving quickly because he was still recovering from a minor knee surgery that took place before the 2024 season. “I was shocked. It was crazy because it all happened so fast. Like for me, it just all happened so fast and I really couldn’t like gather everything that was happening,” Hill told Kaitlan Collins on “The Source” at the time. “I wasn’t moving fast because you know I got injuries, I got things that I go through. I play a physical sport, I’ve been doing this for a moment now man so I’m dealing with some stuff, so I guess the officers they felt like I wasn’t doing it on their timing,” he added. The South Florida Police Benevolent Association defended the actions of the officers involved, highlighting that Hill was never placed under arrest. The association said Hill was not cooperative and that officers were working in the interest of their own safety. Other Miami Dolphins players, who had pulled over to offer assistance to Hill, were also treated aggressively. Calais Campbell, a former Walter Payton Man of the Year award winner, told reporters he was placed in handcuffs by police after he approached the scene and tried to talk with officers about what as taking place. Bystanders and police body-worn cameras captured the September 8 incident. Hill was issued two citations stemming from the stop outside Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. He had previously pleaded not guilty to careless driving and not wearing a seatbelt. A judge dismissed the citations in November after the officer involved in the stop didn’t show up in court. The Colts and Dolphins will play in Week 1 of the NFL season in Indianapolis.",

The Thunder trailed by 11 points late in the first quarter at Oklahoma City’s Paycom Center and were down 26-21 after the period. But the Thunder roared back and took control of the game, leading by 14 points at the half and 25 after the third quarter. Thunder superstar guard Gilgeous-Alexander scored a game-high 35 points on 12-of-19 shooting. It was his seventh 30+ point game in the postseason this season, the most in the league. After the game, Gilgeous-Alexander said the series win means a lot for the city and fans. “They’ve been so good all year. They’ve been behind us through good and bad. It feels like no team in the league has homecourt advantage like we do,” he said. “We’ve been a better team because of them, having them behind us. To know that if we didn’t bring it tonight it could be over for them as well wasn’t fair.” Oklahoma City forward Jalen Williams finished with 24 points, five rebounds and seven assists as the Thunder won the Western Conference semis four games to three. OKC head coach Mark Daigneault was impressed with his team’s Game 7 performance. “There’s not many games that you wake up in the morning and you know that you’re going to remember the game for the rest of your life and Game 7 is one of them,” Daigneault told reporters after the victory. “It’s really a distraction, distraction from the fact that it’s still a basketball game. To be able to focus through that and perform the way these guys did today was very impressive.” Denver committed 22 turnovers and struggled from the three-point line, converting just 10-of-45 from beyond the arc. Nuggets superstar center Nikola Jokić, a three-time regular season MVP and finalist for this year’s award, finished with 20 points, nine rebounds and seven assists in the loss. “Everybody, even in the first round thought the (Los Angeles) Clippers going to beat us,” Jokić said at the postgame news conference. “We’ve always found a way, except tonight. We’ve found a way to win a game. We’ve found a way to win a series and today wasn’t the case.” He added: “We’ve played a seven-game series against probably the best team in the NBA. We’ve had opportunities. We’ve had chances.” OKC will next face the Minnesota Timberwolves, led by star guard Anthony Edwards, starting Tuesday night in Oklahoma City.",

Minnesota ended a hard-fought but shoddy first half with a four-point lead, but a second-half blitz from the Thunder, who outscored their opponents by 30 points across the third and fourth quarters, blew the Timberwolves away. After a rough start offensively – a theme throughout the team – Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 20 of his game-high 31 points in the second half to lead the Thunder to the win, also adding five rebounds, nine assists and three steals. “We try to play to our identity,” Gilgeous-Alexander, who missed 11 of his 13 shots in the first half, told reporters. “We did a good job of that on defense. Our defense definitely gave us life early in the game and kept us in it. “I was just out there being aggressive, trying to get to my spots; obviously, it wasn’t falling like it usually does and I would like it to, but that’s part of the game. “Nothing really changed in my mindset (in the second half). I just tried to continue to be aggressive, continue to trust my work and it worked out for me.” OKC coach Mark Daigneault said it was a “major victory” to only be down by four points at the break after such a poor first half from his team. “The defense was a huge catalyst in that,” he added. “I just thought it took us a second to calibrate to the opponent, but our defense allowed us the margin to do that.” Jalen Williams, who continues his rapid NBA ascension, had 19 points, eight rebounds, five assists and five steals, while Chet Holmgren added 15 points. The Thunder’s relentless defense stifled the Timberwolves, especially in the second half, and limited Minnesota superstar Anthony Edwards to a meager 18 points on 5-of-13 shooting. Julius Randle continued his impressive postseason form with a team-high 28 points – including 5-of-6 from three – to go with eight rebounds, though he scored just eight of those points in the second half. “I definitely got to shoot more,” Edwards said postgame. “I took 13 f**king shots, but I’ll say probably just get off the ball a little more. Play without the ball. “I think that would be the answer because, playing on the ball, they’re just going to double and sit in the gaps all day. So I’ve got to go watch some film and take it apart – we’ll figure it out.” With less than a minute remaining in the first quarter, Edwards was forced to head to the locker room for treatment after rolling his right ankle on a drive to the basket. However, he returned and played the rest of the game, telling reporters that it didn’t affect him in the second half. Game 2 will be played in Oklahoma City on Thursday.",

The Serb, who is still searching for his 100 career title, was playing his first match on clay since winning gold at the Paris Olympics in July 2024 and struggled to find any rhythm. Djokovic, who recently lost to unseeded teenager in the final of the Miami Open, committed 29 unforced errors compared to just 18 winners in the defeat, which ended a 10-game unbeaten streak on clay. “I expected myself at least to have put in a decent performance. Not like this,” Djokovic said. “This was horrible. I did not have high expectations, really. I knew I’m going to have a tough opponent and I knew I’m going to probably play pretty bad. But this bad, I didn’t expect.” He added: “I was hoping it was not going to happen, but it was quite a high probability I’m going to play this way. I don’t know. Just horrible. A horrible feeling to play this way, and just sorry for all the people that have to witness this.” When asked if he knew why he played like that, Djokovic replied: “I don’t know. I don’t have it. I have it and I don’t have it. I don’t really care.” Tabilo is now 2-0 in his career head-to-head with Djokovic after also recording a straight sets win over the 24-time grand slam champion in their previous meeting at the Italian Open in May 2024. They are the only top-10 wins of Tabilo’s career. Remarkably, the Chilean has struggled for form this season. Tabilo was 2-9 in 2025 arriving in Monte Carlo and on an eight-match losing streak on clay, per the ATP. Tabilo, the world No. 32, will face No. 15 seed Grigor Dimitrov in the third round on Thursday. “It’s been a tough year, so a little bit of the nerves were there, but I just tried to remember what I did well against him last time,” Tabilo said, per the Tennis Channel. “I served well today, which helped me to regroup my game after that first game, and it was an unreal match, I think. Match by match I’ve been getting better, and I’m so happy.”",

    "title": "\n      Tennis great Stan Smith laments the sport battling ‘a lot of the same issues we had back 50 years ago’ following PTPA lawsuit\n    ",

    "publication_date": "2025-04-12T09:00:37.389Z",

    "content": "Former world No. 1 Stan Smith tells it is “unfortunate” that tennis seems to be experiencing “a lot of the same issues we had back 50 years ago.” His comments come after the , the players’ association co-founded by Novak Djokovic, filed multiple lawsuits around the world against the sport’s tours and governing bodies. The suits allege the “monopolization” of men’s and women’s tennis and the “disregard” of player interests, accusing the governing organizations of operating “as a cartel.” The ATP and WTA both disagreed with the lawsuit and said in statements they would defend their positions “vigorously.” “It’s unfortunate that you have a group of players that are in the Players’ Association, not only ATP but the WTA,” Smith tells CNN. “The ITF has always been the elephant that has been so powerful but trying to control the game. “So I understand that part, but it’s really unfortunate to see the players not able to work it out. Some of the things they’re asking for have been things that have been improved dramatically, over the conditions of play, certainly the prize money has grown. “There’s concern about the amount of prize money at the major tournaments and that, I think, could be negotiated to a certain extent. “Obviously the ITF, the grand slam events are the ones that have the most money,” Smith adds, “and the players are important to those events, and those events are important to the players. So I hope there’s a compromise there in this whole situation.” Smith spoke to CNN as a part of his tour for his new book “Winning Trust: How To Create Moments That Matter,” which was released last month. Last week, French sports outlet L’Équipe that the top-20-ranked male and female players cosigned a letter to organizers of the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open requesting a “substantial increase” in prize money. Qinweng Zheng, the women’s singles gold medalist at last year’s Paris Olympics, called the letter a “really positive” step for the sport. Smith, who became an icon in both the tennis and fashion world after having an Adidas sneaker named after him, certainly knows a thing or two about player power. In 1968, star tennis players began leaving what was then an amateur sport and defecting to the professional circuit, which meant they would no longer be eligible to compete in the amateur-only grand slams. However, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) eventually relented after much turmoil and the Open Era was born. Five years later, Smith arrived at Wimbledon as the defending champion after winning the title in 1972. It was the pinnacle of his career. Ahead of the tournament in ‘73, the Yugoslav Tennis Association was unhappy with its star player, Niki Pilić, after he opted to play in the professional World Championship of Tennis doubles final rather than represent his country in the Davis Cup. Pilić was suspended for nine months by his country’s tennis association, which then phoned Wimbledon organizers and requested he be banned from competing – a request that was granted. In protest, the players formed the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and 13 of the 16 seeds – including defending champion Smith – withdrew in support of Pilić. However, regarding the recent events in tennis, Smith questions how unifying this lawsuit will be, given many of the world’s top players were not involved – or even aware of it, in the case of world No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz. Djokovic, who wasn’t named in the suit despite co-founding the PTPA, admitted that he agrees and disagrees with parts of the legal action. The Serb said he has previously been “very active in tennis politics” but didn’t sign because he “want(s) other players to step up.” “I think a lot of this could be things that could be worked through, and some of the players like Carlos Alcaraz didn’t know about it,” says Smith, who has recently written the book “Winning Trust” with former professional tennis player Gary Niebur. “So it certainly doesn’t represent all the players. At Wimbledon, we had almost all the top players boycotting. “It was a bond of the ATP at that particular moment. So I think it’s unfortunate that they aren’t able to work through these issues that are out there and a lot of it revolves around schedule. It’s always been schedule. It’s always been prize money. “It’s always been prize money, distribution, allocation. And it’s funny, because it’s a lot of the same issues we had back 50 years ago. “I know that Djokovic is involved. It’s very ironic that he’d be involved in this whole thing, but not be part of the suit. That doesn’t make sense to me. There are other players that are involved, but I don’t know if there’s a unity of the players behind this whole thing, so it’s unfortunate.”",

The Spaniard had to come from behind to defeat Lorenzo Musetti 3-6, 6-1, 6-0 in Sunday’s final, securing his sixth Masters 1000 victory and first since Indian Wells last year. Musetti, who was bidding for the biggest win of his career, was hampered by a leg injury in the final set and finished the match despite struggling to move around the court. For Alcaraz, the win sets him up perfectly for the weeks ahead as he prepares for his French Open title defense next month. “A lot of people have really high expectations of me on having a really good clay season,” the four-time grand slam champion told reporters after the match. “Probably, they want me to win almost every tournament, so it’s kind of a bit difficult to deal with it, I guess. “But one thing I learned over the last month is I have to think about myself … think about my people, my team, my family, my close friends, and no matter what happens on court, if I win, if I lose, I have to leave the court happy and proud with what I’ve done.” Alcaraz can certainly be proud of his achievements in Monte-Carlo this past week and a half, coming from a set down on three occasions to lift the title. He fell 3-1 behind in the first set against Musetti after miscuing a forehand, while the Italian hit seven winners to take an early lead in the match. It didn’t take long, however, for Alcaraz to get back into the contest, breaking Musetti’s serve twice and wrapping up the second set inside an hour and 20 minutes of play. The deciding set was even more one-sided with Musetti clearly struggling with an injury, even after getting treatment at 0-3 down. It meant that Alcaraz could breeze through the closing stages, hitting the winning forehand into an open court with Musetti unable to move freely. “Hopefully, if everything goes well, I will be playing this tournament for the next 10, 15 years, so let’s see if I can get at least one more,” said the 21-year-old. “All I’m thinking about right now is just to enjoy this moment and let’s see in the future.” Alcaraz, who suffered a surprise second-round exit against Belgium’s David Goffin at the Miami Open in his last tournament, jumps above Alexander Zverev to second in the world rankings. Musetti rises from 16th to a career-high 11th in the rankings having defeated top-10 seeds Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alex de Minaur on his way to the final.",

The Danish player won 7-6 (6), 6-2 in Sunday’s final on Pista Rafa Nadal, ending Alcaraz’s nine-matching winning streak in the process. The Barcelona Open trophy is Rune’s fifth ATP Tour title and first since 2023. “It means the world, it was such a great match,” Rune said afterwards. “In the beginning, I was a little bit stressed because Carlos obviously plays big-time tennis. “I had to breathe a lot and find my rhythm. After he broke me, I got more into the match and played my tennis. The first set was a big battle, it was super important to win it and gain the momentum. I’m so proud of myself.” Alcaraz entered the final as the heavy favorite, having established himself as one of tennis’ most dominant clay court and having beaten defending champion Casper Ruud in the quarterfinals. The match was the first tour-level final between two players aged 21-or-under since 2022 and it was Rune who fell behind early on. He was quickly broken by Alcaraz, playing in front of a partisan crowd, but rallied impressively to fight his way back into the . Rune won eight consecutive points to go from being a break down to moving ahead. He had two set points but Alcaraz was able to repel them in brilliant fashion. And having gone to a tie break, it was Rune who came out on top in the first, with Alcaraz hitting his 10th forehand unforced error of the set. “When I got broken in the first set, I thought to myself that I don’t need to hit every shot on the line,” Rune said afterwards. “So I (asked) myself: ‘What did Novak (Djokovic) do when he beat him?’ I played it in my mind, the Olympics final, and tried to play that style, making a lot of balls. I’m very happy with how I stayed composed when it mattered, and I was really brave.” In the second set, Alcaraz took an off-court medical timeout in the third game – twice taking treatment during the match for an ailment on his right leg – and couldn’t regain his rhythm against a pumped-up Rune. Rune saved all four of the break points against him in the second set as the Danish player didn’t drop another game to emphatically claim the Barcelona Open title. With the result, Rune returns to the top 10 of the men’s world rankings.",

    "content": "British No. 1 Jack Draper says doesn’t deserve the “hate he gets” as the Italian nears a return from a . Sinner is currently serving a three-month ban having twice tested positive for banned substance Clostebol, an anabolic steroid, in March last year. The three-time grand slam champion previously when the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) ruled that he wasn’t at fault for the positive tests, accepting that the contamination was caused by a physio applying an over-the-counter spray. However, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) subsequently lodged an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), leading to Sinner accepting a suspension from February 9 to May 4. Draper is a long-time friend of the 2025 Australian Open champion with the pair having met on the junior tour. The world No. 6 recently said he believes it was a simple mistake that led to Sinner testing positive. “I think ­Jannik is a really, really genuine, nice person. And on top of that, he’s obviously an unbelievable player,” Draper BBC Sport and The Guardian in a joint interview at this year’s Madrid Open. “In this situa­tion, I’m sure that he would have ­absolutely zero idea of anything. That’s just the way life goes – sometimes, there’s mistakes.” Sinner will be eligible to play at the Italian Open next month, with the tournament starting on May 7, three days after his ban ends. But his return to the locker room might be met with a mixed reaction, with not everyone satisfied with the way Sinner’s case was handled. The 23-year-old’s ban, for example, meant he didn’t miss a single grand slam event and raised concerns in the sport. Notably, Novak Djokovic that the whole case was “not a good image for our sport” and suggested that many players believe there “is favoritism happening” in regards to anti-doping. Meanwhile, British player Liam Broady told that it felt like the suspension was intended to “impact Jannik’s career as little as possible.” also said she would have been banned for “20 years” and “gotten grand slams taken away” if the same thing had happened to her. She did, though, describe Sinner as a “fantastic personality” and “great for the sport.” An ITIA spokesperson previously told that it approaches each case in the same way, “irrespective of a player’s ranking or status.” In a February statement, Sinner said that he has “always accepted that I am responsible for my team and realize WADA’s strict rules are an important protection for the sport I love.” And, for Draper, his relationship with Sinner has not been changed by the controversy which has seemingly divided the tennis world. “In terms of actually how I feel about him as a person, I think it’s important for people to know and recognize that the guy’s very, very kind-hearted and a good human being,” Draper added. “So he doesn’t deserve any of the hate that he gets.” Sinner won this year’s Australian Open and will be looking to win his first French Open title as the clay court season gets underway. Draper and Sinner have practiced together in recent weeks, with the childhood friends meeting up in Monte Carlo as the Italian prepares for his return to the court. The British star told BBC Sport and The Guardian that he didn’t speak much about the doping ban with Sinner, instead opting to focus on the tennis. “He’s obviously had a bit of time off, but he’s playing at an incredible level still,” Draper said. “I’m looking forward to having him back on the tour because I think his presence has been missed. It was great to be with him for a few days and get some good sparring.”",

    "content": "Alex Zverev was given a warning for unsportsmanlike conduct after using his phone to take a photo of a disputed ball mark in the middle of his 2-6, 7-6(3), 7-6(0) win over Spain’s Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. In the 10th game of the second set, Zverev was left bemused after a backhand from Davidovich Fokina was called in by the electronic line calling system. After unsuccessfully protesting to umpire Mohamed Lahyani that the ball had actually landed out and there was a “malfunction in the system,” Zverev grabbed his phone and took a photo of the ball mark. Zverev, the No. 1 seed in Madrid, later posted the photo on his Story with the caption: “Just going to leave this one here. This was called in. Interesting call.” The ball mark in the photo posted by Zverev clearly appears to be three or four centimeters wide of the line with the electronic system seeming to deem a line swept into the clay as the edge of the court instead of the permanent white line. While electronic line calling has been gradually implemented on grass and hard courts in recent years, clay-court tournaments have continued to use line judges and, for contested calls, umpires coming down to check the mark. However, this season, the ATP has removed line judges from all events, while the WTA has also removed them from many of its tournaments. The one exception is next month’s French Open, which will continue using line judges for now. It is just the latest incident involving the electronic line calling system this season after world No. 1 was also given a warning for taking a photo of a disputed ball mark at the Stuttgart Open just over a week ago. And it wasn’t even the first such incident at this week’s Madrid Open, with former world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka also posting a photo of disputed mark on social media after her first-round loss to Olga Danilović. Zverev, who is aiming to win the Madrid Open for a third time, will face Argentina’s No. 20 seed Francisco Cerúndolo in the round of 16 on Tuesday.",

It was Djokovic’s first win on clay since he secured gold at the Paris Olympics in August to complete the career singles Golden Slam: winning all four grand slam singles events and the Olympic singles gold medal. The Serbian star was dominant throughout – never facing a break point – and his performance was a stark improvement on recent first-round exits in Monte-Carlo and Madrid. “My first win this season on clay, obviously it’s great to break the ice in a way,” Djokovic said in his on-court interview. “It’s a very demanding surface. “We all know how tricky it is to play on clay, compared to the other surfaces you always have to expect an extra one or two shots, balls coming back. “Here there is a bit more altitude so it helps in you have a good serve, and today, I think that was my strongest shot. I had a very high percentage of first serves, a lot of free points on the first serve when I needed to get myself out of trouble. “It makes life on court a bit easier. Very glad to be able to play the best tennis when it was most needed. All the way through ‘til the last moment I was quite focused and pleased with my level of tennis. Hopefully, that can continue tomorrow.” The 24-time grand slam singles champion, who turned 38 on Thursday, is still bidding to win his 100th ATP title. Djokovic, who parted ways with coach last week, came into Geneva on a three-match losing streak after defeat in the final of the Miami Open, and those first-round losses in Monte-Carlo and Madrid. The No. 2 seed in Geneva, Djokovic will face Italy’s Matteo Arnaldi – the man who beat him in Madrid – on Thursday for a place in the semifinals. The victory, but more so his vastly improved performance, will likely be of great relief to Djokovic ahead of the French Open, which begins on Sunday, as the Serb aims to win a coveted 25th grand slam singles title.",

    "content": "Both and continued to live in their own parallel worlds as both English teams reached the Europa League final on Thursday. The pair will meet in Bilbao, Spain, on May 21 in the hope of salvaging their seasons, with both suffering staggeringly bad form in the Premier league. Tottenham currently sits 16th in the table having lost 19 times this season, while Manchester United is in 15th having won just four league games since the turn of the year. Europe, then, has provided sanctuary for the otherwise beleaguered clubs and offers both a chance to lift the Champions League trophy next year – the winner of the Europa League qualifies for the continent’s top club competition. The Athletic's Tottenham correspondent Jay Harris joins World Sport's Don Riddell to discuss their Europa League semifinal victory, as well as what we can expect from their final against Manchester United. Along with the prestige of playing in the Champions League, participating in next year’s tournament will also provide both clubs with a big financial boost and help attract the world’s best players to help bolster their squads. It’s a prize, then, that neither can afford to miss out on. In truth, both teams breezed into the final having each won their semifinal first legs last week, meaning the return fixtures on Thursday were relatively routine. Manchester United, which held a 3-0 lead, did initially go behind at Old Trafford through Mikel Jauregizar’s wonderful strike but recovered well to win 4-1 on the night, courtesy of goals from Casemiro, Rasmus Højlund and a brace from the impressive Mason Mount. “It’s a different competition and the opponents are different, the physicality I think is important. We are more comfortable in this kind of game,” Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim after the game, trying to explain why his team’s form is so much better in the Europa League. “I do think the games are completely different … when we arrived at the beginning in our club, I think it was more the physicality and the speed of the game, so we were more comfortable to play in the Europa League.” Meanwhile, Tottenham traveled to the Arctic Circle to play Norweigan side , looking to protect its 3-1 first-leg lead. It dealt with the unusual surroundings well on Thursday to win 2-0 on the night, with goals from Dominic Solanke and Pedro Porro ensuring safe passage to the final. For Spurs, there is the added pressure of winning the club’s first trophy since 2008 and first continental silverware since the 1983-84 season. The north London club has struggled to shake off the reputation of being “nearly good enough” over the last decade and has another chance to right that wrong in the final. Spurs manager Ange Postecoglou will also want to back up his claim that he always wins a trophy in the second season after joining a new club. “It’s exciting. It’s brilliant. We know, irrespective of which club you’re at, you don’t get these opportunities too often, so you want to make the most of them,” Postecoglou to reporters after Thursday’s win. “We’ve a couple of weeks to prepare for it, it should be a great game, and obviously, it gives our supporters some hope now that we can do something special this year.” Before this tournament kicked off, many had predicted both teams would have made the final given their superiority over most of the other teams in Europe’s second tier competition. But given how unfathomably poor their league forms have been, it’s quite incredible that teams positioned so low in the Premier League table are competing in a European final. The hope, for both sets of players, is that victory in Bilbao can be the ultimate distraction from their misgivings in the league, and give their respective fans something to cheer about in an otherwise chastening season.",

    "content": "The Women’s World Cup will expand to 48 teams for the 2031 edition of the tournament, which could be hosted by the United States. The FIFA Council unanimously decided to expand the tournament from 32 teams to 48 in 2031, bringing it in line with the men’s World Cup as it expands to 48 teams in the 2026 tournament. The 48-team tournament will have 12 groups and will feature 104 matches, expanded from 64. The tournament will also be one week longer to accommodate the expanded schedule and number of teams. “This is not just about having 16 more teams playing in the FIFA Women’s World Cup but taking the next steps in relation to the women’s game in general by ensuring that more FIFA Member Associations have the chance to benefit from the tournament to develop their women’s football structures from a holistic point of view,” FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in a statement. “The FIFA Women’s World Cup 2023, the first in which teams from all confederations won at least one game and teams from five confederations reached the knockout stage, among many other records, set a new standard for global competitiveness. This decision ensures we are maintaining the momentum in terms of growing women’s football globally.” Infantino said last month look set to host the 2031 and 2035 Women’s World Cups when the decision is formally made next year. The US and UK were the only nations to meet the first deadline in the contest to host those respective tournaments in early April. The next Women’s World Cup, the last with the 32-team format, will be held in Brazil in 2027. FIFA also announced its strategy for action regarding women’s soccer in Afghanistan, which envisions the creation of an Afghan women’s refugee team. The council mandated FIFA administrators must help begin operations as soon as possible to make the Afghan women’s refugee team a reality. “This is a landmark initiative,” Infantino said in his statement. “FIFA is committed to giving every girl the possibility to play football.” It’s a major moment for Afghan women as FIFA’s plan represents a different stance than the Taliban, which has banned women from participating in sports and do not recognize female Afghan national teams. Khalida Popal, a founding member of the Afghan’s women’s soccer team, told CNN she’s proud to be a members of FIFA’s first refugee soccer team. “We are happy that FIFA has created a pathway for Afghan players to finally return to the field,” she told CNN’s Amanda Davies, “but remain hopeful FIFA can amend its Statutes to provide official recognition for our players as the Afghanistan Women’s National Team.”",

    "content": ", one of the most decorated coaches in soccer, will be the new manager of , the country’s federation announced Monday. The 65-year-old, who is currently the manager of Spanish giant Real Madrid, will start his new role on May 26 after the conclusion of the La Liga season, according to the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF). “He is the greatest coach in history and now he is leading the greatest national team on the planet. Together, we will write new glorious chapters for Brazilian football,” Ednaldo Rodrigues, president of the CBF, said in a . Ancelotti has won 15 trophies over two spells at Real Madrid, including the La Liga and double last season. However, the club looks likely to finish this season without a major trophy and was beaten 4-3 by fierce rival Barcelona in El Clásico on Sunday. Real Madrid’s last league game of the season is on May 25, the day before Ancelotti officially starts his new job. Speculation is rife that current Bayer Leverkusen manager Xabi Alonso – who announced that he was and played for under Ancelotti in his first spell at the club – is set to take over for the legendary Italian. Meanwhile, Brazil is currently ranked fifth in the world but has failed to impress during recent tournaments. The was beaten by Croatia in the quarterfinals of the last World Cup in 2022, a tournament won by rival Argentina, and also disappointed in last year’s Copa América after being knocked out by Uruguay in the quarterfinal stage. The team’s last manager, Dorival Júnior, was sacked in March after a run of bad results which left Brazil in fourth place in CONMEBOL’s World Cup qualifying table. “Bringing Carlo Ancelotti to lead Brazil is more than a strategic move. It is a statement to the world that we are determined to reclaim the top spot on the podium,” Rodrigues added. As an Italian, Ancelotti will be the first foreign coach of the Brazilian national team, according to the CBF. In its statement, the federation called its incoming manager an “icon” and thanked Real Madrid for allowing Ancelotti to leave his contract early – it was due to run out in 2026. Madrid is yet to comment publicly about Ancelotti’s future. Ancelotti’s first game as Brazil manager will be against Ecuador in early June, before his team faces Paraguay later that month. The main focus, though, will be on next year’s World Cup which is set to be co-hosted by Mexico, Canada and the US.",

    "content": "Nottingham Forest striker Taiwo Awoniyi has reportedly been placed into an induced coma following “urgent” surgery for a serious abdominal injury suffered during a Premier League match over the weekend. Awoniyi collided with the post during Forest’s 2-2 draw with Leicester City on Sunday but, despite being clearly hampered after the incident, remained on the pitch for the final 10 minutes of the . Forest that the Nigerian striker was “recovering well” following surgery on a “serious abdominal injury.” British media, including the and , reported that Awoniyi had been placed in an induced coma in hospital as part of the recovery process. When reached by CNN, Nottingham Forest pointed to its Tuesday statement and declined to comment further. Awoniyi sustained his injury as he tried to connect with a cross from Anthony Elanga. The 27-year-old stretched to make contact with the ball in an attempt to score, but in his efforts, collided with the frame of the goal; it later turned out that Elanga had been offside but the sideline official didn’t raise their flag until after Awoniyi had struck the post. Awoniyi received lengthy treatment on the afterwards but was deemed OK to continue – Forest made its final permitted substitution after Awoniyi signaled he was fit to remain playing – despite being in clear discomfort. According to Forest’s Tuesday statement, the decision to allow Awoniyi to remain on the pitch after evaluation from medical staff is what sparked a heated discussion on the field between the club’s owner, Evangelos Marinakis, and manager, Nuno Espírito Santo – an incident which had drawn criticism from pundits and social media – after the draw which left the club’s Champions League qualification hopes in the balance. Espírito Santo said after the match that Marinakis was enquiring about the decision from the club’s medical staff to allow Awoniyi to continue rather than anything related to the performance of the team. In Tuesday’s sternly-worded statement, Forest dismissed comments that Marinakis had confronted Espírito Santo as “fake news.” “The truth of the matter is there was no confrontation, with Nuno or with others, either on the pitch or inside the stadium,” Forest said. “There was only shared frustration between all of us that the medical team should never have allowed the player to continue. “We urge former coaches and players, and other public figures in the game, to resist the urge to rush to judgement and fake news online, especially when they do not have the full facts and context.” Forest called the reaction to Marinakis and Espírito Santo’s on-field discussion “baseless and ill-informed outrage for the purposes of personal social media traction.” Since joining Forest from Union Berlin in Germany in 2022, Awoniyi has 17 goals in 73 Premier League appearances for the club.",

    "content": "Angel City defender has undergone successful heart surgery, the club confirmed Tuesday, after she collapsed during a National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) match on Friday. The 20-year-old fell to the ground in the 74th minute of Angel City’s game against the Utah Royals and was attended to by medical personnel, who appeared to administer CPR. Around 10 minutes after collapsing, King was stretchered off the field with an oxygen mask on her face with some visibly distressed. , Angel City said King had been transported to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on Saturday. After undergoing tests, it was discovered that King had a heart abnormality and underwent successful surgery to address it. “She is now resting and recovering surrounded by her family, and her prognosis is excellent,” Angel City said. King’s family also released its own statement, thanking the medical staff for their care. “On behalf of our entire family, along with Savy, we have been so moved by the love and support from Angel City players, staff, fans and community, as well as soccer fans across the country,” they said. “We are blessed to share Savy is recovering well and we are looking forward to having her home with us soon. “We want to thank the incredible Angel City medical staff and players who acted swiftly as well as the medical teams that have given her such exceptional care. We will never forget the kindness and care you’ve shown, our gratitude is endless.” After Friday’s game – which Angel City won 2-0 with goals from Christen Press and Alyssa Thompson – both sets of players joined each other in a circle to offer a prayer for King. Although some appeared affected by King’s collapse, the match resumed after King was taken off the field, a decision which was questioned by Utah head coach Jimmy Coenraets. King – who was selected by Bay FC with the second overall pick in the 2024 NWSL draft – has started all eight games for Angel City this season, having joined the club in February. Prior to entering the NWSL, she played for the University of North Carolina and made multiple appearances for the US youth at the under-17 and under-20 levels.

    "content": "Entrepreneur and Reddit co-founder has continued his investment into women’s sport by purchasing a minority stake in English soccer club FC Women. The 42-year-old, who will now sit on the board, announced the deal on Thursday, saying he was “proud” to help this “iconic club” to become the most popular Women’s Super League (WSL) team in the US. Chelsea is already one of the most successful teams in women’s soccer and recently secured its sixth consecutive league title – without losing a single game. The team is now on the hunt for a domestic treble which it can complete when it faces Manchester United in the Women’s FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium on Sunday. “These players are rewriting the game. Undefeated season. Eyes on the treble. But this isn’t just about winning titles. It’s about finally matching their talent with the resources, visibility, and respect they deserve,” Ohanian, who is married to tennis legend , said on . “I’ve been right about this before and I couldn’t be more excited.” British media on Wednesday that Ohanian had purchased a 10% share of the club worth more than $26 million. It was a figure he appeared to confirm by screenshotting a photo of an article which referenced that figure. Chelsea confirmed the new investment in a on Thursday, saying that Ohanian brought with him “a wealth of experience, energy and passion for women’s sports that will help take Chelsea Women to the next level and shine a light on the potential of the sport here in the UK.” The club did not confirm details around the deal, but has reached out to the club for comment. In his statement on social media, Ohanian also praised Chelsea Women’s new CEO Aki Mandhar. “Her integrity and focus on a standard of excellence were a huge factor in why this was such a ‘Hell Yes’-type investment,” he added. It’s not the first time that Ohanian has invested in women’s soccer. In 2022, he was the founding investor of , a Los Angeles-based team that now plays in the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) – the top division of women’s soccer in the US. The club then became the most valuable women’s professional sports team in the world after a in 2024. Ohanian also founded , a women’s-only track and field event that debuted last year. The event offers $60,000 for race winners and aims to champion female athletes across the world.",

    "content": "South Korean police have arrested two people over the alleged blackmail of Tottenham Hotspur captain and soccer superstar Son Heung-min, according to South Korean’s Yonhap news agency, after reports a woman threatened him with a pregnancy claim. Son, 32, had filed a police complaint against a woman and a man for blackmail and threatening to spread “false information,” his agency, Son & Football Limited, said on Thursday. “We will take strong legal action without leniency to punish those who have made threats of blackmail with obvious false information,” the agency said in a statement on its website. The Gangnam Police Station in southern Seoul said it was investigating a woman in her 20s and a man in his 40s on charges of attempted extortion after receiving Son’s complaint last week, according to Yonhap. The woman allegedly approached Son last June, claiming she was pregnant with his child and demanded money in exchange for her silence, Yonhap reported, citing police. She reportedly sent Son an ultrasound image and received 300 million Korean Won ($215,180), the news agency said. The man, believed to be an acquaintance of the woman, also allegedly tried to blackmail Son in March, demanding 70 million Korean Won ($50,200), Yonhap reported. He did not reportedly receive any money, Yonhap said. CNN has reached out to the Gangnam Police Station. Police arrested the woman Wednesday evening local time for blackmail and the man for an attempted blackmail. Authorities raided the two individuals’ homes and secured their phones for further investigation, according to Yonhap. “Son Heung Min is an obvious victim of this incident,” the soccer star’s agency said. “We apologize once again for worrying everyone supporting Son Heung-min with such a scandalous issue,” the agency wrote. Son is hugely popular in his home country, South Korea, and has become known as of all time. Son started playing football as a child in Chuncheon, located about 46 miles northeast of Seoul, under his father’s supervision. In 2009, he was chosen to join a prestigious youth training academy in Germany, where he eventually made his professional debut at the age of 18. He joined Tottenham from Bayer Leverkusen in August 2015 and has since been breaking records set by his role models Park Ji-sung, the first Korean to play in the Premier League and only Asian player to win the men’s Champions League, and Cha Bum-kun, who played over 300 matches in the Bundesliga for Eintracht Frankfurt and Leverkusen from 1979 to 1989. Son has broken records for the most goals scored by a Korean player in a season in a European league. He also became the first Asian footballer to win the Premier League’s Golden Boot with 23 goals in the season – level with Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah in 2022. On Sunday, Son returned to play against Crystal Palace after being out for a month with a foot injury. Spurs fans will hope he’ll feature in the later this month against Manchester United, with Tottenham looking to win its first trophy since 2008.",

    "content": "is still finding new ways to impress this season after the 17-year-old scored a stunning goal to lead Barcelona to the La Liga title on Thursday. The Catalan club knew it would clinch its 28th league title with a win against local rival Espanyol and duly obliged with a 2-0 victory. Photographer Joan Monfort captured the image of the Lionel Messi and an infant Yamine Lamal in 2007,  the photo now going viral after both player's run to major finals. Who knew Lamal would be the breakout start of Euro 2024? It means fierce rival Real Madrid will no longer be able to catch Barcelona despite both teams still having two more league games to play. Teenager wonder Yamal was yet again at the center of things, scoring a scorching effort to open proceedings and then providing the assist for his team’s second goal. His goal in the 53rd minute was simply sensational and is becoming somewhat of a feature of his game. The youngster picked the ball up on the right-wing before cutting inside and rifling a shot into the top corner of the net. “I always try my best and today I was lucky it went in,” Yamal said, per the . “I am very happy I could help the team and celebrate it.” It was Yamal’s eighth league goal of the season and yet another moment for his rapidly growing highlights reel. He then turned provider later in the match by poking a pass through to Fermín López who doubled Barcelona’s lead late in added time. Having already won Copa del Rey and the Spanish Super Cup, the league title completes a domestic treble for Barcelona in manager Hansi Flick’s first season in charge of the club. The achievement will go someway to healing the wounds left by its dramatic Champions League exit earlier this month, after Inter Milan staged a to knock Barcelona out of the semifinals. “Barcelona has to win titles and three titles is really great,” Flick said, per AP. “I suffered a bit after the game in Milan, but after winning three titles I am very happy and the club is too.” Thursday’s match in Barcelona was temporarily paused in the first half due to an incident outside the stadium. At least 13 people were injured when a outside the stadium, according to local authorities. Catalan Police described the incident as an “accidental collision” to CNN on Thursday.",

    "content": "Crystal Palace has won its first major trophy after beating Manchester City 1-0 in the FA Cup final on Saturday. For Manchester City and Pep Guardiola, the final loss represents a first trophyless season since the 2016-17 campaign. Oliver Glasner’s side took the lead in the first half at Wembley Stadium in London when Eberechi Eze finished off a customary Crystal Palace counterattack. Manchester City piled on the pressure for the remainder of the game and will regret passing on missed opportunities throughout – including a missed penalty from Omar Marmoush. Crystal Palace took the lead in the 16th minute with a free-flowing goal its fans have grown accustomed to seeing during Glasner’s time in charge of the club. The South London team went from back-to-front in lightning speed with a trademark counterattack. Jean-Philippe Mateta held the ball up on the halfway line before finding full-back Daniel Muñoz galloping down Palace’s right-hand side with one of his customary bursts. Muñoz looked up before delivering a low cross into the Manchester City box which found the onrushing Eze perfectly. The 26-year-old then swept the ball into the far corner of the net and sent the Crystal Palace fans into a state of delirium. Manchester City dominated before the goal and continued to pile on the pressure at 1-0 down. Guardiola’s team was soon rewarded for its constant pressure when Bernardo Silva was brought down by Tyrick Mitchell in the Crystal Palace penalty area. Marmoush stepped up to take the spot kick for Manchester City but saw his penalty brilliantly saved by Dean Henderson in the Palace goal. Crystal Palace went in at the halftime break with a 1-0 lead, knowing it was 45 minutes from making history. The second half saw more of the same with Crystal Palace defending doggedly to prevent a Manchester City equalizer. Henderson continued to prove his worth in the Palace net, thwarting Manchester City efforts on countless occasions. As time ran out, Manchester City ran out of ideas and Crystal Palace held on to seal a historic win for the club. “It’s special,” matchwinner Eze told BBC Sport after the game. “I don’t even know what to say.” Crystal Palace came into the game as heavy underdogs. The club had never won a major trophy in its long history and was facing a side which has dominated English football in recent years. Manchester City has won the Premier League six times since the 2017-18 season, alongside a host of other major honors. But this Crystal Palace team did not let the history books distract them from the task at hand. “I think that’s what’s amazing is that we can do something nobody in Crystal Palace history has done,” Crystal Palace defender Chris Richards told prior to the final. And Crystal Palace did just that, making history thanks to Eze’s goal. The American defender also told Lewis of Eze’s importance to the team. “He does things out here that nobody would expect – I don’t even have the creativity in my brain to think of some of the stuff that he does,” Richards said of his talismanic teammate. “He’s one of those guys who leads by example. He doesn’t have too much to say but when he does say it you understand that it’s probably coming from a good place.” Not only does this win represent a first major honor for Crystal Palace, but the club will now also be playing in Europe for the first time in its history next season. Celebrations of Crystal Palace fans will last deep into the night after breaking its long drought and will surely now continue around the continent next season.",

    "content": "secured an impressive treble with a comfortable 3-0 victory over defending champion in the Women’s final on Sunday afternoon. Two goals from Sandy Baltimore either side of one from Catarina Macário  were enough to complete a domestic sweep for the Blues, who have already won the Women’s Super League and League Cup this season. Baltimore’s first goal came in the 45th minute when Celin Bizet fouled Erin Cuthbert in the area, and the Frenchwoman held her nerve in front of the United fans to convert the penalty. The Red Devils came out for the second half with renewed impetus and had decent chances to level the tie through Elisabeth Terland and Ella Toone. But Chelsea was able to keep its opponent at arm’s length and sealed the victory in the 84th minute when Macário headed home Baltimore’s free kick. The icing on the cake came seven minutes later when Wieke Kaptein seized on a loose pass by Leah Galton and crossed for Baltimore, who coolly flicked the ball around Lisa Naalsund and finished emphatically past goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce. Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian, along with his wife, tennis legend Serena Williams, was in attendance at Wembley after he invested a reported £20 million ($26.6 million) in the club earlier this week. “The sky is the limit,” he told broadcaster BBC Sport at halftime. “You heard our president say this club is unapologetically ambitious – I want to get that tattooed on me. “That is what we’re trying to build here. Not just to be the best team, but the best team in the world and at the forefront of women’s sport. “This will be a billion dollar franchise one day and I hope my dollars, my pounds, can go towards that in a big way and especially back home in America, this is going to be America’s team.” Manchester United minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has faced criticism for a perceived lack of commitment to the women’s team, was not present according to BBC Sport, having also missed last year’s final. It is Chelsea’s sixth FA Cup title and its first since 2023 when it beat Manchester United 1-0 thanks to a goal from Sam Kerr. United beat Tottenham Hotspur 4-0 in last year’s final. The win caps a remarkable first season for manager Sonia Bompastor, who replaced club legend Emma Hayes in the summer after the Englishwoman became head coach of the US Women’s National Team (USWNT). Bompastor had imposed a curfew on the players over the past few weeks but now “the players really deserve (to celebrate),” she told BBC Sport after the game. “We still have one week to practice but we need to enjoy this. To achieve a treble in England, it’s difficult to find the right words to describe that.” It is the second time in the club’s history that it has won a domestic treble, with the first coming in the 2020-21 season. Only Arsenal has achieved the feat on more occasions, having done so five times.",

    "content": "After an incredibly disappointing domestic season, the was seen as a chance for salvation for – a ray of light in a dark campaign. But after Wednesday’s defeat in Bilbao to fellow Premier League bottom-dweller , what does the future hold for the club and, in particular, manager ? Wednesday’s result caps off a historically poor season for United, missing out on the Champions League next year as a result and the substantial financial windfall that comes with it. Amorim, who was hired by the club in November after the firing of , has overseen the team’s slide down the Premier League table. The currently sitting 16th, far outside the European qualification positions, and suffering a club-record 18 defeats along the way, the most in a single campaign since the Premier League was launched in 1992. Not to mention, the club is on course for its worst-ever finish. The Europa League final offered United – and similarly Spurs – a chance to redeem an underwhelming campaign with a trophy and a spot in European soccer’s top club competition, but defeat brings into focus how much work needs to be done during the offseason. Despite only being hired six months ago, Amorim faced questions from the media about his own future at the club after defeat in Spain, refusing to rule out leaving if the owners decide he isn’t the right man for the job. “I have nothing to show to the fans,” the Portuguese manager told reporters. “So, in this moment it is a little bit of faith. Let’s see. I am always open. If the board and fans feel I am not the right guy, I will go the next day without any conversation about compensation. “But I will not quit. I am really confident in my job. And as you see, I will not change anything in the way I do things.” While Amorim was uncertain about his future, he appears to have the support of United’s , with two of the senior members of the squad voicing their support for him. Left-back Luke Shaw said Amorim is “100% the right man” for the United manager job and star midfielder Bruno Fernandes concurred. “I don’t think what happened this season shows exactly what he is as a manager,” Fernandes . “Obviously, the results always talk louder, but I do think he’s the right manager for the future of this club.” The mood was understandably somber among United’s players and coaches after the defeat Wednesday night, as their last chance to salvage any glimmer of positivity from a disappointing season slipped away. Many key players took the opportunity to reflect on the poor campaign, with England international Shaw apologizing for the team’s performances throughout the year. “It’s hard to put into words, the season, but I think for a club like Manchester United, it’s not really good enough,” Shaw told reporters. “I think definitely me and I think all of us have to question ourselves tonight. Are we good enough to be here? Because this club, this season, it’s not acceptable. “We know that and it’s down to us. I think we have to look at ourselves. Something has to change.” One thing that will likely change over the summer will be the squad. There are some players whose contracts are expiring – Victor Lindelöf and ’s deals run out this year – while there are others who have been linked with moves away. Argentina winger Alejandro Garnacho has been linked with a move and speculation will only increase after he expressed frustration after Wednesday’s final, saying: “Obviously, it’s hard for everyone. Our season was sh*t. We didn’t beat anyone in the league. We lacked a lot of things. “Until we reached the final, I played every round. And I played 20 minutes today – I don’t know. I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.” Similarly, 20-year-old midfielder Kobbie Mainoo has reportedly attracted interest from other and could be on the move. Even United captain Fernandes has been linked away from the north of England, with clubs in Saudi Arabia reportedly sniffing around a transfer. Fernandes has been one of the shining lights for United over recent years, despite the club’s poor form, but even he admitted he could move this summer if the board decides to “cash in.” “I’ve always said I will be here until the club says to me that it’s time to go,” the 30-year-old said, . “I’m eager to do more, to be able to bring the club to great days. In the day that the club thinks that I’m too much or it’s time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. “But I’ve always said it and I keep my word in the same way. If the club thinks it’s time to part ways because they want to do some cash in or whatever, it’s what it is, and football sometimes is like this.” There appears to be a cloud hanging over Manchester United – its final game of the season at home to Aston Villa on Sunday is sure to be a morose affair – and it appears a lot of work is needed for the to return to the heights of years past.",

Mbappé might have said no to the offer in July, but a month later, said yes to Al-Hilal, as the Brazil star moved from PSG for a transfer fee of around $98.5 million (€90 million) plus add-ons, according to multiple reports. In a record-breaking transfer window, Saudi Pro League (SPL) clubs spent close to $1 billion, acquiring 94 overseas players from Europe’s major leagues – France’s Ligue 1, Spain’s La Liga, Italy’s Serie A, Germany’s Bundesliga and the English Premier League – according to Deloitte. Despite the Arab nation’s poor human rights record, to turn its domestic soccer league into a star-studded, bona fide competition shows the seriousness of its ambition. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says he doesn’t “care” about the country’s investment in sport being described as sportswashing. “Well if sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by one percent, then I will continue doing sportswashing,” MBS said in an with Fox News which aired Wednesday. Pressed on if he was bothered by the use of the term, MBS continued: “I don’t care. I have one percent GDP growth from sport, and I am aiming for another one and a half percent. Call it whatever you want, we’re going to get that one and a half percent.” Saudi clubs, several of which have been taken over by the nation’s sovereign Public Investment Fund (PIF), have already attracted some of the biggest names in the sport. By attracting some of the world’s biggest stars to the Gulf states, the SPL wants “to drive competitiveness on and off the pitch,” though it’s keen to emphasize that these overseas players will help develop “young Saudi talent.” During this summer transfer window, the government-controlled PIF increased the cumulative value of these four clubs nearly five times, making them the most valuable in the country, according to estimates by the sports website Transfermarkt. Plenty of other leading stars have eagerly said yes to the SPL, notably 2022 Ballon D’Or winner Karim Benzema joining Al-Ittihad at the end of his contract with Spanish soccer giant Real Madrid. As the European transfer window came to a close, the four PIF-owned teams have spent nearly $900 million (€835.1 million) on buying elite international players, Transfermarkt data shows, which ranked them in the top 20 clubs in the world by transfer expenditure, alongside soccer giants from England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. Al Hilal alone paid more than $378 million (€353 million), more than PSG and Arsenal, making it the second-largest spender this year. The newly acquired players join five-time Ballon d’Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who has a two-year contract with Al-Nassr where he will earn a staggering estimated $200 million a year, according to Saudi state-owned media, currently making him the world’s highest paid soccer player. As of today, 21 of the most expensive soccer players in Saudi Arabia by transfer fees – all international stars – play for one of the PIF-owned clubs. Despite the financial outlay, the SPL is remaining deliberately tight-lipped about the specifics of its financial gamble, with chief operating officer Carlo Nohra confirming to CNN Sport that it was “not in [the SPL’s] competitive advantage” to report the salaries offered to players and coaches. The PIF has $777 billion in assets under management, according to its most recent filing, with ambitions to top $1 trillion within a few years. In 2021, it acquired English soccer club Newcastle United, before focusing on investments at home. The club is now also among top spenders on players. Saudi clubs not owned by the PIF are also splurging on big-ticket players, with former Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, 33, offered an eye-watering salary of $870,000 (£700,000) per week, according to multiple reports, in an estimated $15 million (£12 million) transfer from Liverpool to Saudi team Al-Ettifaq. In a recent interview with The Athletic, Henderson said those numbers “just aren’t true.” “Essentially, the signal is ‘We mean business,’” Simon Chadwick, a professor of sport and geopolitical economy at SKEMA Business School, told CNN. “We’ve got so much money that for a player who is … coming towards the end of his career, we can afford to pay him 700,000 [GB pounds a week], or whatever it is that he’s being paid, and still have Cristiano Ronaldo and still be in the market for other players as well,” Chadwick said, describing Saudi’s approach to becoming a sporting superpower, adding that the sky is the limit in terms of cost. Saudi Arabia follows in the footsteps of several other countries – including China and Qatar in investing large sums of money to try and turn themselves into soccer powerhouses. It remains to be seen whether Saudi’s turbocharged investment will have a lasting impact or resemble something like a costly rebranding effort. The Saudi national team has been to multiple World Cups, and the country’s clubs have won multiple Asian titles. Saudi’s victory over Argentina during last year’s men’s World Cup was hailed as one of the greatest upsets in tournament history, with the country’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud granting a national public holiday in recognition of the win. Club games can attract huge crowds in the Middle Eastern nation. “For example, Al-Ittihad against Al-Hilal, you’re talking about drawing crowds of 40, 50, 60,000 people, these are games that are comparable in size to Chelsea vs. Arsenal, Manchester United vs. Manchester City,” Chadwick said. Buying star players, some arguably past their prime, also provides an easy win for Saudi teams, according to Kieran Maguire, co-host of “The Price of Football” podcast. “From the Saudi authorities’ point of view, they’re getting a ready-made product. Everybody’s heard of Benzema. Everybody’s heard of Cristiano Ronaldo and so on,” Maguire said. Saudi Arabia’s lofty sporting ambitions don’t end with the SPL or Newcastle United. The country is hosting the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup and is bidding to host the 2027 AFC Asian Cup. Several media reports also indicated that the Gulf kingdom was considering launching a bid for the 2030 FIFA men’s World Cup alongside Greece and Egypt – although it is reportedly mulling pulling its candidacy. Meanwhile, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has agreed to a contract that will see the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia until 2029, a deal that will earn the Spanish governing body between €35-45 million ($38-48 million) a year. Saudi Arabia has a very young population: the country’s most recent census revealed 32.2 million people live in the country, nearly 42% of whom are foreign nationals – and 51% of the Saudi population are under the age of 30. Of this populace, Saudi authorities say that over 80% play, attend or follow soccer, the national sport. Chadwick explains that Saudi Arabia’s government is concerned with the prospect of its younger members of society becoming radicalized or an anti-government sentiment bubbling up like that of the Arab Spring – and looks to offer its population a thriving soccer industry to keep it placated. Though the soccer industry generates employment, revenues, export earnings and inward investment, “what is just as significant is the security of the royal family,” Chadwick adds. The Arab Spring, a wave of pro-democracy protests that washed over the Middle East and North Africa in 2011, achieved mixed results. Four Arab dictators in Libya, Yemen, Egypt and Tunisia were toppled, offering a brief sense of victory for protesters, but, since then, new wars have prompted a retreat of popular movements in the region. Meanwhile, failed uprisings in Bahrain and eastern Saudi Arabia were followed by years-long crackdowns and a continuing civil war in Syria. “What we’re beginning to see in Saudi Arabia right now is the emergence of a new social contract. And the social contract essentially is catering for the needs of the Gen Z population,” Chadwick said. “You want Ronaldo? You got him. You want some of the best football teams in the world? You got them. You want the World Cup to come to Saudi Arabia? You got it … But don’t question us,” Chadwick explained. Maguire agrees, noting that investing in soccer “can be seen as part of a much broader socio-economic plan, run by the Saudi authorities.” At the same time, there has been “a significant increase in the number of Saudi Arabians detained by the authorities, for example, for posting adverse comments on social media about the country” this year, Chadwick told CNN. Human rights group Amnesty International told CNN that it has documented a rollback in human rights in Saudi Arabia, including an escalating crackdown on freedom of expression and an increased use of counterterrorism and cybercrime laws to silence dissent. Between 2022 and 2023, the organization said it has documented an increase in criminal prosecutions compared to previous years. In 2022, Amnesty reported the highest number of annual executions in the country in 30 years, with 196 people killed. “Reputation is important in terms of attracting foreign investment, and … Mohammed bin Salman, as much as he has significant financial muscle, needs foreign investing for the realization of his diversification,” James Dorsey, the author of the syndicated column and blog, “The Turbulent World of Middle East Soccer,” explains. Saudi Arabia is the world’s biggest exporter of crude oil, and nearly two-thirds of its income still comes from selling fossil fuels. But with oil prices regularly dipping below what the Gulf state needs to balance its budget, it has focused efforts on trying to bring in investment from abroad along with its efforts to raise oil prices. Projections indicate the kingdom has around 20 years to diversify its economy to ensure it is more resilient, according to Chadwick – not least to fund its Vision 2030 projects, including the $500 billion , a 106 mile-long called The Line and a futuristic plan to revamp the capital. “Part of the grand vision of Mohammed bin Salman, looking forward to 2030, he does have his desire to make Saudi Arabia less dependent on natural resources to look at a post-fuel economy [involving] tourism, entertainment. If Saudi Arabia can become a hub for major sporting events, then that’s a way of attracting interest to the country,” said Maguire. CNN has reached out to the Saudi Ministry of Sport for comment on allegations that the kingdom has been rolling back human rights, and investing in soccer as a way of “sportswashing” its image. In response to previous criticism about Saudi Arabia’s purported “sportswashing,” the kingdom’s sports minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal said: “People that don’t know Saudi Arabia, have never been to Saudi Arabia, go out and talk about it as if they’ve lived there for 30 years, 40 years. So I always tell people, come to Saudi. Come and see Saudi. “See what it is, see the people, meet the people. Look at what the country is doing for the future of the people in Saudi, then you can criticize as much as you like,” he added. Saudi Arabia has already disrupted the golf industry and, with soccer, Maguire told CNN, “they feel that they can do that probably on a smaller scale, but perhaps, ultimately, to generate more interest in terms of eyeballs if they go down the same route.” In 2021, the Saudi government-controlled PIF bankrolled , reportedly at a cost of $2 billion, attracting many of the sport’s top players away from the US-based PGA Tour and Europe-based DP World Tour by offering big dollar prize money, with PGA Tour board member Jimmy Dunne raising fears that they might end up “owning golf.” Earlier this year, the US-based announced it was set to partner with the Saudi-backed breakaway , ending a feud that has dogged the men’s professional game for the past year, with Dunne warning that sport’s governing body had no choice but to reach the truce to retain some measure of control. “They have an unlimited horizon and an unlimited amount of money,” he said at a contentious Senate hearing on the truce between the two tours. When it comes to soccer, Aleksander Ceferin, president of European football’s governing body UEFA, has dismissed the competitive threat that the SPL could pose. “As far as I know, Mbappe and [Erling] Haaland don’t dream of Saudi Arabia. I don’t believe that the best players at the pinnacle of their careers would go to Saudi Arabia,” he said last month. “When people talk to me about the players who went there, nobody knows where they’re playing.” Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp took a different view, referring to the fact that the Saudi summer transfer window stays open after European clubs see theirs close: “I don’t know how stable it is and I think the next two weeks will show how much of a challenge it is because whatever happens there, no one can react anymore. “I don’t know where it will lead to but it feels rather like a threat or a concern than not because I can’t see how we really deny it in these moments, what can we do?” he added. Still, the new SPL director of football, Michael Emenalo, says what Saudi soccer is doing is “no different from what the Premier League have done.” “There was a time when it was all about Italy. There was a time when it was all about Spain. What we’re looking for in the industry is an opportunity to compete, and to compete on an even scale and to improve upon whatever exists in the industry,” said Emenalo in a press release sent to CNN. New Saudi Pro League Chief Operating Officer Carlo Nohra told CNN that there is logic behind the league’s strategy of money is no object to lure international stars. “We can’t expect to be paying market value to entice people to come here at this early stage in our development.” But analysts say that the difference lies in the level of transparency, which “simply doesn’t exist in Saudi Arabia,” Chadwick explained to CNN. European soccer governing body UEFA has financial fair play (FFP) rules on teams’ spending, while Major League Soccer in the US has a salary cap for its clubs. Nohra told CNN that, eventually, the country wants 0.3% of its GDP to be from soccer to make it similar to that of the Premier League on the UK economy – up from its current value of “0.000 something.” “They’ve got no chance to get into that figure at present,” Maguire explained, but added that the SPL could perhaps move into the top 10 of the world’s domestic leagues. “That is feasible given the amount of money that they’re spending.” “I think they’re realistic. They don’t say that they’re going to overtake La Liga or the Premier League or the major European leagues,” Maguire said. When the compared the world’s sovereign wealth funds on criteria including governance, transparency and accountability in 2019, the PIF scored well below average on a measure combining these criteria, and ranked in the bottom 10 out of 64 funds, just above Russian Direct Investment Fund. CNN has reached out to the PIF for further comment about its investments in sport, particularly soccer and golf, and criticisms about its lack of transparency. Chadwick raised concerns over how a lack of financial rules affecting Saudi clubs might dilute UEFA’s FFP regulations, as well as those of the Premier League, or impact world soccer governing body FIFA’s systems of governance. The lack of transparency in Saudi Arabia’s wealth fund has already raised suspicions in the US golfing and political spheres. Earlier this summer, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations launched an inquiry about the PGA Tour’s agreement with the PIF-controlled LIV Golf. Chadwick told CNN that, so long as there is no independent organization that monitors the reporting of every league’s financial endeavors, “nobody really knows for sure what the accurate financial information is.” “This vacuum [of information], this uncertainty is wrapped in a veneer of lobbying, which is intended to either overinflate or underinflate player transfer values and salary information because it serves a political purpose,” Chadwick says, adding that this purpose is “signaling.” “It is almost as though football players are becoming kind of geopolitical pawns in some ways.” CNN’s Chris Isidore, Eoin McSweeney, Eleni Giokos, Andrew McNicol, Tamara Qiblawi and Andrew Raine contributed reporting.",

    "content": "Kelly Catlin and Ellie Soutter never met, but they had a lot in common. Both were commanding athletes: Catlin, a US track cyclist, was a three-times world champion and Olympic silver medalist, and Soutter, a snowboarder, was tipped to be one of Team Great Britain’s strongest contenders for the , having already won a bronze medal at the 2017 European Youth Olympic Festival. Both were incredibly smart – Catlin was studying for a master’s degree in computational and mathematical engineering at Stanford University, while Soutter learned to speak French in about six months, according to her father. At times they almost seemed superhuman. In 2013, after only three weeks of formal training and having broken her wrist, Soutter became British Champion with her arm in a cast. Meanwhile, Catlin, who had a tenderness for children, once rode 80 miles through sleet and snow to speak to a grade school about her Olympic experience. Yet these two women’s lives were tragically cut short after they sustained serious head injuries in their pursuit of sporting greatness and then took their own lives. Catlin was 23, while Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday. Females may be more susceptible to concussion, and they also have worse and prolonged symptoms after their injury than men, according to a of 25 studies of sport-related concussion published in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine. However, women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research. This, leading experts warn, means they often do not get the treatment or aftercare they need following a head injury. Women’s sports have historically not received the same attention or funding as men’s sports, Dr. Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. “It’s been shown that women athletes are more likely to get a concussion, they tend to have longer recovery periods,” McKee added. “We do not have enough information about what happens in the female brain. We don’t know if women are biologically more susceptible to these injuries,” she said, adding that some research suggests the size and musculature of women’s necks could play a part. Before becoming a track cyclist, Catlin, a triplet, was a national champion road cyclist and time trial national champion, her father Mark, told CNN. After winning a Canadian international race at 17 she was invited to an Olympic training camp for a try out, where, impressed by her performance numbers, coaches immediately offered her a position on the track pursuit team. Catlin’s father, Mark, told CNN, that his daughter was “intense” and “ambitious,” attributes she channeled into her sporting life. Her life changed irrevocably in January 2019. Practicing fast downhill descents in the hills near Los Angeles, she crashed and went skidding down the road.  Despite suffering road rash, Catlin got back on her bike, and finished the ride. It wasn’t her first crash – she had experienced 4 or 5 hard crashes before this, her father said, and after the latest, she didn’t have any symptoms at the time. But soon after, at a World Cup track event in Berlin, Catlin was gripped by a sudden and severe headache. “She couldn’t compete,” her father said. “Kelly is kind of this stoical individual. And if she’s rolling around on the ground, clutching her head, it has to be a severe thing.” On closer inspection, Catlin’s helmet from LA had dents in it. Her father told CNN that this, coupled with her symptoms, caused her family to become aware she had suffered a concussion, which was later confirmed with a diagnosis from Stanford’s Health Centre. A concussion is a brain injury which happens after a hit to the head or body causes the brain to move back and forth inside the skull, according to the CDC. When Catlin returned to the US, her father says she was examined by the track training center in Colorado. It was confirmed she suffered a concussion, and a return to training protocol was advised, but not implemented or communicated to her coach, he said. “There wasn’t any follow-up from Colorado after this. I believe they assumed she would seek care at Stanford,” he told CNN. CNN has reached out to Stanford and USA Cycling for comment. Catlin’s symptoms didn’t improve, and in weekly phone calls with her parents, she admitted she was struggling with schoolwork and was unable to concentrate. Stanford Health Center, having diagnosed Catlin with concussion with ongoing symptoms, recommended that she decrease her training for 2 weeks and then gradually build back up and start sessions with an athletic trainer, medical documents sent to CNN by her father show. She was referred to a concussion specialist, the document adds. She tried to train, but “she would have to stop because she got a severe headache just from walking,” according to her father. Her heart rate would also accelerate rapidly from even the smallest exertion, leaving her with “no exercise tolerance whatsoever,” he added. Wherever she turned she could not find help.” Mark Catlin Her injury had other consequences. “As far as we knew she was never a person that suffered from depression. She had an interesting sense of humor.  She was always upbeat and bubbly about things,” her father told CNN. “She basically thought her life was over. She was no longer able to be the athlete that she was, she was failing her teammates. And she wasn’t able to succeed in school now. And I think ultimately, that’s why she took her life, because she thought her life was over,” he added. At the end of January, Catlin made a serious but non-fatal suicide attempt, and was involuntarily admitted to the locked psychiatric ward at Stanford, her father told CNN. A month after that attempt, she took her own life. Soutter’s father Tony said there were many dimensions to his young daughter – not only was she an “adrenaline junkie,” but she was “very conscientious” and excelled in school, even after moving from England to France. Aged 12, Soutter took up snowboarding at school – and just months later, she was spotted in her hometown resort of Les Gets and trialed by Team Great Britain in February 2013. “It was quite obvious why she kept winning competitions because she just made it easy,” her father said. “She just made it look graceful and beautiful.” But training took its toll – Soutter told CNN that his daughter suffered seven major concussions in five years, between 2013 and 2018. “I was being advised by doctors “Oh, don’t worry, she’s young enough she’ll bounce back. As she progressed, becoming an elite athlete starting on the World Cup circuit, every time she had another concussion, they got worse, and they took longer to recover from,” he told CNN. “With every concussion, with the exception of a few minor knocks, Ellie saw a doctor in person,” he added. “I was always told that she was young enough to bounce back to full health after each case and therefore never consulted with the doctors that I met, about any previous concussions.” But Soutter’s final concussion was so “huge” that she spent two nights in the hospital. “When I got there, she didn’t even know who I was or where she was,” her father said. Soutter was then selected for the Junior Snowboard World Championships in New Zealand August 2018.  But a month before the competition, she died by suicide. I truly believe today that my daughter would be alive had I had…even the smallest bit of information.” Tony Soutter Her father said a neurologist conducted a CT scan of her brain and reaction tests three months after her final concussion, but said she was “absolutely fine” and could continue competing. Like Catlin, Soutter had issues with studying and concentrating, becoming more insular as she suffered from crippling headaches. She also started suffering from insomnia. “She would literally sit with the tutor a good month after a concussion, and suddenly, she’d go blind. She’d not be able to see – everything would go black and dark,” her father said. After missing a flight to snowboard training, Soutter died by suicide on her 18th birthday. Team GB referred CNN to GB Snowsport when approached for comment, adding that Ellie only competed for Team GB at one event. In order to represent Britain in international competitions, GB Snowsport says athletes or their coaches are required to demonstrate that the athlete has reached established performance criteria, is of the relevant technical ability to compete, and has appropriate medical clearance to compete. A large number of athletes can represent Britain at different levels of international competition but are not part of a programme delivered and overseen by GB Snowsport. “As Ellie was not part of the GB Snowsport programme, we were unable to implement a personalised recovery and management programme for Ellie,” a spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN in an email. “She was, however, covered by national policies and protocols around fitness to compete, and would not have been cleared for any activity – training or competition – overseen by GB Snowsport without being able to demonstrate appropriate medical sign-off,” they added. The spokesperson for GB Snowsport told CNN: “We take concussions and head injuries incredibly seriously, and in reviewing contemporaneous records from the time that Ellie was involved in snowsport we are confident that GB Snowsport staff applied and followed every appropriate process.” Catlin and Soutter aren’t the only young sporting women whose lives have been cut short in this way. After 29-year-old Australian rules football player took her life in 2020, post-mortem research by scientists found that she had degradation to her cerebral white matter unusual for someone her age. “For someone her age, you would expect to see lovely pristine white matter, and hers looked like she was an old woman in that it was basically degraded,” Michael Buckland, founder and Executive Director of the Australian Sports Brain Bank, who studied Barclay’s brain, told CNN. “We haven’t gone back and done specific white matter studies on our donors,” he told CNN, adding that the bank hasn’t done peer reviewed research on this.  “But what struck me, just as someone that sees a lot of brains – this is not normal for someone of that age.” Damage to white matter has been associated with dementia, according to in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Suicide after concussion is rare. However patients diagnosed with concussion or mild traumatic brain injury had double the risk of suicide and a higher risk of suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts than people without brain injuries, a 2018 from researchers at the University of Harvard published in JAMA Neurology found. Dr. Robert Cantu, clinical professor of neurology at the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at Boston University School of Medicine told CNN that there are several theories as to why incidence of suicide is higher in people who have suffered concussion. One theory, he explained, is that those suffering from persistent post-concussion symptoms may have structural or functional brain damage and could be experiencing “behavioral dysregulation: short fuse, irritability, [and] can’t suppress impulses the way you normally could.” With these emotional problems, “they would be more prone to perhaps do something impulsive, like commit suicide,” Cantu, medical director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, told CNN. A second theory, Cantu noted, is that post-concussive symptoms prevent people from getting back into their sport and stop them “from being the person that they were before their injury.” Neither theory is proven to the exclusion of the other, Cantu said, adding he thinks increased suicidality was “a combined factor involving both in many, if not most cases.” There are also differences in the way brain injuries affect women. A study of female soccer players across US high schools found they are nearly twice as likely to suffer concussion as their male counterparts, according to research that looked at over 80,000 adolescent athletes, published in the journal . Women remain significantly underrepresented within sport and exercise science research: examining papers from some of the most influential sports medical journals found that only 6% of the studies were solely focused on women, compared with 31% of studies that included just men. Other researchers have pointed to female sex hormones, with risk of concussion changing with hormone levels during a menstrual cycle. McKee said all athletes can also experience “non-concussive” injuries: “hits to the head that can be of the same magnitude as concussion, but they don’t rise to the level of symptoms for whatever reason, so a player tends to play right through it.” Cumulative exposure to repetitive head impacts – including concussion and non- concussive injuries – increases the risk for the neurodegenerative brain disease , known as CTE, McKee said. The disease, which can only be formally diagnosed with an autopsy, has mostly been seen in either veterans or people who played contact sports, , say researchers. The disease occurs when the brain starts to degenerate likely due to repeated head traumas, according to the Mayo Clinic, which notes CTE is “associated with recurrent concussions.” But scientists aren’t only concerned about concussions. Previous studies have shown subconcussive head impacts – repetitive hits to the head and body that do not cause symptoms – can still result in long-term neurological disease. According to The Concussion Legacy Foundation, “the best available evidence suggests that subconcussive impacts, not concussions, are the driving force behind CTE.” There have been cases of CTE discovered in athletes who have never been diagnosed with a concussion, according to the Concussion Legacy Foundation. And other changes in the brain after repetitive head impacts aside from CTE are likely “equally important,” McKee said. “We also see damage to the white matter. And that appears to be mostly in the frontal lobe, but also in the temporal lobes,” she said. “We’re trying to understand the relationship of those white matter changes to behavioral and mood symptoms, perhaps even suicidality,” she said. McKee stressed that concussion management is important, but physicians and athletes should also be aware of other injuries. “The problem is the subclinical hits – the non-concussive injuries that aren’t detected, you don’t pull the player off the field – and they can be in the hundreds or even the 1000s in a single season,” she explained. Though a growing body of data suggests women in sport are more likely to sustain a concussion, have more severe symptoms, and to take longer to recover, most sports-related concussions protocols are based on data from men. In a in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers looked at 171 concussion studies written since 1967 which are used to inform the most influential consensus and position statements in treating sports-related concussions. Clinicians rely on these documents to guide their medical practice when treating athletes – but most of the studies are focused on men. Only 1% of them was looking exclusively at concussions in women and 40% of them didn’t have any women in a sample of participants at all. There is another risk factor for women in sport when they sustain head injuries, Katherine Snedaker, founder and executive director of PINK Concussions, a non-profit dedicated to women’s health and brain injury, told CNN. There is a gulf of millions of dollars separating women and men when it comes to average annual salaries in most professional sports. Outside of elite sport, Snedaker says, female athletes often don’t have access to the same medical care as men, meaning head injuries aren’t spotted as routinely. “They tend to push really hard through the injury,” she said. And many women can’t afford to take time out to recover: even professional athletes will supplement their sports income with other jobs, she added, and many are caregivers. “When they really crater, it’s a couple of days or weeks later.” Snedaker said female athletes often weren’t aware they had suffered a head injury. If they were, she said, there were no appropriate medical or sporting staff to inform. The families of Catlin and Soutter feel the young women didn’t get enough support after their injuries. After Catlin’s first suicide attempt, she was released from an involuntary admission to the psychiatric ward after threatening legal action, and a conference between psychiatrists, her coach and her parents. She attended therapy sessions, which she agreed to attend during the conference, but found “they were geared toward suicidal freshman with a whole set of different issues than an elite Olympic athlete,” her father told CNN. She got a referral to a sports psychologist that worked with the Stanford athletic department, but the department forbade the psychologist from seeing Catlin because she was not a varsity athlete, her father added. She contacted the office of a sports psychologist with whom she had developed a rapport while in the hospital – but, his appointment secretary said he had no openings for six months, her father told CNN. “Wherever she turned she could not find help,” he said, adding that his daughter tried a suicide hotline several times: she was once put on hold and once received no answer. Catlin described his daughter as a “stoic, female warrior type person that isn’t going to admit that she’s struggling.” “She needed a sports psychiatrist that really could understand what she was going through and understand the rigors of her life in terms of preparation for competitions and the athletic side of it and what it could potentially do to you.” Her father said a major factor in his daughter’s death was “a lack of communication between the facilities that were involved in Kelly’s care. No one was in charge and they assumed the other institutions were following up when they weren’t,” he added. In a statement sent to CNN, Luisa Rapport, director of emergency communications and media relations at Stanford University did not address any of the specific allegations made by Catlin’s family.  She said while the university does not discuss in the media the details of individual students’ experiences, “supporting the mental and emotional health of students is a critical priority for Stanford.” “Students in need of mental health crisis assistance – including students having suicidal thoughts – and those who are concerned about students in need of assistance, can contact the University’s Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) 24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week,” she added. Rapport said that in addition to this, “there are multiple places where psychological services may be provided for students depending on individualized need and treatment recommendations, including, for example, affiliated hospital services and clinics through Stanford’s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and mental health programs and clinicians in the community.” In a statement sent to CNN, USA Cycling said it was “devastated” by Catlin’s death, adding: “She brought focus and determination to everything she did, and served as an inspiration to everyone who knew her. “As the National Governing Body for the sport of cycling, USA Cycling prioritizes the holistic wellbeing of the riders on the U.S. National Team and has a longstanding commitment to providing both physical and mental health resources to members of the team,” a representative for USA Cycling added. After his daughter Ellie’s death, Soutter was contacted by the UNITE Brain Bank, who wanted to study her brain as part of their research into CTE. But even in that facility – the biggest of its kind in the world – of some 1,300 brains, only 3% belonged to women, Ann McKee, Director of the Boston University Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center told CNN. “When I actually started looking into CTE – all of the work that they’ve done with the footballers in America, she had every single symptom and more,” Soutter told CNN. “It was quite obvious to me that there was a definite link in her starting to get into dark places and feeling bad and anxious and not sleeping properly. All of those symptoms … Every one that’s involved in CTE was part of Ellie’s life,” he added. “I truly believe today that my daughter would be alive had I had any inkling, you know, even the smallest bit of information.” Correction: CNN’s Krystina Shveda contributed reporting.",

    "content": "The are fast approaching and as athletes gear up for one of the world’s most prestigious sporting events, one entrepreneur has a different idea of what “faster, higher, stronger” – the former motto of the Games – might represent. The says it is an “alternative” to what it calls the “corrupt Olympics Games.” Athletes competing at the Enhanced Games will be free to use performance-enhancing drugs, they won’t be tested and will be under no obligation to declare which substances they have taken in order to compete. That’s quite a contrast to the Olympics’ doping protocols. The International Testing Agency (ITA) will be responsible for looking after Paris 2024’s anti-doping program. Six years ago, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which oversees the Olympics, delegated its entire clean sport program to the ITA. However, historically the Olympic Games have been dogged by a series of doping and kickback scandals. When approached for comment on the Enhanced Games and allegations of corruption, the IOC told that “the idea does not merit any comment.” CNN Sport interviewed a number of experts in the field of doping for this story, who expressed concern that the Enhanced Games was an extremely dangerous proposition. , who exposed Russia’s state-sponsored doping program – a massive, years-long effort which benefited more than 1,000 athletes between 2011 and 2015 – said that the Enhanced Games is a “danger to health, to sport.” Whether the Enhanced Games will ever take place remains an open question, but the very idea is drawing considerable blowback from leading anti-doping officials and sporting organizations. The Enhanced Games is the brainchild of businessman Aron D’Souza. He is also the founding editor of “ ,” a quarterly publication on legal philosophy, according to his website, which also describes him as an “avid athlete.” Recently, D’Souza told CNN Sport he has “signed term sheets with prominent venture capital firms” in relation to the Enhanced Games and is “waiting on the lawyers to finish long-form drafting.” He also said that a funding announcement is planned for early December. Although not legally binding, term sheets are a serious expression of intent by both sides, setting out the broad principles of an agreement. D’Souza believes what he calls a “science-driven” competition is the next step in the evolution of sport, suggesting that the absence of drug testing will level the playing field. According to a 2020 study from Raphael Faiss, Research Manager at the centre of Research and Expertise in anti-doping sciences at the University of Lausanne, data from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) suggests less than 2% of athletes dope. However, Faiss told CNN Sport the number of athletes taking performance-enhancing drugs is likely significantly higher; his research, based on two international major athletic events in 2011 and 2013, suggests the figure could be between 15 to 18%. Faiss and his team compared athletes’ blood results collected by WADA-accredited labs to values from healthy adults, as well as doped and undoped athletes; the closer the values are to those of subjects to whom erythropoietin (EPO, which is used in blood doping) had been administered, the higher the chances that they’re actually doping. This analysis, Faiss said, is not proof of doping, but is a “robust way” of analyzing the data, allowing scientists to make an estimate for doping prevalence, as well as targeting athletes most likely to be doping. In written comments to CNN Sport, WADA said: “Determining the level of [doping] prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed,” explaining that, since 2017, a “prevalence working group” has been established to “determine if strategies, reliable methods and tools can be developed to adequately assess the prevalence of doping in sports.” WADA told CNN Sport that the group has delivered “several recommendations and guidance to WADA but not the final ones yet.” WADA has reservations about Faiss’ study and pointed to the “complexity of trying to measure [doping] prevalence,” highlighting that reports have “greatly varying results.” The anti-doping organization added: “No single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline.” “Comparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system’s testing figures isn’t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. “In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries – it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. “The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.” Travis Tygart, the Chief Executive Officer at the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), told CNN Sport that the idea of an Enhanced Games is “farcical … likely illegal in many [US] states” and “a dangerous clown show, not real sport.” Substances such as anabolic steroids – which help to build muscle mass by enabling athletes to train harder and recover quickly from strenuous workouts – are classified as a Schedule III drug by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. When asked whether anabolic steroids will be allowed at the games and whether athletes would be tested for illegal drugs such as cocaine, D’Souza told CNN Sport that “we will not be drug testing at the games.” He added: “We do not propose to regulate what athletes use.” Anabolic steroids may be prescribed by a licensed physician for the treatment of certain conditions such as testosterone deficiency, but if used in the US without a prescription from a licensed physician, a first conviction could result in a one-year prison sentence and a $1,000 fine. But that isn’t the only potential legal jeopardy the Enhanced Games faces, according to American lawyer Jim Walden, who represents Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov. “If you look at the Enhanced Games website, it’s almost as though they’re advertising their disregard of the law,” Walden told CNN Sport. “They wrap themselves up in what I will call the cloak of legitimacy by using phrases like body autonomy and coming out as an enhanced athlete. “I hope they’re thinking hard about how they’re going to pull this off in the world in which the FBI has a specific unit that is called the Sports and Gaming Initiative that’s focusing on these very issues.” The Sports and Gaming Initiative was developed to “protect athletes and sporting institutions in the United States from criminal threats and influences,” according to the government website. The initiative works in partnership with sports leagues and governing bodies, international law enforcement and independent watchdog groups to tackle crimes such as fraud, doping and match-fixing; criminal activities, it says, “degrade the integrity of sports and competition and erode public confidence in these cherished institutions.” “The use of doping substances is not acceptable in modern sports,” Rodchenkov said in his written comments to CNN. “Promotion and advertising of banned substances is against sport rules and moral, letter and spirit. “It might bring an extreme harm to young generation[s] of athletes who mistakenly could believe in benefits of [the] Enhanced Games.” Rodchenkov, the protagonist of the Oscar-winning Netflix documentary who is currently under FBI protection, also believes that the Enhanced Games’ organizers “might get investigated […] under the Rodchenkov Act.” The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, named after the whistleblower, allows the US to impose criminal sanctions on individuals involved in doping activities at international events. However, the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act does not apply to sporting events that don’t adopt the WADA code, which the Enhanced Games wouldn’t do. Rodchenkov also added that WADA athletes could not have any affiliation or contact with so-called enhanced athletes, or they would risk being charged under Article 2.10 – “Prohibited Association by an Athlete or Other Person” – of the World Anti-Doping Code. USADA’s Tygart also told CNN Sport: “No one really wants our children growing up idolizing unbridled drug use in sport, even if some profiteers think otherwise.” D’Souza insists his motivation for founding the Enhanced Games isn’t financial. If he had wanted to make more money, he says he’d continue to be a “quiet, mild-mannered venture capitalist.” “I do think fundamentally that consumers want this [the Enhanced Games] and athletes want this because if you go to the cinemas, no one’s interested in histories in the past anymore,” said D’Souza. “They’re interested in superheroes and technology in the future. And this is literally what we are bringing to a reality.” According to Pierre de Coubertin – the founder of the modern Olympics – “for every man, woman and child, it [sport] offers an opportunity for self-improvement.” Except historically, many athletes competing in the Olympics have taken the idea of self-improvement too far, notably at London 2012, which Rodchenkov has previously called “the dirtiest Olympics in history.” When the ITA concluded its re-analysis program for the London Games, it found 73 anti-doping rule violations, which led to the withdrawal of 31 medals and reallocation of 46 Olympic medals across the sports of athletics, weightlifting, wrestling and canoeing. Doping has been an issue at the Olympics throughout the event’s history, and the 100-meter final at the 1988 Games has become one of the most infamous and controversial moments in sporting history. Six of the eight finalists – notably the winner, Ben Johnson – who lined up on that September day in Seoul 35 years ago would fail drug tests themselves or be implicated in drug use during their careers. Despite some athletes continuing to cheat, global antidoping efforts remain ever-present, according to the testers. Recent out-of-competition (OOC) testing data published by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) highlights positive results from steps being taken to keep “elite podiums and finals clean,” according to the anti-doping organization. Data focused on OOC testing ahead of last year’s World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, shows how resources and testing are targeting those athletes most likely to win medals and make finals. Whilst only 39% of the athletes in Eugene had three or more OOC tests in the 10 months leading up the event, 81% of top-eight finishers had three or more OOC tests. Yet the cat and mouse game between testers and athletes using banned substances continues. “It’s mostly about the question of timing and targeting the right athletes,” said Faiss. Given that athletes have their blood values regularly monitored, it is “getting more difficult for athletes to use high doses [of drugs such as EPO], but they would still be using micro dosing.” By taking EPO late at night and drinking enough water, the substance would not be detected in athletes the following morning, according to Faiss, though athletes suspected of blood doping could be tested in the middle of the night. “Athletes are actually getting back to very simple ways of doping with steroids,” he said, adding that “EPO is quite simple to use, but still tricky to detect.” Athletes “use the drugs that are actively working.” When it comes to new substances such as Roxadustat – the drug that two-time grand slam champion has recently been given a four-year ban for taking, although she denies ever knowingly or intentionally taking any prohibited substance – Faiss said athletes “are likely to use substances with a very short half-life in [the] body that are mimicking processes of the oxygen carrying improvements through the EPO channels.” Roxadustat has an elimination half-life of 10-16 hours, according to the National Institutes of Health. Athletes are “seeking to find substances where the [half-life] time window is very short, to make sure that if they are not tested at the right moment, they won’t be caught,” said Faiss. Michele Verroken, the founding director of consultancy group Sporting Integrity, believes an antidoping system is required that will “give a lot more credibility, a lot more immediacy to verifying results, if we’re going to keep the hearts and minds of athletes.” Verroken also questions what’s stopping an athlete from cheating if they only get caught 10 years after the event, or not at all. Under the World Anti-Doping Code, there is a 10-year statute of limitations on samples taken from 2015 onwards. Verroken told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games is “setting a really interesting challenge for sporting competition.” Not unsurprisingly, many sporting bodies have condemned the event. The Australian Olympic Committee called it “dangerous and irresponsible,” saying that “the world needs better than this.” UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) said it “is extremely concerned by the concept of an Enhanced Games,” adding that “there is no place in sport for performance enhancing drugs, nor the Enhanced Games.” UKAD’s Director of Operations, Hamish Coffey, told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games sets a “hugely dangerous precedent,” expressing concern over the kind of messaging the event sends to the next generation of athletes. When CNN Sport spoke to D’Souza shortly after the proposed event’s announcement, he said that 368 athletes had enquired about the Enhanced Games and more had messaged via social media. The organization’s Chief Athletes Officer and former Olympian Brett Fraser, who swam for the Cayman Islands at three Olympic Games, told CNN Sport that “very accomplished athletes” at the level of Olympic finalists have reached out “to understand more about how the first Games will take place and how they can become involved.” Fraser added that Enhanced Games organizers “already have an Olympic medallist” for their athlete commission, though he didn’t specify who that was. He also said there has been “a lot of positive feedback and a lot of acceptance and excitement from younger generations.” Nonetheless, none of the athletes appear prepared to speak publicly at this stage. For those who do want to compete, the Enhanced Games would be an annual event with five categories – track and field, swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics and martial arts. The huge cost of hosting an Olympic Games is no secret, with countries often striving to create bigger and better spectacles by blowing their budget. Tokyo 2021 had the largest Olympic sports program in history, with 33 sports competitions in 42 venues culminating in 339 medal events. The Covid-impacted Games were delivered with a final expenditure of $13 billion – almost double the $7.3 billion that was originally forecast. Meanwhile, keeping the IOC’s philosophy of “lower-impact Games” in mind, 95% of venues will be pre-existing facilities at the Paris 2024 Olympics. D’Souza said the Enhanced Games will focus on fewer sports, reuse existing infrastructure and fund the event through the private sector to “deliver a high-impact yet cost-efficient games” so profits can be shared with the athletes. He added that the Enhanced Games is looking for a seven-figure prize pool for any athlete potentially breaking Usain Bolt’s 100-meter world record of 9.58 seconds. “I’ve had conversations with people who are top-10 sprinters in the world who are going to the next Olympics, and they said […] if there’s a million-dollar prize to break the 100m world record, I’ll be there,” said D’Souza. Universal basic income and mental health support to athletes will also be part of an “enhanced athletes programme.” When asked who would take responsibility if an athlete competing at the Enhanced Games were to suffer fatal consequences, D’Souza told CNN Sport that “our athletes at the games will be the most monitored athletes in history.” He said: “We will focus on athlete safety by mandating athletes have pre-competition full-system clinical screenings including blood tests and EKGs.” “This will ensure that athletes are healthy to complete and not at risk of major health complications.” D’Souza also said that athletes will sign waivers in order to compete. As it stands, no venues are officially in place to host the event and D’Souza admits its scale will be dependent on funding and media partnerships. “We’re in commercial negotiations with venues and media partners at the moment,” added D’Souza, who said the first Enhanced Games will be at a university campus or a similar facility in the south of the US and that a number of trademarks have been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Elite performance coach Trevor Painter, who has worked with a number of Olympic and international sprinters and middle-distance runners, said he would “never” coach an athlete taking performance-enhancing drugs because it would go against his morals as a coach. “Having been involved with many athletes that have lost in many ways to the cheats, I won’t be engaging with [the Enhanced Games],” Painter told CNN Sport. If it goes ahead as planned in December 2024, D’Souza insists that the Enhanced Games will unlock the potential of humanity. But according to John William Devine, Senior Lecturer in Ethics, Sport and Exercise Sciences at Swansea University in Wales, the Enhanced Games will make sporting competition more unfair than it already is and even “undermine the very purpose of the sport in question.” Devine told CNN Sport that “performance-enhancing drugs don’t actually lead to better athletic performance. They obscure athletic performance.” He added that, although the Enhanced Games may look very similar to the Olympics, the nature of the activity will be different, raising the question: “To what extent is drug-assisted performance reflective of the athletes’ sporting excellence?”",

    "content": "Daniel Carcillo wanted two things in life: to play hockey and to be a father. The Canadian started ice skating aged three and got his start in professional ice hockey as soon as he graduated high school. By 20 he’d broken into the NHL and over the next decade would play for the Philadelphia Flyers, New York Rangers and Los Angeles Kings. By 30, he was a two-time Stanley Cup winner with the Chicago Blackhawks and, in 2015, had retired from the sport, poised to enjoy retirement with his wife and three children, he says. By age 31, he was suicidal. After seven diagnosed concussions, Carcillo tells CNN that he was suffering from “dementia-like” symptoms, along with depression, anxiety and headaches, so much so that even a day out with his kids felt torturous. “If they want to go outside on a very sunny day, and I can’t find my dark glasses to block the sun out … I would try to go outside and tough it … that would trigger a headache, and that would trigger head pressure,” Carcillo tells CNN Sport. “Your impulse control is off,” he explained. “It would be miserable … Eventually, I would just go inside.” Carcillo says he also suffered from insomnia and disrupted sleep and would go to bed at 4 or 5 a.m., trying to sleep as much as he could during the day so that he wasn’t around anybody or in the sun. “It’s a very lonely place to be,” he says. He spent over $500,000 on prescription medications and treatments at stroke rehabilitation centers, brain centers, and concussion centers, as well as holistic therapies, and worried that he was a “burden in people’s lives.” Then in a “last-ditch effort” to try and alleviate his symptoms, he says he took a – the main psychoactive ingredient in magic mushrooms – in Denver, which became “And I woke up the next day and I describe it as feeling the way I should,” said Carcillo. “I felt like, for the first time in a very, very long time, I had a zest for life. All I wanted to do was get on FaceTime and call my wife and call my kids and get back home.” Carcillo isn’t the only athlete – former or current – openly talking about using psychedelics to treat various conditions. Psychedelics, described by Harvard Health as a “loosely grouped class of drugs that are able to induce altered thoughts and sensory perceptions” - including acid (LSD), mushrooms (psilocybin), ecstasy (MDMA), ayahuasca, DMT (dimethyltryptamine) and ketamine - have a checkered legal history. In 2022, residents in Colorado joined Oregon in voting to legalize psilocybin. have shown that , given in a therapeutic setting, can make dramatic and long-lasting changes in people suffering from treatment-resistant , though scientists are still exploring the how and the why behind the connection between psychedelics and improved mental health. Last year, , more commonly known as ecstasy, and psilocybin for certain mental health disorders. But experts also warn that taking psilocybin and other hallucinogens comes with potential health risks, such as psychosis or other longer-term mental health issues in some, as well as physical effects such as raised blood pressure and heart rate abnormalities. NFL quarterback has continued to advocate for the legalization of some psychedelics, claiming last year that ayahuasca – a drink made from Amazonian plants that contain a psychoactive ingredient – helped to improve his performance on the football field. “Is it not ironic that the things that actually expand your mind are illegal and the things that keep you in the lower chakras [energy points in the body] and dumb you down have been legal for centuries?” Rodgers said last year at Former pro boxer Mike Tyson has that magic mushrooms changed his life, and UFC President Dana White in 2021 to research on psychedelic drugs as a therapy for fighters’ brain health. Elite athletes experience mental health disorder symptoms and psychological distress at similar, if not higher, rates to the general population, researchers pointed out in a study published in the Courtney Walton, an academic fellow in psychology at Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences, told CNN that many athletes fear seeking mental health support, believing “they may be perceived as somehow less competent or resilient than their peers and competitors, which can be made worse by upcoming team or coaching selection pressures. He added that “athletes might overlook or normalize symptoms of mental ill-health, as rationalized within a highly pressurized environment.” Walton explained it is “likely that psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy has particular appeal to athletes given the more time-constrained nature of treatment.” He added that “psychedelics do not typically appear to have significant physical side effects” which could appeal to athletes who have experienced or heard of negative experiences with psychiatric medicine affecting performance. UFC Senior Vice President of Athlete Health and Performance Jeff Novitzky said in May 2021 that White gave him a “directive” to explore psychedelic research to see if it helps with addiction and mental-health problems, as well as traumatic brain injury. Novitzky told CNN the UFC is interested in any therapies that have the potential to improve brain health, and that the organization has had discussions with experts from institutions like Johns Hopkins and the University of Miami about the potential application of psychedelics, though nothing has progressed past preliminary conversations at this stage. “All the scientists that we’ve talked to said, ‘Hey, there’s a potential real benefit here to treat brain injuries and for brain health,’” said Novitzky, adding there is still negative stigma associated with some drugs, citing cannabis. Three years ago, the UFC changed its anti-doping policy so that ”positive tests over the threshold and decision limit for carboxy-THC, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, will no longer be considered a violation of the UFC Anti-Doping Policy, unless additional evidence exists that an athlete used it intentionally for performance-enhancing purposes,” according to posted on their site in 2021. Researchers in the field say that psychedelics are shown to work when treating some mental health conditions. “The case is compelling when you look at this as a psychological treatment, where you might be treating depression or more or less any other psychiatric disorder with a couple of exceptions,” Robin Carhart-Harris, Ralph Metzner Distinguished Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry at University of California San Francisco, told CNN Sport. However, when it comes to treating brain injuries with psychedelics, “the truth of the matter is that there’s a lot that’s not known,” Carhart-Harris, former head of the Centre for Psychedelic Research at Imperial College London, added. “There is an increasing amount of evidence to suggest that psychedelics promote aspects of brain growth,” he says, adding: “We need that smoking gun: a clear demonstration of this in an injured brain where we see regeneration afterwards. And at the moment, we’re close, but no cigar,” he said. Carhart-Harris warned that psychedelics are “potent” and have the power to make people “psychologically agitated” when they are already psychologically vulnerable. “People think they can just turn on, tune in and cure themselves. And it’s not that simple,” he added, explaining that if psychedelics aren’t paired with psychological support or psychotherapy they can be “harmful.” James Rucker, a consultant psychiatrist and a senior clinical lecturer at King’s College London, said that evidence has shown that psilocybin can be used to manage treatment-resistant depression but warns that psychedelics are “very hyped,” with people having “huge expectations” as to their impacts. “With great expectation comes great capacity for disappointment,” Rucker said, adding that while this can often be dealt with positively in a medical setting, “if you’re on your own, if you’re in a crappy situation, that can make things worse.” Following the head injuries sustained during his hockey career, the now 39-year-old Carcillo began struggling with depression and anxiety and was self-medicating with alcohol, painkillers, muscle relaxers and sleep aids. Suffering from slurred speech, weight loss and memory issues, he became “very disinterested in life” after the birth of his first child. “I just didn’t care, which was very weird that I felt that disconnected because I’ve always wanted to be a dad. It was kind of scary,” he said. Carcillo was one of several hundred players who accused the NHL of failing to prevent hockey-related head trauma and hiding the dangers. The lawsuit in 2018, with the league not accepting liability for the claims. In 2019, by now a father of three, Carcillo found himself in a “very, very dark, dark place. I didn’t think I had a way out.” He began reading medical papers and found a psilocybin study from the Imperial College of London, where researchers found “the psychedelic compound may effectively reset the activity of key brain circuits known to play a role in depression.” That’s when Carcillo traveled to a decriminalized city and “partook in a really large dose ceremony,” taking the psilocybin recreationally and not part of a clinical study. Later, he founded Wesana Health, a biotechnology company which focuses on developing psychedelic medicine for mental health, the most recent being a CBD and psilocybin-based drug. The company met with the US Food and Drug Administration in March 2022 and has been working through the early drug development process, and recently sold the program to NASDAQ-listed Lucy Scientific Discovery. He is no longer involved in the company. He told CNN that he regularly microdoses psilocybin, as well as partaking in larger doses from time to time. “I continue to monitor my health with regular brain scans and blood work, and adjust my dosing schedule of medicinal mushrooms accordingly,” he added. Carcillo is clear that his current well-being isn’t solely due to psilocybin, saying he exercises regularly, is careful to manage his sleep as well as sugar and alcohol intake, and makes sure to get out and about in the sunshine. Former US rugby player Anna Symonds says she was diagnosed with TBI about 10 years ago and has to take several different hormones that her body – notably her pituitary gland –  is not making as a result of the head injuries. Now retired from rugby, Symonds tells CNN Sport she has started to feel the effects of injuries to her body and head from years of participating in contact sports like rugby, soccer and mixed martial arts as well as being involved in two car crashes. “I was physically not feeling well. In addition to my pituitary issues, I have an autoimmune issue with my thyroid,” she explains, adding that she also experiences headaches, memory issues, depression and anxiety. She began using psychedelics to help with this, taking part in “macrodose-level journeys or ceremonies with mushrooms, LSD, ayahuasca and Toad.” Also known as , the amphibian releases a venom called 5-MeO-DMT, which is known to have hallucinogenic effects, according to the Addiction Center website, which also warns of its dangers. Symonds used a synthetic form of the compound, which does not harm the toads. Since her retirement as an athlete, Symonds explains that she uses psychedelic drugs for clarity, though not under the direction of a doctor. She adds that using cannabis for pain relief or using psilocybin does not necessarily elicit dramatic changes compared with other plant-based psychedelics. “It’s this groove, it’s the spiral that you can’t seem to get out of, and it just almost reinforces itself. The experience of plant medicines is for me, like psychedelics, is that it lifts you out of the groove.” Guidance from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) states that the effects of psychedelic and dissociative drugs may be difficult to predict and depend on many factors. Short-term side effects from the drugs can include headaches, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, high blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, trembling and diarrhea, the NIH notes, though it adds that reported cases of side-effects likely represent only a very small number of users. Rucker tells CNN: “I feel I need to draw a clear line between what we do in our clinical trials - which is safe and contained - and recreational use, which can be therapeutic, but can be dangerous, and is, by definition, experimental.” Rucker added that it’s important not to overhype the effects of substances like psilocybin for mental health conditions, as other treatments including antidepressants, lithium, cognitive behavior therapy, meditation and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can have similar effects. “They’re special, they’re unique, but they’re not that special,” says Rucker. “They’re just drugs. And we need to work out where they sit and not be too gung-ho with them.” Rucker says that more education is needed around psychedelics, as regardless of a country’s laws, people will continue to take these substances. “We need to make sure that people are doing their homework and not treating this as a recreational drug like any other but actually treating it with the respect it deserves,” he tells CNN. Carhart-Harris explains “all aspects of mental illness can fall on anyone, whether they be a sportsperson or not.” Still, he adds that psychedelics could be harnessed to enhance sporting performance, through enhancing discipline or helping people to process pressure or failure. “Then you have the sort of positive psychology side, where you could use, for example, low doses of psychedelics to enhance some of the training, say, getting more into one’s body, more easily entering flow states, intense focus, not being too heady and cerebral. I think there is real potential for using psychedelics in a sort of skillful way,” Carhart-Harris says. Symonds adds: “Medicines don’t just have to be a treatment for when you’re sick or ill or broken, they can be something that you take to keep you well or to enhance your wellness, your wellbeing, your spirituality.” Editor’s Note: CNN’s George Ramsay contributed reporting.",

    "content": "The crowd has had plenty of local success to celebrate over the last week-and-a-half, with and Lorenzo Musetti reaching the semifinals of the men’s draw, and reaching the final on the women’s side. An imperious Sinner, who returned from a three-month doping ban at the tournament, dropped just one game as he crushed No. 6 seed Caper Ruud 6-0 6-1 on Thursday. Perhaps there has been an element of divine intervention for Sinner this week after the world No. 1 met the new pope, Leo XIV, at the Vatican on Wednesday and gifted the pontiff a tennis racket. “I never experienced something like this,” Sinner said of the meeting. “I met important people in my young life. This was just something else. “I didn’t know exactly really what to say. It was a very emotional thing also with my parents there. It was something I will never forget, that’s for sure.” Meanwhile, Ruud took Thursday’s defeat with good humor, saying that “it was just like playing a wall that shoots 100mph balls at you all the time.” “It doesn’t feel so bad,” Ruud dded. “Honestly, I think it was more fun than anything, even though I lost love and one, it’s like you just look at the guy and say: ‘Wow, this is kind of next-level s**t.’ “Excuse my language. I don’t know what else to say. It was almost fun to witness at the same time.” Ruud added it was “as near as perfect” a performance he has witnessed first-hand from a tennis player. Sinner will now face American Tommy Paul in Friday’s semifinal. No. 11 seed Paul hasn’t had the best of luck off the court this week. He told reporters after his quarterfinal win over Poland’s Hubert Hurkacz that a couple of missed payments meant his beloved truck, which he called his “baby,” had been repossessed. Paul said he sent his trainer with $1,000 to go and collect the truck in Florida while he competed in Rome. Meanwhile, Sinner’s compatriot Musetti will face Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz in the other men’s semifinal after an impressive 7-6(1), 6-1 win over No. 2 seed Alex Zverev. Musetti boasts a vast repertoire of shots and his game is a joy to behold when in the kind of form he demonstrated against Zverev. His one-handed backhand is especially aesthetic in an era dominated by two-handers. The 23-year-old has enjoyed a successful clay-court season so far, reaching the final in Monte-Carlo, the semifinals in Madrid and now the last four again in Rome. “Full crowd, full stadium, and that’s a big advantage,” Musetti said after his win on Wednesday, per the ATP. “All this week there has been incredible support from the fans. “I felt the adrenaline and energy from the first point, even if it was not an easy start, but I managed to come back and find a way, and that’s the key of this match.” Meanwhile, Paolini is the first Italian woman in 11 years to reach the final of the Italian Open, where she will face America’s Coco Gauff on Saturday. The home favorite earned a 7-5, 6-1 victory against the USA’s Peyton Stearns in Thursday’s semifinal, while Gauff defeated Olympic gold medalist Zheng Qinwen 7-6(3), 4-6, 7-6(4). Should Paolini win on Saturday, she would end a 40-year wait for an Italian woman to win the title. “In the first round I was nervous and in the second also, and maybe again today, but the crowd was unbelievable and they helped me a lot,” Paolini told Sky Sports. “It’s beautiful to play here in Italy and they support us no matter what, so that is the most important thing.” The No. 6 seed has experienced lifting a trophy at her home tournament, clinching the doubles title last year with compatriot Sara Errani, the last Italian woman to reach the singles final in Italy. Paolini and Errani are also both through to the women’s doubles final this year. The Italian pair beat Diana Shnaider and Mirra Andreeva in the semifinal in straight sets on Friday.",

    "content": "beat 6-4, 6-2 in the Italian Open women’s singles final on Saturday to become the first Italian player to win the tournament in 40 years, before repeating the feat in the doubles final on Sunday. In doing so, Paolini became the first woman since Monica Seles in 1990 to win both the singles and doubles titles at the Italian Open, and the first player to do so in any WTA 1000 series tournament since Vera Zvonareva at Indian Wells in 2009. With Italian President Sergio Mattarella in attendance for the match against Gauff, Paolini fed off the energy of the home crowd and looked a class above her opponent to claim what is arguably the biggest win of her career. “It doesn’t seem real to me,” the 29-year-old said, per AP. “I came here as a kid to see this tournament but winning it and holding up this trophy wasn’t even in my dreams.” Neither player could hold their serve across the first three games, but Paolini won the fourth to take a 3-1 lead and was in command for the remainder of the set. The Italian then broke her opponent twice at the beginning of the second set to take a 3-0 lead, before Gauff broke back. But Paolini remained composed, re-establishing her three-game lead in the very next game and cruising through the rest of the set, eventually clinching the victory with a big serve down the middle on her second championship point and raising her arms in celebration. Paolini, runner-up at the French Open and Wimbledon last year, is the first Italian winner at the Italian Open since Raffaella Reggi won the women’s singles tournament in 1985. She is only the fourth Italian winner overall since the tournament began in 1930. The victory means she will move up to fourth in the world rankings ahead of the French Open, which begins on Sunday, May 25. “Maybe I could have served better and put more balls in the court,” said Gauff, who had 55 unforced errors and seven double faults. “I definitely could and can. But she played to win today and she deserved to win.” “With the double faults, it’s something I know I have to improve,” she added. Then, on Sunday, Paolini and Sara Errani, the reigning Olympic champions, twice came from 4-0 down to win the women’s doubles final 6-4, 7-5 against Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens. Men’s world No. 1 Jannik Sinner is hoping to complete a first ever Italian sweep of the Rome singles titles when he faces Carlos Alcaraz later on Sunday. The last Italian man to win the tournament was Adriano Panatta in 1976.",

    "content": "made sure Italy’s celebrations did not continue on Sunday as he earned a statement 7-6(5), 6-1 win over world No. 1 and home favorite to clinch his first title. The Rome crowd had already seen an Italian player lift a trophy on Saturday after ended a 40-year wait for a home winner by beating Coco Gauff in the women’s final in straight sets. But there was to be no historic Italian double as an impressive Alcaraz saved two set points when serving at 5-6 in the opener, before emphatically brushing Sinner aside in the second to seal his seventh Masters 1000 title. “I’m just really happy to get my first Rome (title), hopefully it’s not going to be the last one,” Alcaraz said, per the ATP. “The first thing I want to say is that I’m just really happy to see Jannik back at this amazing level. I’m sure it wasn’t easy for him coming back after three months and making the final of a Masters 1000 in his first tournament. “It’s something insane, so I have to congratulate him.” The defeat ends Sinner’s 26-match unbeaten run, with the Italian last tasting defeat in the final of the China Open in October 2024 to Alcaraz. Sinner was playing in his first tournament since in January after serving a , but the 23-year-old already looks close to his best. The three-time grand slam winner’s form in Rome – in particular during his demolition of – makes Alcaraz’s win all the more eye-catching, especially as the Spaniard was forced to withdraw from his first-round match in Madrid last month with injury. There was no sign of the adductor issue that kept him from playing in his home Masters tournament and Alcaraz says he has “great confidence” heading into this week’s French Open, where he is the defending champion. “I’m proud of myself, with the way I approached the match mentally,” Alcaraz said. “Tactically, I think I played pretty well from the first point until the last one. “I didn’t do a rollercoaster. I maintained my good level throughout the whole match, so I’m really proud about everything I did today. “All eyes are on Paris right now, on Roland Garros. Beating Jannik, winning Rome, both things mix together and give (me) great confidence going to Paris. “I always say: ‘The final is not about playing, the final is about winning.’ I just repeat (that) approach every time I play a final.”",

    "content": "became just the third man in the Open era to win 100 ATP singles titles on Saturday, defeating Hubert Hurkacz 5-7, 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-2) in the final of the Geneva Open. The joins Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer as the only men to have achieved the feat. “I want to thank my wife and my kids for coming for three days only on the school break, cutting the school for one day, just to be with me,” Djokovic said in his on court interview. “My team, the only thing I can say is thank you for being with me in the good times but also in the bad times. Today was very challenging to stay with me on the court because I was going off at you quite a lot … so I want to thank you for staying here and earning with me this victory number 100.” Since claiming his 99th title when he won the gold medal in the men’s singles at the 2024 Olympics in Paris eight months ago, Djokovic has endured a difficult run of form. He has particularly struggled on clay, recently exiting the Monte-Carlo Masters and Madrid Open in his first match of each tournament. And for much of Saturday’s match, it seemed as if the milestone would elude the Serb once again. At 2-2 in the first set, he was unable to capitalize on two break points and that came back to haunt him when Hurkacz took the set thanks to a double fault from Djokovic in the 12th game. But as the match progressed, Djokovic – who turned 38 on Thursday – showed the kind of resolute determination which appeared to have deserted him of late, breaking Hurkacz four times in a tiebreak after each player had held serve throughout the second set. Having been broken by Hurkacz in the first game of the third set, it looked for a long time as though the win was slipping away from Djokovic again. But his quality came to the fore again, and he broke back to make it 4-4 before winning another tiebreak. “I know it’s a bitter taste in the mouth to lose the match like this,” Djokovic told Hurkacz in his on-court interview afterward. “I think that you were definitely for most of the match, the better player.” The victory means that, remarkably, the Serbian’s 100 title comes against a player coached by Nicolas Massú, the Chilean former world No. 9 whom Djokovic beat to win his very first ATP title in 2006. Djokovic will now turn his attention to the French Open, where he will be aiming to win a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam. He faces American Mackenzie McDonald in the first round, which begins on Sunday.",

    "content": "When entrepreneur and started to think about investing in , opposition to the idea came from an unlikely source: His wife, tennis legend . “When I first told Serena I was gonna buy or start a women’s soccer team here in the States, she actually tried to talk me out of it, because I think she had been so exposed to the infrastructure around women’s sports,” explained to . “Because of her lived experience, she actually was trying to talk me out of it because she had to kick down a lot of doors.” Ohanian, who this month purchased a minority stake in England’s , explained that such close proximity to the 23-time grand slam singles champion and her sister, Venus, showed “proof of the business viability of women’s professional sports.” Ohanian was the founding investor of , a Los Angeles-based team that began playing in the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) in 2022 – the top division of the women’s game in the US. The club then became the most valuable women’s professional sports team in the world after a in 2024. Ohanian, whose investment in Chelsea is by British media to be worth more than $26 million for a 10% share of the club, is just one of many putting cash into women’s sports. His investment announcement comes in the same month as the defending WNBA champion New York Liberty reportedly raised capital from investors at $450 million in what is thought to be a record valuation for a professional women’s sports franchise, according to , who cited sources familiar with the deal. Meanwhile, Ohanian’s wife, Serena, is a minority owner of Angel City and Tiger Woods’ and Rory McIlroy’s innovative golf league the , the Miami Dolphins – along with sister Venus – and in March, announced her ownership role in the expansion Canadian WNBA franchise, the Toronto Tempo. Ohanian said that he saw the reluctance of others to invest in women’s soccer as an opportunity. “When experts in a space try to talk me out of it, that’s actually when I tend to lean in more because it tells me that sort of dissent or that pushback is usually where there’s a tremendous opportunity for innovation and progress,” he said. The 42-year-old Ohanian announced the deal to invest in Chelsea Women earlier in May, saying he was “proud” to help the “iconic club” – already one of the most successful teams in women’s soccer – become the most popular Women’s Super League (WSL) team in the US. “I think a lot of well-intentioned people historically have supported women’s sports in a way that … actually held it back because it was viewed too much as charity, or they led with things like, ‘Oh, I’m doing this because I have a daughter,’” he told CNN. “No, I’m doing this because I think these are tremendous athletes.” He added that sports and incredible athletes are going to thrive in a time of growing use of artificial intelligence because “the types of entertainment that are going to endure are the ones that are fundamentally human.” In 2024, Ohanian founded , a women’s-only track and field event that debuted later that year. The event offers $60,000 for race winners and aims to champion female athletes across the world. “One of the north stars for me five years ago – when I started on this journey of building, investing in and around women’s professional sports – has been: This investment isn’t just in the clubs, it’s in the surrounding infrastructure that’s gonna flow through every level of women’s sports. “For 100 years, professional sports has been by men for men. And when there have been women and women’s teams, in many ways, they’ve been literally treated as just small men, which is pretty ridiculous, right?” he explained to CNN Sports. Ohanian said that teams like Chelsea, who this month secured a sixth consecutive WSL title, a domestic treble and remained unbeaten for 22 consecutive games, offer “a chance to show folks something really, really special.” “I’m glad the discourse has now shifted where people are realizing there’s real opportunity here, but there’s still so much more work to be done, and I really believe that this club could and should be the first billion dollar franchise, billion dollar club in women’s sports.” CNN’s Ben Church contributed reporting.",

    "content": "sealed its fourth ever title in thrilling fashion on Friday, defeating Cagliari 2-0 to pip rival to the Scudetto by just one point. Goals from Scott McTominay and Romelu Lukaku either side of halftime propelled Napoli to the win, prompting the city to empty out onto the streets, the night air filling with fireworks, thick red smoke, glowing sparklers, flags, cheers and dancing, euphoric fans. Going into its final game, Napoli held a one-point lead over Inter Milan at the top of the table. The title was within its grasp but there was no room to slip up – only a win would guarantee the club the Scudetto. Across the country, in Lombardy, Inter took an early lead against Como through Stefan de Vrij’s header. Despite enjoying all the early chances against Cagliari, Napoli briefly fell behind in the title race. The tension inside the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium – named for Napoli’s greatest ever player – ratcheted up a notch. This season, McTominay has emerged as a new, unlikely folk hero at Napoli. Surpassing all expectations of him when he joined over the summer from Manchester United, the Scottish midfielder has dragged Napoli to the title and was named the league’s MVP for his efforts. So, it was fitting that McTominay gave Napoli the lead just before halftime on Friday with a brilliant scissor kick from Matteo Politano’s cross. That goal ensured he finished the league campaign with 18 goal contributions, the most from any midfielder in their debut Serie A season, per Sky Sports. The people of Naples have embraced McTominay as one of their own, giving him the nickname “McFratm,” which loosely translates as “McBro.” Then, five minutes after halftime, Lukaku found himself on the receiving end of a long, speculative kick downfield, weaved his way past two Cagliari defenders and slotted the ball into the net for a spectacular individual effort. Napoli held on for the win and fireworks began exploding in the city around the stadium as soon as the final whistle was blown. On the pitch, the players threw their manager Antonio Conte into the air. Since taking charge of the club last July, he has turned around its fortunes, taking it from a 10 place finish last season to its second title in three years. In the process, Conte made history, becoming the first coach to win Serie A titles with three different teams, adding this one to sit alongside those he won with Juventus and Inter Milan as well as his Premier League title with Chelsea. “When we got to the stadium, it was honestly difficult to get in, as I don’t know how many people were there,” Conte told reporters, per Reuters, before his press conference was interrupted by singing Napoli players. “I had a slight thought, if we let these people down, it’d be something we carried with us for a long time.”",

    "content": "Sunderland secured promotion to the Premier League on Saturday after defeating Sheffield United 2-1 with an extraordinary injury-time winner in the “most valuable match” in soccer, as the is known. For much of the game, Sunderland was trailing 1-0 after took the lead early on through a sweeping counterattacking move finished off by Tyrese Campbell. But the Blades spurned several chances to put the game beyond Sunderland’s reach and the Black Cats equalized in the 76th minute as Eliezer Mayenda rifled the ball into the net. And 19-year-old Tom Watson completed Sunderland’s unlikely comeback deep into injury-time, propelling one of English soccer’s most historic clubs back into the Premier League for the first time since 2017 and sending its fans inside Wembley Stadium into delirium. Since that relegation in 2017, the Black Cats even suffered a four-season-long stint in League One, an ignominy depicted in the popular Netflix show “Sunderland ‘Til I Die.” They eventually won promotion back to the Championship in 2022 and will now join Leeds United and Burnley in securing promotion back to the Premier League this season. “I think my celebration says it all,” Watson, who is leaving Sunderland to join Brighton, told broadcaster Sky Sports. “Just look around, it’s unbelievable. We’ll see each other in the Premier League next year. “I’ve been thinking about it for weeks. My story was written when I came off the bench. I couldn’t have pictured it any better.” Sunderland was on the back foot from the very start of the game – in the opening two minutes, its club captain Luke O’Nien was forced off with a shoulder injury as he tried to defend against Kieffer Moore’s header. The Black Cats’ only consolation as O’Nien walked off the pitch was that some brilliant goalkeeping from Anthony Patterson prevented Sheffield United from taking the lead. But in the 25th minute, the Blades went ahead when Gustavo Hamer poached the ball from a wayward Sunderland corner, scampered upfield and found Campbell who chipped the ball into the net. With the chance to play in the Premier League the prize on offer, the celebrations after every goal were fraught with emotion and, in this instance, Campbell was buried under a pile of Sheffield United players. Just 10 minutes later the Blades thought they’d doubled their lead when Harrison Burrows found the back of the net after Sunderland’s defense cleared a corner only as far as the edge of the box. However, the goal was disallowed after a Video Assistant Referee check determined Vini Souza was in an offside position. And the Blades were left to rue that miss opportunity, as well as another in the 69th minute when Patterson once again stopped a near-certain goal. The momentum was beginning to turn and seven minutes later Sunderland strung a series of passes together that scythed through the Sheffield United midfield, allowing Mayenda to find the back of the net. O’Nien, his arm in a sling, joined his teammates in celebrating, later telling Sky Sports he “covered more distance” celebrating his team’s two goals than he did playing. The Black Cats kept pressing and, in the 95th minute, they had their reward when Watson pounced on a loose pass and sent the ball into the net for the late winner, ensuring that Sunderland became the first team in 29 years to win a Championship play-off final after trailing at halftime.",

    "content": "The last time won the , the team’s star Leah Williamson was a 10-year-old mascot, clutching a ball as she accompanied the players onto the pitch. On Saturday, 18 years later, Williamson’s defensive brilliance helped the Gunners to their next European triumph as they stunned two-time defending champion and pre-game favorite Barcelona 1-0 in the final. This was an all-conquering Barça team, one which was playing in a record-equaling fifth consecutive final, had once again dominated Spain’s Liga F and had scored 44 goals in the Champions League this season, just one shy of the all-time record. Few expected Arsenal to dethrone such a team. “We knew that we were the underdogs and it’s rare that you get to play in a game when there’s so little pressure on you,” Williamson said afterward, per the club’s website. “So we just went out and we said we were going to enjoy it.” Armed with such an attitude and unencumbered by expectation, Arsenal produced one of its great performances, Stina Blackstenius’ goal in the 74th minute proving the difference between the two teams. Blackstenius had been on the pitch for less than 10 minutes when she made her decisive contribution, collecting Beth Mead’s reverse pass through Barça’s defense inside the box, controlling it with one touch and firing it across the face of the goal into the net. That came shortly after she had engineered another chance, pouncing on a loose pass and taking on the defense only for her shot to be blocked by goalkeeper Cata Coll. And, in front of thousands of Gunners fans who had traveled to Lisbon, Arsenal’s defense dug in and clung on, even when seven minutes of injury time were added. “It’s probably the hardest game we’ve played so far,” Arsenal manager Renée Slegers told reporters afterward. “With all the quality Barcelona has, with all their rotations and all their individual threat, there was so much to deal with today and the players had to make decisions every single second on the pitch.” Barcelona had chances of its own – the Spanish team took 14 shots in the second half alone – but each effort bounced off the woodwork, narrowly missed the goal or was batted away by Daphne van Domselaar. The Spanish giant was much improved in the second half after looking off-color before halftime, lacking the precision of a team seeking a fourth European title in five years. That was epitomized in the 22nd minute when the Arsenal players thought they had gone 1-0 up after Irene Paredes inadvertently tapped the ball into the net as she tried to clear it away before the goal was ruled out following a VAR check for offside. “We weren’t at our best level, but we gave all we had. In situations like that, football sometimes punishes you,” Aitana Bonmatí, last year’s Ballon d’Or winner, said, per AP. “We need to push onwards and use what’s happened here to our benefit in the future.”",

    "content": "tied a PGA Tour record to claim his first of 2025 with a blistering win at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson at TPC Craig Ranch in McKinney, Texas, on Sunday. The world No. 1 of 253, matching the mark set by Justin Thomas at the 2017 Sony Open and Ludvig Åberg at the 2023 RSM Classic. He also broke the CJ Cup 72-hole record of 259 set by Steven Bowditch in 2015. Scheffler closed out his with a final-round 63 to finished at 31-under for the tournament, eight shots clear of second-placed Erik van Rooyen. The American called the dominant victory “very special,” explaining afterwards that he grew up coming to watch the tournament and even made his PGA Tour debut at the CJ Cup. “This is a golf course where you can kind of make a run, and I knew that I couldn’t just coast to the finish line today,” the 28-year-old told reporters afterwards. “I knew I had to put together a good round. “Let’s say I played super safe today and shot even par, Erik would have chased me down there. I knew I had to get out and make some birdies. Did a good job on the front nine and was able to play some consistent golf here. I made the mistake on 3, but responded really well with a bunch of birdies after that. All together, a good week.” Scheffler entered Sunday’s final round with an eight-shot lead and nobody came within six shots of him over the final 18 holes as he put in an inspired display to remain atop the leaderboard. The only downside on a successful outing in Texas was missing an opportunity to break the record outright after he carded a bogey on the par-three 17th and a par on the final hole to mean he had to settle for a share of the historic mark. Thomas, who , humorously texted CBS analyst Colt Knost when Scheffler was on the 17th: “Tell Scottie to just make bogey-par and tie my 72-hole record, please … 31-under is just fine. Take pride in that.” The victory is Scheffler’s 14th on the PGA Tour but first of the year. In the past three years combined, he had already won 10 times before May, including two victories. Having missed last year’s CJ Cup for the birth of his first child Bennett, Scheffler held his son as he celebrated the victory and fought back tears as he addressed the crowd. When why emotions caught up to him, Scheffler explained that this tournament is ingrained in him as a golfer – TPC Craig Ranch is close enough to his house that Scheffler slept in his own bed during the duration of the tournament. “When I think about this tournament, I think about a lot of different stuff. I grew up coming to watch it,” he said. “This was my first start on the PGA Tour when I was in high school. The girl I was dating at the time is now my wife. We have one son. My sister was caddying for me at the time. She was here today. She has two kids. “My family was all able to be here, and it was just really, really special memories, and I think at times it all comes crashing down to me at once. We have a lot of great memories as kids coming to watch this tournament. I just dreamed to be able to play in it, and it’s more of a dream to be able to win it. “I never really got this far to be honest with you. I always just dreamed of playing golf on the PGA Tour. I would come out on the driving range and watch these guys practice, hitting their brand-new range balls. That’s all I wanted to do was come out here and play a golf course that was in great shape and compete on the best golf courses in the world against the best players. “It really is a lifetime of hard work and sacrifice from a lot of the people that I have around me, and my family is obviously the starter for that.”",

    "content": "Jim Best admits that he’s not the best , but he does spend most of his time on some of the world’s best golf courses. He says he struggles to keep his ball on the fairway, and yet he’s made his living from the game. He’s got tremendous feel around the greens – but not in the way you might be thinking, and he’s usually about 15 under, but we’re not talking about his scorecard. That’s because Jim Best is a diver who finds your and turns them into a lucrative business. At one stage, he was working at 65 courses up the Eastern seaboard of the United States, salvaging up to two million balls a year. He’s since pared it back to less than a dozen courses, but – site of the Players Championship – has always been his favorite, especially around the . “I get a lot of balls out of there,” he explains to , saying that annually he can salvage around 70,000 balls from that particular body of water alone. “I mean I go there, and I make money, like a harvesting a crop, like a field of corn.” It’s a career that began almost by accident. While studying at the University of South Florida in 1993, he was along a cart path when he spotted some lost balls in the woods. He found enough to fill his backpack, washed them in his sink and then sold them to the golf shop across the road from his apartment. “So that’s how I fed myself! I’m like, ‘Dude, I got dinner for the whole week in just a couple of hours!’” Best graduated and went to work in the cell tower business, but he kept hawking balls on the side, selling them wherever he happened to be working: “Every single body was interested in cheap product, so in ’98, I decided I wanted to give this a go.” He got himself certified as a diver and entered into contracts with various golf courses for the exclusive rights to salvage their balls. Above the waterline, the iconic 17th green of TPC Sawgrass looks idyllic, but it’s much less so beneath the surface. Best says the murky water can be full of tannins and algae and, once he’s started reaching for balls on the bottom, the disturbed silt reduces visibility dramatically. Fortunately, he knows the topography at the bottom just as well as the golfers can read their putts above him on the grass. “Once you do it a few times, your mind it without it. It’s anywhere from six to 15 feet deep and maybe 20 feet in the middle, and there’s little hills and stuff like that,” he tells CNN. He’ll bring a couple of oxygen tanks to each dive and spend between five and six hours in the water, sometimes bagging as many as 6,000 balls around the 17th alone. “But you never get them all, ever,” he says. “I don’t care how good you are.” Balls that are missed are unlikely to be of much use when they are eventually recovered. Best says that around 10% of his recovery gets trashed because the water permeates the membrane of the ball, causing the gases inside to expand. Once he’s dived every single body of water on a course, he’ll return to his warehouse to wash and sort the balls by make, model and quality. Everything will then be sold – unless he’s stumbled across a famous ball. In 2005, around the time that won the fourth of his five titles, Best found one of his balls at TPC Sawgrass. “It was elation,” he recalls of his emotions when he saw the markings denoting the player many consider to be the greatest of all time. Gracing his collection is another of Tiger’s golf balls, found at Doral, one from – marked RORS – a couple from Phil Mickelson, and balls that he believes once belonged to and Peyton Manning. Arguably his most treasured find, though, is a Titleist Pro V 1x marked with the number 45. “I’ve got ’s ball; it’s marked Donald J. Trump in red letters, I don’t know how that gets eclipsed,” Best says. “I mean, you may not like President Trump, but it’s just the fact that there’s only one of him.” A watery grave for your golf ball is an Aladdin’s Cave for Best. Along with the thousands of balls he’s able to recycle, he’s also stumbled across cellphones, cameras, sunglasses, sunhats and even putters. “I’ve gotten five or six Scotty Cameron putters,” he beams. “They’re just flung out there!” While he can’t be sure exactly how some of the other items found their way into the water, it’s a safe bet that the clubs were tossed in a fit of anger. “It’s just a bit of rage,” he posits, “and then I’m sure it’s a bit of remorse when they get to the clubhouse!” Based on where in the water he retrieves the balls, Best estimates that most players only just miss the green, and he’s had more than a few close shaves of his own. “A few years ago, there was an 11-foot and a nine-foot around the green where I was diving. I worked as long as I felt OK and they were staying at bay; if they got too curious, I got out.” However, while diving at other courses, he hasn’t been so fortunate. He says he’s been bitten on the ankle by a “four-footer.” “I was 18 (feet) under when he grabbed me. Their teeth are very, very sharp, especially the little ones, like a Doberman Pinscher with sharper teeth and a stronger bite.” On another occasion, he says that an alligator “bum rushed” into his oxygen tank and “busted his mouth up.” But his biggest “Oh crap” moment came in 2007 at Florida’s Innisbrook Golf Resort, when he says a 14-foot alligator raised its body out of the water on the Island Course and began growling, with its body reverberating and water flying off its back. Best’s dive buddy Pascal was diving underwater, oblivious to the danger. “Totally the (most scared) I’ve been in my life,” he says, “The hardest thing I had to do was get back in the water and get my guy out. I almost didn’t do it, but I was like, ‘Either I’m a real man or I’m not.’” So, the next time somebody’s tee shot splashes into the water at 17 at Sawgrass, remember this: while it might signal the end of a player’s challenge for the tournament, it’s likely just the beginning of a whole new adventure for that little ball and the man who might find it.",

    "content": "They say doesn’t really get going until the second nine on Sunday. The coveted Green Jacket has been won and lost many times over the years especially when the iconic three holes known as Amen Corner loom large. At Quail Hollow – the host venue for this year’s – there’s another trio of holes that have been conspiring to make plenty in the field here in sweat profusely. And it’s not just down to the sweltering temperatures out there on the course! The last three holes at this famous Charlotte venue are known as the Green Mile. For some, it’s one of the most difficult closing sequence of holes in the sport. In total, they measure just under 1,250 yards. The par-4 16th is a gargantuan 529 yards. It’s followed by a 223-yard par-3 and the closing hole – also a par 4 – comes in at 494 yards. Water is a clear and present danger across all three holes. Simply put, it’s a brutal test of every golfer’s resolve and patience. Just ask Bryson DeChambeau. He was at 8-under par and making a real charge late in the day Saturday before the perils of the Green Mile kicked in. After two straight birdies, then came a bogey at 16 and a double bogey at 17. ”It was just a tale of the wind going into me instead of downwind. It cost me three shots and that’s what happens here at Quail Hollow,” the US Open champion said. The 31 year-old, who plays on the LIV Golf circuit, doesn’t feel he did a whole lot wrong en route to a 2-under par third round 69 which only served to increase his frustrations. ”That’s why golf is the worst four-letter word in the world,” DeChambeau lamented. The top-ranked player in the men’s game is Scottie Scheffler. But even he is well aware of the threat posed by the Green Mile, although he navigated it well on Saturday as he powered his way into a three shot lead. “The approach shot into 16 is really tough. The tee shot on 17 is really tough. Then you’ve got 2 really challenging shots on 18 with the water on the left side,” Scheffler said. “There’s no real breathers in that stretch of holes and should make for a fun finish.” Fun is perhaps not the word Scheffler would have chosen after Thursday’s opening round during which he, the recently-crowned Masters champion Rory McIIroy and this tournament’s defending champion Xander Schauffele all double-bogeyed 16, albeit while battling demanding course conditions following the deluge of rain earlier in the week. McIIroy knows this course like the back of his hand. He’s won four times at Quail Hollow during his storied career but even he found himself having to avoid a double bogey at the last on Friday to stay in the tournament for the weekend. In the end, the five-time Major winner achieved his goal but only after a bogey following one at 17 too. Or take the plight of Justin Thomas who was the winner the last time the PGA Championship was played at Quail Hollow in 2017. Thomas – who won recently in South Carolina – failed to make the cut after two untimely bogeys in his last three holes. The Green Mile is not all doom and gloom though. It can even at times provide players with a big break when it comes to a stray rake. That was the experience of Venezuela’s Jhonattan Vegas who led the tournament through the first two rounds. On Friday, the South American’s drive at 17 was well off target before it struck a rake near a greenside bunker and then flew onto the green from where he would save par. “It was one of those things that happens in the sport. Sometimes you get a sprinkler head that goes out-of-bounds or the cart path that goes out-of-bounds or sometimes you hit a rake that goes on the green,” the four-time PGA Tour winner reflected. “It’s just part of the game, and you’ve just got to enjoy it all,” he added. Or how about the Ryan Gerard approach? The young American is playing in his first PGA Championship in his home state too. Gerard attended the University of North Carolina and as a college golfer, there was one sure way to try and conquer that daunting closing hole at Quail Hollow. “I’ll give you a fun anecdote. In 2018, so six months after the PGA, we came out here as preparation for the NCAA nationals, and our coach made all six of us go on 18 tee and everyone had to play the 18th hole until all six made a par and at the same time in the same group,” the 25 year-old told reporters. “So, we were out there for quite a while. I learned a lot about the 18th hole on that day, and I hope that carries forward into this week.” There’s no question other factors will come into play during what’s sure to be a tension-filled final round but we can be sure of one thing. It’s highly likely Quail Hollow’s notoriously demanding finishing stretch will go a long way in determining who will lift the famed Wanamaker Trophy come Sunday evening.",

    "content": "It was at this very tournament a year ago, made national headlines following his arrest. A year later, the World No. 1 won his first at Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte, North Carolina, trading in a mugshot and a jail cell for the famous . He finished Sunday’s final round at 11-under par, five strokes ahead of Bryson DeChambeau, Davis Riley and Harris English. Despite bogeying on the final hole, Scheffler celebrated by spiking his hat on the ground, embracing his caddie, Ted Scott, and then quickly found his wife, Meredith, and son in the crowd. It is the 28-year-old Scheffler’s third career major win with the first two coming at the Masters in 2022 and 2024. Scheffler told CNN he felt “a little on the ropes” on the front nine. “This golf course will keep you on your toes,” Scheffler said. “It was weird because at 7, 8, 9, I felt like I hit really good tee shots. And I looked up and it was 30 yards left where I was looking which was a bit unsual. Making the turn, I kind of squared my shoulders up and I hit a really good tee ball at 10, a really good tee ball at 11. After that, I did a really good job at executing on a lot of fairways, a lot of greens. Played a really good nine holes when I really needed too.” Scheffler added that it was ‘really hard to put into words” when asked by CNN’s Patrick Snell to reflect on his journey from his first major win, to becoming father and now winning his third major. You know (Meredith) and I were talking this morning, we still feel like we’re in high school. I feel like we’re in high school yesterday. We just started dating and all of a sudden you know life out here is pretty cool right now,” Scheffler said. “This is a lot of fun. But at the end of the day life at home for us is pretty much the same. You know we have a pretty good little life and we have great friends at home and I’m looking forward to getting home and celebrating with them.” Scheffler also joins Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus as the only players to win three career majors and 15 PGA Tour titles. The 2025 season did not start off too kindly for Scheffler. A self-described resulted in surgery on his hand, forcing him to delay the start of his season. Scheffler would make his season debut in late January at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am in Northern California. He would then go winless until two weeks ago, when he took home a victory at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson at TPC Craig Ranch in McKinney, Texas. Scheffler joined Seve Ballesteros as the only golfers in the past 100 years to win each of his first three majors by more than three strokes. But it wasn’t an easy round for world’s best. Scheffler came into the fourth and final round with a three-stroke lead but after three bogeys in the front nine, his lead quickly disappeared. LIV Golf star Jon Rahm surged ahead of him, with the Spaniard looking to win his third major. However, the 2021 US Open and 2023 Masters winner, completely faltered in the back nine especially on Quail Hollow’s infamous Green Mile where he bogeyed once and double-bogeyed twice to fall to 2-over par on the day and a tie for 8th place. As Rahm fell, Scheffler arose past his early struggles, sinking back-to-back birdies on holes 14 and 15 to reclaim the lead and never looked back. The 30-year-old, former Arizona State Sun Devil Rahm, said this was a position he has never been in when asked how he would “heal” from this. “I think it’s the first time I’ve been in position to win a major that close and haven’t done it. The only times I think I’ve been in the lead in a major on a Sunday, I’ve been able to close it out, and this is a very different situation,” Rahm told reporters after the round. “So I don’t know exactly. But if it’s ever a time, that’s what family’s for is the best. Luckily I’m going to get home maybe on time to get the kids to bed or not, I’m not sure. To them, whatever I did today, win or lose, they don’t care. So that’s always a good perspective. … But I just need to get over it, get over myself. It’s not the end of the world. It’s not like I’m a doctor or a first responder, where somebody if they have a bad day, truly bad things happen. I’ll get over it. I’ll move on.” Following the win Sunday, Scheffler quipped he had a few “jokes” that he would keep to himself about his experience last year with the arrest. Despite being pressured to say them, Scheffler said it was “not a good idea” but expanded on why it was “sweet” to be sitting with the trophy a year later. “Last year sometimes, it still doesn’t almost feel real. It really doesn’t. It’s just one of those deals that I really don’t know how to describe it. But I can tell you it’s very sweet sitting here with the trophy this year,” Scheffler added. Last year, trying to drive around the scene of a fatal crash ahead of his tee time at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky. He had been charged with felony second-degree assault on a police officer and the lesser charges of third-degree criminal mischief, reckless driving and disregarding signals from officers directing traffic, Jefferson County court records showed. The charges were later dismissed. In what Scheffler called a “severe miscommunication in a chaotic situation,” adding he held “no ill will” toward the detective who arrested him, he ultimately finished eight shots behind the winner, Xander Schauffele, for a share of eighth place. Scheffler can begin his quest for a fourth career major win next month at the US Open at the Oakmont Country Club in Oakmont, Pennsylvania. This story has been updated with additional reporting.",

The Japanese superstar blasted a 389-foot shot to left field in the bottom of the sixth inning at Dodger Stadium against the Arizona Diamondbacks, but it was little too late for the reigning World Series champions. Ohtani’s homer cut Arizona’s lead to 7-2 on the evening, but the D-Backs eventually prevailed 9-5. The defeat is the Dodgers fourth in a row – three to their city rivals, the Angels, and one to Arizona – which has allowed the Philadelphia Phillies to overtake them at the top of the National League. Despite their poor results, Ohtani has still routinely shown his excellence, with his 17th home run of the season the main positive on a disappointing evening in California. The reigning NL MVP now has one more homer than Phillies left fielder Kyle Schwarber – who hit a massive, 466-foot shot in the ninth inning of Philadelphia’s 9-3 win over the Colorado Rockies on Monday – and two more than star Aaron Judge and the Seattle Mariners’ Cal Raleigh. Ohtani also has 10 stolen bases so far this season, potentially putting him in-line to . On Monday night, Arizona’s Lourdes Gurriel Jr., Gabriel Moreno and Geraldo Perdomo each hit two-run home runs and right-handed pitcher Brandon Pfaadt gave up three runs and three hits over six innings to down the Dodgers. The fans inside Dodgers Stadium booed when the D-Backs raced into a 7-0 lead before two home runs from Mookie Betts and Ohtani’s homer reduced the deficit, but it wasn’t enough for the Dodgers, who saw Arizona score two more runs in the eighth to put the game out of reach. “It’s tough facing an All-Star lineup (in) almost back-to-back (starts),” Pfaadt said afterwards, . He added: “Credit to the offense for putting me in that position. Got out early and we were able to just attack the zone and up until the sixth inning. (Three) homers, but that’s OK, because we had the lead and we were just attacking guys.” The Dodgers and Diamondbacks will play twice more over the coming days.",

    "content": "Former major league outfielder/first baseman Darin Ruf is suing the Cincinnati Reds for damages after he suffered a career-ending injury while crashing into an uncovered tarp roller at Great American Ballpark two years ago. The lawsuit filed Thursday in the Hamilton County (Ohio) Court of Common Pleas charges the Reds with negligence in failing to maintain safe field conditions and specifically cites the presence of the unpadded metal tarp roller. “This didn’t need to happen,” Ruf said in a statement. “I wish it didn’t happen. Players shouldn’t have to worry about hidden hazards like that on a major league field.” Ruf was playing first base for Milwaukee when he was injured during the third inning of the Brewers’ 5-4, 11-inning victory over the Reds on June 2, 2023. In the third inning, Ruf was chasing a foul pop when his knee hit the end of the tarp roller. According to the complaint, Ruf suffered “permanent and substantial deformities to his knee.” Ruf went on the 60-day injured list and never played in the major leagues again. Ruf’s complaint says the end of the tarp roller was made of sharp metal and had no protective cushioning or cap. “This was an obvious and avoidable risk,” Tad Thomas, Ruf’s attorney, said in a release announcing the lawsuit. “There are basic safety protocols every MLB team should follow. Leaving an unpadded metal roller on the edge of the field is inexcusable.” The Reds had no immediate response to a message seeking comment. Ruf is seeking punitive and compensatory damages. The complaint says the Reds didn’t take reasonable precautions to keep the stadium safe and also are liable for the negligent acts of the grounds crew’s “reckless” conduct. Ruf, 38, played in the majors from 2012-23 with the Philadelphia Phillies (2012-16), San Francisco Giants (2020-22, 2023), New York Mets (2022) and Brewers (2023).

    "content": "The will go to a more straightforward way of filling the bracket next season, announcing Thursday that it will place teams strictly on where they are ranked instead of moving pieces around to reward conference champions. Ten conference commissioners and ’s athletic director came to the unanimous agreement they needed to shift the model that drew complaints last season. The new format will no longer guarantee an opening bye week for the four highest-ranked champions, reserving that benefit for the four top-ranked teams in general. The change was widely expected after last season’s jumbled bracket gave byes to Big 12 champion Arizona State and Mountain West champion Boise State, even though they were ranked 12th and ninth, respectively, by the playoff selection committee. That system made the rankings and the seedings in the tournament two different things and resulted in some matchups — for instance, the quarterfinal between top-ranked Oregon and — that came earlier than they otherwise might have. “After evaluating the first year of the 12-team Playoff, the CFP Management Committee felt it was in the best interest of the game to make this adjustment,” said Rich Clark, executive director of the CFP. The five highest-ranked conference champions will still be guaranteed spots in the , meaning it’s possible there could be a repeat of a different sort of shuffling seen last season when CFP No. 16 Clemson was seeded 12th in the bracket after winning the Atlantic Coast Conference. That ended up costing 11th-ranked Alabama a spot in the playoff. Under the new arrangement, the four top-ranked conference champions will still receive $8 million for their leagues – representing the $4 million they earn for making the playoff and $4 million for advancing to the quarterfinals. “That was the commissioners’ way of – at least for this year – holding to the commitment that they have made financially to those teams, those conference champions in particular, that would have been paid those amounts under the former system that we used last year,” Clark told ESPN. Southeastern Conference (SEC) commissioner Greg Sankey was among those who pushed for the change in the upcoming second year of the 12-team playoff, though he remained cautious about it being approved because of the unanimous vote needed. Smaller conferences had a chance to use the seeding issue as leverage for the next set of negotiations, which will come after this season and could include an expansion to 14 teams and more guaranteed bids for certain . The SEC and Big Ten will have the biggest say in those decisions. As it stands, this will be the third different playoff system for college football in the span of three years. For the 10 years leading into last season’s inaugural 12-team playoff, the CFP was a four-team affair. The seeding change was first reported by ESPN, which last year signed a six-year, $7.8 billion deal to televise the expanded playoff. The playoff for the upcoming season begins December 19 on the campuses of the teams ranked 5-8. All games beginning with the quarterfinals will be at neutral sites, ending with the title game on January 19 at Hard Rock Stadium outside Miami. A look at possible first-round matchups had straight seeding been in play last ( ): · No. 12 Clemson at No. 5 Notre Dame. The Tigers still would have gotten in despite being ranked 16th. Notre Dame, a team without a conference, could benefit from this new arrangement because it is now eligible for a bye. (No. 5 Texas 38, No. 12 Clemson 24). · No. 11 Arizona State at No. 6 Ohio State. The Sun Devils face a juggernaut instead of receiving a first-round bye. (No. 6 Penn State 38, No. 11 SMU 10). · No. 10 SMU at No. 7 Tennessee.

    "content": "A day after being crowned NBA MVP, led the to a 118-103 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves to open up a 2-0 series lead in the Western Conference Finals. Gilgeous-Alexander was presented with the Michael Jordan Trophy ahead of Game 2 on Thursday, before putting up 38 points – tying his career playoff high – eight assists and three steals to put the Thunder in the driving seat in this series. The 26-year-old has now scored at least 30 points in five straight playoff games. “It felt really good,” Gilgeous-Alexander said of putting in that performance after receiving the award. “I feel like my emotions were so high that I was a little bit tired out there, especially at the start. I was a little too juiced up. “A special moment. I’m happy we won so I can really enjoy the last couple of days and soak it all up. That really helps. Shout out to the team. We played well again tonight and head to Minnesota up 2-0.” “Early, I just wanted to lean on my teammates,” he added. “I thought about coming out and forcing the first couple of shots, but I was like: ‘Nah, that’s probably not the way to go. I wanted to just let the game come to me, lean on my teammates, play through them, play off them.” Thursday’s win again showcased the depth OKC boasts behind Gilgeous-Alexander, with Jalen Williams continuing his rapid rise to stardom with 26 points, 10 rebounds and five assists. Chet Holmgren had one of his best games of this postseason, adding 22 points and four rebounds. The game was a relatively close affair until the Thunder – as they did in Game 1 – used a third-quarter blitz to blow the T-Wolves away. This time it was a 14-2 run that helped Oklahoma City take complete control, eventually pushing the lead to as much as 24. The Timberwolves closed the gap to 10 in the fourth, but the Thunder kept them quite comfortably at arm’s length. Anthony Edwards doubled his shot attempts for the Timberwolves after saying he needed to shoot more following Game 1, posting 32 points, nine rebounds and six assists. Jaden McDaniels added 22 points for the Timberwolves, while Nickeil Alexander-Walker – Gilgeous-Alexander’s cousin – had 17 off the bench. Julius Randle, who was quickly earning the ‘Playoff Julius’ moniker, had his first poor performance of the postseason, scoring just six points on 2-of-11 shooting. “I thought again we didn’t close the half very well,” Minnesota head coach Chris Finch said. “I thought if we close the half better, then we don’t put outselves on such a razor’s edge in the third. “We only had six turnovers at halftime. We had a few more in the third quarter, missed some shots, didn’t finish at the basket and that led to to a bunch of stuff, an early attack mode for them. “Every minute in this series is a chance to find something,” Finch added. “So we’re going to go back home as a good team at home, so we’re going to fight for Game 3. Heads up, look at the tape and get ready for Game 3.” Game 3 is on Saturday in Minnesota, where the Timberwolves have lost just one of their last 10 games and are 4-1 this postseason.",

    "content": "exploded for 39 points as the beat the 114-109 on Friday night to open up a 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference finals. The three-time All-Star’s playoff career-high points total was added to by Myles Turner, who had 16 points, and Tyrese Haliburton, who had 14 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds. The Pacers’ sixth consecutive win on the road leaves them in a commanding position ahead of their return to Indiana for Game 3, needing just two victories to reach what would be only their second ever NBA Finals. They lost in six games to the Los Angeles Lakers in 2000. Siakam insisted, however, that he and his teammates were not getting distracted by the prospect of writing their names in franchise history. “We focus on ourselves, man,” said the Cameroonian, who was an NBA champion in 2019 with the Toronto Raptors. “We got a long way to go, and it’s only gonna get tougher for us. We’ve just got to stick to the plan. We worry about one game, we’re not really thinking ahead. We focus on Game 3 at home.” On a night when no other Pacer had more than five baskets, Indiana had to rely on the 31-year-old, particularly early on when he scored all of the team’s first 11 points. “Special game. In the first half, he was the guy that got us going, and got us through some difficult stretches,” said Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle. “It’s hard to score that number of points in a game like this, where you always have a physical matchup defensively, and there’s a guy crashing and flying at the basket. But he did a phenomenal job.” The game could not have been any tighter at the end of the third quarter, with the teams tied on 81. A 13-4 run for the Pacers to begin the fourth put them in control, and they kept the Knicks at arm’s length for much of the remainder of the game. But, after Siakam made it 110-100 with 2:45 remaining, New York – propelled by Jalen Brunson who had 36 points and 11 assists on the night – suddenly went on a 9-0 run to come within one point with 14 seconds left. For a moment it looked like the Knicks might flip the script after the Pacers had mounted an incredible comeback in Game 1 on Wednesday night. But two free throws from each of Aaron Nesmith and Turner, either side of a missed three-point attempt by Brunson, sealed the victory for Indiana. The Knicks now have it all to do – no team in conference finals history has ever lost the first two games at home and gone on to win the series, per AP. A dramatic day of sports in Indiana will see Game 3 take place on Sunday night, just hours after the Indy 500.",

So just trying to exceed their energy, or match it, at least. That was the most important thing today and I think we did that.” Also crucial to the win were Julius Randle, who scored 24, and rookie Terrence Shannon Jr., who impressed with 15 points in just 13 minutes. “Huge,” said Randle when asked about Shannon’s performance. “We knew that we would need him this series, and coach obviously has a lot of trust in him. So, for him to be ready for his moment and come in and give us the lift he did – he brought a lot of energy to the game, intensity – he was just a huge boost for our team today.” Such was the contribution of the likes of Shannon that Minnesota’s bench actually outscored the Thunder’s starters 66-49 on the night. After two defeats in Oklahoma, the Wolves clearly relished returning to Target Center, where they have lost just one of their last 11 games. Up by 34 in the third quarter, Randle could be seen shouting the words “We home now!” repeatedly in the direction of the Minnesota crowd. By that point, the contest had been over for some time. Oklahoma City has the best defense in the NBA, but found itself down quickly when a 12-0 run in the first quarter put the Wolves up 25-9. By the end of the quarter it was 34-14, and from early in the second quarter onward, the Thunder never got within 22 points of the home team. After scoring 69 points across the first two games of the series, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who was named NBA MVP earlier this week, could only manage 14 points on 4-for-13 shooting. With 4:25 remaining in the third quarter and the Thunder down by 38, Thunder head coach Mark Daigneault conceded and subbed out his star man – much to the delight of the home crowd, which had booed him incessantly throughout. “We just didn’t bring it from an energy and focus standpoint,” Gilgeous-Alexander admitted afterward. “They just came out with a sense of urgency and we didn’t.” The Wolves will be hoping to make home advantage count again and tie the series when the teams meet in Game 4 on Monday night.",

    "content": "The is broadcast live on television every year as millions tune in and hundreds of thousands more attend in person to revel in the hoopla of it all. It’s a far cry from the event’s humble beginnings, when the player picked first didn’t even know it was happening and soon walked away from the game without ever earning a cent. There are no tackles or touchdowns, but the draft has become one of the biggest sports events of the year, because the fans know that a three-day event in April could impact the fortunes of their teams for years to come. Two-hundred-fifty-seven players will be drafted this week in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and anyone chosen in the first round – which begins at 8 p.m. ET on Thursday – will be set for life with guaranteed multi-million-dollar contracts. It was all very different in the first year of the draft back in 1936 when just 81 players were selected through nine rounds in the inaugural draft. There was little doubt that would go first that year. At 6-foot tall and 195 pounds, the standout player of his class had just received the first ever Heisman Trophy and been named as the Chicago Tribune’s Big 10 player of the year. “He played offense, defense and special teams for Chicago,” explained Landon Bundy, the school’s director of sports information and promotions, to CNN. “He pretty much never came off the field and he played every single position there was on defense.” Bundy said that Berwanger was also the team’s kicker, so he’d often score a touchdown and then kick the extra point himself. “In his Heisman Trophy campaign, it looks like he passed for 405 yards and ran for 577 yards,” Bundy said. “He was the kickoff returner, and he scored six touchdowns, kicking five of the extra points. Basically, he did it all.” “You can say anything superlative about him and I’ll double it,” said his coach Clark Shaughnessy to the Chicago Tribune in 1935. Among his many nicknames, Berwanger was known as “The Man in the Iron Mask,” a reference to the faceguard he wore to protect his twice-broken nose. For more reasons than one, he was hard to forget – the Chicago Tribune polled all the opposing players in Berwanger’s senior season and 104 of the 107 participants concluded that he was the best halfback they’d ever seen. Even Gerald Ford, a future president who won back-to-back national championships with Michigan, would attest to Berwanger’s brilliance and he carried a permanent scar under his left eye to prove it. The New York Times quoted Ford in 2002, “When I tackled Jay one time, his heel hit my cheekbone and opened it up three inches,” he said. Ford has described Berwanger as “one of the greatest athletes I’ve known.” In November 1935, the Downtown Athletic Club in New York recognized Berwanger’s impact on the college game by making him the inaugural recipient of a new trophy given to the “most valuable player east of the Mississippi.” The following year it was renamed after club’s late athletic director, John Heisman. On hearing news of his accolade via a telegram, Berwanger didn’t quite know what to make of it. Speaking about the honor a half-century later he said that it wasn’t really a big deal at the time. “No one at school said anything to me about winning it other than a few congratulations. I was more excited about the trip (to New York) than the trophy because it was my first flight,” he said. Indeed, Berwanger didn’t have much use for the trophy once it was in his possession, which was described as being too wide for a mantlepiece and too large for a coffee table. According to the UChicago magazine, the stiff arm of the player depicted in the trophy spent many years propping the door open at his Aunt Gussie’s house. Three months later, the NFL held its first formalized draft and it was much different than the razzmatazz of the modern day. described it as “no gala, more like a penny-ante poker game. Nine cigar-puffing, mogul wannabees, some of whom were paying their players with IOUs, stubbornly trying to salvage their dream of professional football.” Berwanger told the Courant in 1994 that he was oblivious to the draft at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Philadelphia. “I found out I was drafted by reading it in the newspaper,” he said, “I didn’t even know the draft was going on.” Philadelphia Eagles owner Bert Bell had persuaded his peers to formalize a draft in order to cease the expensive and “self-defeating” bidding wars for college players and he’d proposed that teams should choose players in reverse order from the previous season’s standings. That meant the worst team, Bell’s own 2-9 Eagles, went first and chose Berwanger, quickly dealing his rights to the Chicago Bears. The Eagles didn’t think they’d be able to afford Berwanger’s salary demands, and the Bears owner and coach George Halas soon realized he didn’t have enough money, either. According to the Courant, the two met in the lobby of a downtown hotel in Chicago. “He asked what I wanted,” Berwanger recalled, “and I had my tongue in my cheek. I told him, $25,000 for two years. He looked at my date and said, `Nice to have met you; have a nice time tonight.’ And that was the end of it.” As Brian E Cooper, author of “First Heisman: The Life of Jay Berwanger” described it to the player had made the Bears an offer they simply couldn’t accept. “Jay basically signaled to Halas, by making an extremely high salary ‘demand,’ that he wasn’t really that interested in pro football,” Cooper said. In his obituary in 2002, Berwanger, who had said, “There was no money in pro football then, that was during the Great Depression. I thought I’d have a better future by using my education rather than my football skills.” Having snubbed a career as a professional football player, Berwanger considered competing in the decathlon at the Berlin Olympics that summer, but he chose instead to finish his studies, and he went to work as a foam rubber-salesman. In World War Two, he rose to the rank of lieutenant commander as a Navy flight instructor, and after the war he founded a company that made plastic and sponge-rubber strips for cars and farm machinery. Jay Berwanger Inc. was grossing $30 million a year when he sold it in 1992. Berwanger isn’t the only player to be drafted first in the NFL and not play a game; tragically, the Heisman Trophy’s first black recipient, Ernie Davis, was picked first in 1962 but died of leukemia at the age of 23 and never played for the Cleveland Browns. And although Berwanger never played in the NFL, his name still carries a unique distinction within a league that would become the most lucrative in all of sport. He was the very first pick in the very first draft, but his timing was just a little off. Before his death at the age of 88 in 2002, Berwanger noted that if he’d been drafted even just a few years later, then he would surely have turned professional. And nobody can deny that he was an original. “I still think of myself as the first, kind of like being George Washington,” Berwanger once said.",

    "content": "owners in the league to participate in the competition at the upcoming 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. The proposal said that no more than one player from each team could participate in the event – which is making its Olympic debut as a sport in the City of Angels – as well as providing support for those players involved, including injury protection and salary cap credit. “It’s an incredible honor for any athlete to represent their country in the Olympics, which is the pinnacle of global sport,” NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. “I know first-hand that the inclusion of flag football in the Olympics has sparked a tremendous amount of excitement among NFL players interested in the chance to compete for their country on the world stage. We are thrilled that they will now have that chance.” In order to pass any motion, there needs to be a 75% majority in favor of the rule change among NFL owners, with 24 out of 32 votes needed. Goodell told reporters that the owners voted unanimously in support of letting NFL players participate. The league will work with the players union, International Federation of American Football and relevant Olympic governing bodies on rules for the participation of NFL players. Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson said he was lost for words after hearing the news that he could potentially have the chance to play in the Olympic Games. “To think about the chances of playing in the Olympics and getting a gold medal is a dream,” Jefferson told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday alongside Goodell, Vikings linebacker Brian Asamoah II, NFL EVP of football operations Troy Vincent and EVP of club business and league events Peter O’Reilly. “Just reverting back to being a kid and watching the track and field meets, watching basketball win the gold medal. That’s something that as a kid I always wanted to be a part of, but football wasn’t globally. So now that we’re expanding the game and we’re going more globally it’s pretty cool.” The Vikings star added that being able to say you’re the best in the world is also an incentive behind playing in the 2028 Summer Olympics. The Olympic flag football competition will consist of six men’s and six women’s teams with 10 players each. The game will be five-on-five with the rest of the players serving as substitutes. “Players have expressed to us a great desire for the honor of competing in the Olympics, and we’re excited that our members will be able to represent their country on the highest international stage,” NFL Players Association executive director Lloyd Howell, Jr. said in a statement. “We look forward to working with the league, IFAF, and Olympic authorities on the terms of their participation to ensure players who compete will do so with protections to their health, safety, and job.” Since flag football , an increasing clamor has risen about letting NFL players take part. NFL players have been seen competing in flag football events in recent years, with the Pro Bowl adding a flag football game to its schedule in 2023. “The membership believes that participation by NFL players in flag football during the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California will support such growth and advance several league interests, including increasing fan and public interest in flag football, expanding the global reach of the NFL,” the proposal stated. Flag football is a non-contact version of the traditional game. , it is played by more than 20 million people in more than 100 countries. Instead of tackles, a player is stopped by removing one of the two flags attacked to the ball-carriers waist. Games are five-on-five, with no offensive or defensive lines, and teams able to field a 12-person squad to choose from. “I warmly welcome the outcome of this vote, which promises to add another dimension to what is already shaping up to be a game-changing debut for flag football at the Olympic Games,” IFAF President Pierre Trochet said in a statement. “The National Football League is home to the biggest stars in American football, who come from more and more countries, and now have the opportunity to shine on the greatest stage in world sport, showcasing everything that makes flag football a genuine worldwide phenomenon.” Given the focus on speed and elusiveness to evade opposition trying to grab flags, NFL players such as Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson or Philadelphia Eagles running back could make for valuable editions to Team USA’s squad.",

    "content": "The controversial “tush push” play will not be banned for the upcoming NFL season. A vote on whether the tush push would be permitted going forward was , but its fate was once again up for debate when they reconvened at the Spring League Meeting on Wednesday in Minnesota. In order to pass any motion, there needs to be a 75% majority in favor of the rule change among NFL owners, with 24 out of 32 votes needed. The short-yardage play, which involves the multiple offensive players pushing the quarterback a few yards as the offensive line pushes forward, has been a key element in the Eagles’ success of late, helping the team in its quest to lift the Lombardi Trophy this past season. Dianna Russini of The Athletic 10 teams voted against the ban. The Philadelphia Eagles, who have popularized the play with their success when using it, celebrated the news of the tush push play that has the words “Push On.” The photo the Eagles used with the post, notably, was a Philadelphia game against the Green Bay Packers. The had submitted a proposal to outlaw it on safety and competitiveness grounds. Retired Eagles center Jason Kelce joined the cause for his former team in persuading enough support to avoid the ban, traveling to Minnesota to speak at the meeting. After the vote, Kelce declined to speak to the media, according to reporters on site. “(Kelce) was very articulate and gave his description,” NFL competition committee chairman Rich McKay said. “We heard from the Eagles. Then we heard from a lot of teams in the room. We watched some video and took all the necessary vote counts and realized that was not a rule that was ready to be passed. “I’d say it’s not disappointing for me, for our committee, for the committees that did the work, because it takes 24 votes to pass anything. We don’t set a low bar.” The amended proposal had recommended that pushing or pulling a runner “in any direction at any time” or lifting him to his feet would be banned, meaning the tush push and any other play where the player with the ball is pushed, pulled or lifted would be outlawed. On the eve of the vote, the Packers amended their proposal to focus on the banning of offensive players “assisting the runner.” The tush push rose to prominence a few years ago when the Eagles began deploying it in short-yardage situations. It is a running play in which the ball is snapped to the quarterback, who then plunges forward into the offensive line. While the linemen push forward, the quarterback is then pushed from behind by a tight end and a running back, akin to a scrum in . The combined efforts usually result in a short-yardage gain that is enough for either a first down or a touchdown and the Eagles’ version of the play is usually unstoppable. Eagles quarterback – who is the person with the ball in his hands and is being pushed from behind – has benefitted greatly from this play, with the majority of his 52 rushing touchdowns over the last four seasons coming from the tush push. It became a key driving factor in the team reaching the Super Bowl two years ago and in their title success last season. Like many other aspects across the NFL, other teams have tried to adopt the tush push with varying success, while the Eagles remain the masters of it. Despite the success of the tush push, it has become a controversial play, with some arguing it takes away competitiveness and makes football less exciting. The play, which bears similarities to the old-school quarterback sneak, has also led to safety concerns, with players pushing against one another with all their force in such close proximity. Green Bay, which was beaten handily by the Eagles in the wild-card round of the playoffs as Philadelphia went on to win Super Bowl LIX, was the team to table the motion to ban the play, with CEO and team president Mark Murphy saying the tush push was “bad for the game.” “There is no skill involved and it is almost an automatic first down on plays of a yard or less,” Murphy added. “We should go back to prohibiting the push of the runner. This would bring back the traditional QB sneak. That worked pretty well for Bart Starr and the Packers in the Ice Bowl (in 1967).” The rule proposal submitted by the Packers suggested that the rules change to “prohibit an offensive player from pushing a teammate who was lined up directly behind the snapper and receives the snap, immediately at the snap.” Buffalo Bills head coach Sean McDermott – one of three coaches on the league’s competition committee – said that the Packers’ proposal “takes away the force” of the play, prioritizing player welfare. “Traditional quarterback sneaks have been around for a long time,” he previously has told reporters. “I think that’s the context of it that’s important. Then you know the pushing of it adds the force piece, which again is, I think that exponentially raises my concern.” Ahead of the decision, Eagles stars Jordan Mailata and AJ Brown discussed the play, with both sounding unbothered by the possibility of it being outlawed. Brown said it was “only a one-yard play,” while Mailata went as far to say he hoped it would be banned, solely because of the name. “In terms of them banning the tush push, I hate that name, so I hope they do ban it. It’s a stupid name,” Mailata joked. “But I can’t control it. We can’t control it. “We don’t even worry about it. Right now, we’re just installing our schemes, whatever KP (offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo) is installing that day, that’s what we’re focused on because worrying about if they’re going to ban the tush push or not, ain’t going to win us a championship.”",

    "content": "Indianapolis Colts owner and CEO Jim Irsay has died at the age of 65, the team announced on Wednesday. The Colts said Irsay died “peacefully in his sleep” on Wednesday afternoon. No cause of death was given. “Jim’s dedication and passion for the Indianapolis Colts in addition to his generosity, commitment to the community, and most importantly, his love for his family were unsurpassed,” the team said in a statement. Irsay was one of the league’s most high-profile owners and was remembered as a fierce advocate for Indiana’s capital city. He frequently spoke with reporters and was heavily involved in the Colts’ football operations, making him one of the most visible figures in the NFL during his decades in charge of the franchise. Before becoming the owner of the franchise, Irsay was named general manager at 24 years old, the youngest in team history to ever hold that job, according to the Colts. In 1995, he took a more prominent role within the team before becoming the sole owner in December 1997, after the death of his father, Robert Irsay. During his time with the organization, the Colts won 10 division championships, made two Super Bowl appearances and oversaw the team winning their fourth title in 2006, when  Indianapolis defeated the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI. “Jim will be deeply missed by his family, the Colts organization, and fans everywhere, but we remain inspired by his caring and unique spirit,” the team added. Earlier on Wednesday, Irsay tweeted his support for the Indiana Pacers ahead of Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals against the New York Knicks. “Go PACERS. Good luck to Herb, the entire organization, and our city!,” Irsay . NFL commissioner Roger Goodell called Irsay a “friend” and a “man deeply committed to his family, the game, the Colts, and the Indianapolis community.” “He led with integrity, passion and care for the Colts’ players, coaches and staff, and his courageous work in support of mental health will be a lasting legacy. Outside of football, he was a talented musician and built an extraordinary collection of historical and musical artifacts that he shared with people across the country,” Goodell added. “On behalf of the entire NFL, I extend my heartfelt condolences to Jim’s daughters and their families, and to his many friends throughout the NFL.” Irsay previously struggled with addiction issues; in an interview , Irsay said he had been to rehab at least 15 times and had previously overdosed after mixing multiple drugs at the same time. for operating a vehicle while intoxicated and prescription pills were found in his possession. In December 2023, Irsay was in what a police report described as an overdose. The Colts later responded to the report in a statement, saying Irsay “continues to recover from his respiratory illness.” Irsay always denied that the incident was an overdose. Irsay was an advocate for those dealing with addiction issues and often spoke about getting rid of the stigma around addiction issues.

The eclectic Colts owner also played in often playing at events showcasing items from his collection. Former Colts quarterback and Pro Football Hall of Famer Peyton Manning said he was “heartbroken” to hear about Irsay’s passing. “He was an incredibly generous and passionate owner and I will always be indebted to him for giving me my start in the NFL,” Manning . “His love for the Colts and the city of Indy was unmatched. His impact on the players who played for him will not be forgotten. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and everyone in the Colts community. He will be missed.

    "content": "No one knows the dangers of playing in the NFL more than former quarterback . In 2018, while playing for the Washington Commanders, the veteran signal-caller suffered a gruesome leg injury which would turn his . The severity of the injury was such that he underwent multiple surgeries to treat a spiral and compound fracture to his right tibia and fibula. But then came the real battle. Smith subsequently contracted sepsis – a life-threatening response by the body to infection that can lead to tissue damage, organ failure and death – and nearly had to have his leg amputated. Incredibly, after 21 months out of the sport, he returned to practice in 2020 to complete a remarkable comeback – a story that many NFL fans are aware of. But perhaps not as many people understand just how much pain Smith was in during his recovery. On leaving the hospital to continue his rehabilitation at home, Smith said he and his wife were overwhelmed with the realization that they would have to handle his pain management themselves. They were handed a large folder of instructions and rescue medication if they were to administer his pain medication incorrectly. “It’s the running joke in the NFL that the injury rate is 100%,” Smith told . “It is going to happen to all of us and it’s a huge part of any recovery process, having to deal with the pain. “It affects how you engage with the world in every way, right? Like it’s how you go to sleep at night and how you get out of bed in the morning, how you engage with your loved ones, but certainly how you take on your recovery and your rehab.” Smith talks about the unimaginable pain he was in at times but said he was initially hesitant to have open conversations about pain medication due to a perceived taboo around the issue. It’s widely reported how have and continue to struggle with painkiller addiction and Smith said he was aware of teammates suffering from this during his career. The problem of addiction continues into retirement, with former stars accostumed to relying on medication to numb the pain during their playing careers. Smith said that pain management was somewhat of an afterthought during his own recovery process but he’s been happy to see how professional sports is now taking the issue seriously. The National Football League Players Association (NFLPA), for example, now has a on its website which outlines the possible benefits and drawbacks of certain types of pain management. Having hung up his cleats, the 41-year-old Smith now wants to use his platform to help continue the conversation about pain medication, an issue that filters out of sport and into wider society. For example, an estimated 8.9 million Americans aged 12 and older misused opioids in 2023 as experts warn of an . “I think we’ve all heard the horror stories or know someone first hand – I know I do – that’s dealt with painkiller addiction and opiates and some of these side effects from the options that have been available in the past, and they scare you to death,” Smith said. “I went home from the hospital with rescue medication, and my wife and I were terrified. I felt guilty when I was in pain, asking for release because I was scared. And again, it just doesn’t have to be that way anymore. “There are more options out there available. There has been a stigma and it has been taboo to talk about this. These are difficult conversations to have, but it doesn’t need to be that way, and it shouldn’t.” Smith is now fronting a which looks to provide individual plans for people dealing with pain medication. He said he hopes it will give people more power to understand what their bodies need and how they are able to safely get it – especially the swathe of rookies who are heading into the NFL this season. “When I was dealing with pain, options weren’t great,” he said. “I wish I could go back and come up with a plan, you know, a literal pain game plan, it would help me so much. So I want to encourage people to have these conversations, empowering people, whether it’s expected or unexpected dealing with pain, to proactively come up with a personalized pain game plan. “It doesn’t have to be taboo anymore. There are so many options out there.”",

    "content": "Every Saturday night throughout the year, Robert Wirehag – a pastor and former youth player for Swedish club IK Sirius – arranges “night football” in Gottsunda, a suburb of Uppsala, Sweden’s fourth-largest city. Uppsala is traditionally known as a peaceful university town roughly 44 miles from the capital of Stockholm, but there are no college students to be seen in the center of Gottsunda on this night. There are, however, plenty of young boys between the ages 12-17 – all of whom Wirehag says are “potential gang members.” “Why? Because they live in a specific suburb in the outer part of this city,” he tells . “And they are – all of them – at risk of being recruited to the gangs. Some of the boys we are working with are already in gangs. Some of them are on their way to being recruited, and some of them are not yet there.” The suburbs where they hold night football sessions are socioeconomically disadvantaged areas, where people often lack access to well-paid jobs, frequently due to language barriers. This creates a breeding ground for criminal activity, Wirehag explains. “Criminal lifestyles emerge in places where there is no money. This leads to people wandering around with nothing meaningful to do. They are at risk of being drawn into a lifestyle of making quick money in an easy but criminal way. That’s why we run activities on Saturday nights – because that’s when they tend to roam around the most.” One of the participants on the night CNN visits is 18-year-old Abdulraof Alchaieb, known as Abudi to his friends. “Every Saturday night, I’m here. It’s a war on the field,” he tells CNN. The “war,” in fact, seems to start at team selection. Starting out, Wirehag thought the best idea would be for him to pick the teams. Growing up in a Swedish culture, he didn’t like the thought of the boys picking teams themselves, since someone would always be everyone’s last choice. “They then chose to leave, in protest against my team selection,” says Wirehag. “I was given the tip to let the guys decide themselves, and ever since then, it’s been working perfectly.” “Perfectly” is not the term everyone would choose to describe the chaos unfolding, but after 10 minutes of loud arguments, the teams are chosen. Abudi, who also plays on the under-19s for first-division Swedish club Sunnersta AIF Fotboll, is one of the team captains. “If I hadn’t had football, I think I could’ve slipped into crime. When you’re my age, 15, 16 or even 14, older guys can easily play with your head. Like, ask you to go and drop this bag to this person and then already there, you’ve taken a big step. ‘Hold this’ while they are running away, and then you’re standing there with a bag of drugs. “The people you thought were your friends will stab you in the back. There’s not much of a dear friendship when it comes to the street. I know people who haven’t made it out. “You can’t just say you don’t want to continue. Then you’re letting them down, and in worst case, they’re looking for you – and in worst case, you die.” When it comes to gang crime, Wirehag says the start of this year has been tough. January saw a record number of explosions with an average of more than one bombing per day taking place, not counting failed attempts and preparations prevented by the police. Explosives are frequently used in criminal conflicts and extortion. Homemade bombs, smuggled pyrotechnic products, and hand grenades are easy to access. Perpetrators of violent crimes, such as shootings or bombings, drug-related offenses, or fraud, are easily recruited through chat groups and digital platforms, according to Swedish police. “Gang crime is a network problem. It exists everywhere throughout Sweden,” Hanna Paradis, former head of the National special operation “Frigg” - a police initiative created in 2023 to combat rising gang violence – tells CNN Sport. In a report published in 2024, Swedish police estimated that 62,000 people were active in or had connections to criminal networks. “Crime is developing at a rapid pace. Ten years ago, we saw that young people perhaps over time began to commit more serious crimes. Today, that time is considerably shortened and that is because these networks recruit young people by advertising a lifestyle that may not actually be true,” says Paradis. “Gang crime has evolved into a kind of gig economy. Criminals post temporary “jobs” in various apps, and younger individuals, tempted by money or status, may take up these offers. However, young recruits rarely receive any actual payment—even if they don’t get caught”, explains Dennis Martinsson, legal expert in Criminal Law and researcher at the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention. Sweden has one of the highest firearm related death rates in Europe, which is closely linked to criminal backgrounds in socially disadvantaged areas, according to a 2021 study by BRÅ, the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention, of over 20 European countries. “Ten years ago, Sweden was one of the countries in Europe with the lowest firearm related violence, so we have had quite a malign development with respect to that kind of violence in Sweden. No other country in Western Europe has at all the same level of problem which Sweden has, with respect to either firearm-related violence or explosive violence, that we can say with certainty,” explains Ardavan Khoshnood, criminologist and associate professor of Emergency Medicine at Lund University. “It makes my heart bleed, as a Swedish patriot, to see what Sweden has become, with respect to gang violence and gang criminality,” adds Khoshnood, who researches the medical, political and criminological aspects of violent crimes through meeting its victims. What is particularly concerning is the sharp rise in under-15-year-olds suspected of being involved in murder. The Swedish Prosecution Authority has documented a three-fold increase of murder related cases in this age group from 2023 to 2024. “We see that all the leaders in the gangs, they’re using children to commit murders, to detonate explosives,” Diamant Salihu, a journalist and author who has reported on the escalation in gang crime conflicts over the past decade, tells CNN Sport. “In some cases, we have children as young as nine years old that are carrying arms to help the older leaders in the gangs.” Salihu explains that the gang leaders systematically use children to commit serious crime is to avoid strict punishments in the judiciary system, since the maximum sentence for a serious crime committed by a person under 18 is usually four years in closed youth care. Dennis Martinsson, legal expert in Criminal Law and researcher at the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention, explains that a youth between 15-17 can, in rare cases, be sentenced to prison. “For very serious offenses—such as murder—the choice is usually between secure youth detention or prison. However, it is extremely rare for individuals this young to be sentenced to prison.” Children under the age of 15 are not legally accountable in Sweden, meaning they cannot be prosecuted or convicted of any crime. Instead, they may be placed under social services interventions. This has prompted a proposed reform to lower the age of criminal responsibility to 14 for serious offenses. The loopholes in the judiciary system, along with failure in integration, are reasons criminal gangs have gained a foothold in Sweden, Salihu suggests. “In our suburbs, we have experienced social issues, high unemployment, significantly higher child poverty rates, and low school performance—various factors of deprivation. Combined, these have created a perfect storm, where police presence has been lacking in areas with multiple open drug markets. Multiple conflicts emerged simultaneously”, Salihu explains and continues: “We’ve seen a lot of increased deadly shootings, but looking back over the past 10 years, very few of them have been solved. And that makes people in these very violent, affected areas feel that society doesn’t really care about their sons being killed. So we have a system and a society where we see people feel that it’s us and them.” While authorities couldn’t provide Uppsala specific statistics for gang related crime, residents and community leaders told CNN they’ve noted a significant increase in criminal activities among minors that have affected many aspects of their daily lives. “This escalation in violence, particularly in Uppsala and around Stockholm, got the effect that opposing teams simply didn’t dare to come to Uppsala, leading to Sirius having to cancel many youth matches that were to be played here,” Wirehag the pastor says. He knows he’s taking a risk coming to the vulnerable area of Gottsunda every Saturday night. “My kids ask me, ‘Dad, do you really need to go to this place tonight? We know what’s happening there. We are afraid that something will happen to you.’ I always have mixed feelings when I get behind the wheel and drive to the suburbs on a Saturday night.” Yet he rarely misses a Saturday. Through soccer, he is hoping to create a link in society that he feels is missing. This evening, he has a surprise for the boys. He’s also invited local police. “These young men often have a hostile attitude toward the police. Some have fled from a country where they have been badly treated by the police. Some are doing illegal acts and are chased by the police. And of course there are those who are experiencing prejudice from the police, just because they have a background different from Swedish, they have been extra monitored and classified as criminals. These boys have no trust in the police whatsoever. We want to give the police the opportunity to slowly but surely build a relationship and trust with these young men.” Despite Wirehag’s attempt to give the police officers in attendance this night a big welcome applause, the boys’ response is lukewarm, to say the least. But some are eager to find out whatever they can. “My friend is 15 and got arrested. What happens when you get taken to the (police) station?” a boy – himself 15 years old – asks community police officer Carina Neumann, who patiently answers all questions, taking him through the scenario of a minor being caught with drugs on them, before he politely thanks her for the conversation and joins the others on the pitch. “We have maintained a strong police presence in Gottsunda. There’s no denying that many conflicts have taken place here. There have been numerous shootings and bombings, and tensions still remain,” Neumann tells CNN. “Quite a few network criminals are currently behind bars, but the recruitment of young people continues. The situation has worsened significantly – violence has become more brutal, and people are being shot over smaller disputes,” she continues. The project in Gottsunda is part of Sirius’ social initiative “Football without borders.” Aside from the Saturday night matches, the club arranges for the boys to watch pro games, both in Uppsala and other cities, and meet some of the elite-level players. One of those is Sweden’s U21 national team player Joakim Persson. “Gottsunda Night Football is for players and guys that have grown up in a place that’s maybe not the best place in Sweden,” Persson tells CNN Sport. “Night football really helps these young people by disrupting chaos they could otherwise create in society. There’s a lot of talk about respect here. It’s very important and I notice that it’s needed.” In Uppsala’s Pentecostal Church, a partner in the night football initiative, before the boys rush up to him for autographs, Persson talks to them about his life as a professional soccer player. “My best tip is to never give up. There will be setbacks in everything you do,” he says to the attentive crowd. “If you want to succeed at something, you have to keep on going, and not let the circumstances make you give up.” Abudi has recently been selected for the Syrian under-20 national team and been invited to next year’s senior national team selection. “The night football has done its part,” he says. “It’s kept me away from everything one should stay away from. And it’s helped a lot of young people aside from myself. I think it should become a bigger deal in Sweden, that should be implemented in every city and municipality.” When CNN meets Wirehag for the second time, he is on a different soccer pitch. The pastor explains the short move – just over 400 yards away from the previous sports hall – which places us outside the district of Gottsunda. “I don’t feel safe there. Not the boys either. So we moved to this area.” Wirehag explains that many of the gang leaders, who sometimes show up at the night soccer sessions and try to use them as recruiting grounds, have enemies outside of their territory and don’t roam outside of the relative safety of Gottsunda, where they mostly operate. That’s why the mere 400 yards or so make a huge difference. “We’ve seen good developments and bad developments. There are still a lot of explosions. There are still a lot of shootings. Some of the boys, they’re not with us today because they left the city or they have been recruited, of course, to different gangs. “But most of the boys, they’re still joining us every Saturday night. We need to show them that there is so much more in this society to live for, (things) worth fighting for. We cannot help everyone and prevent them from being recruited to gangs. But we can help someone, and that’s worth everything if it’s just for one single boy. “If I look back 10 years from now and see that we just saved one boy, it will be worth everything.”",

    "content": "Ibragim Ibragimov’s latest victory over Kenny Mokhonoana kept alive his unbeaten start to professional MMA fighting and his status as one of the most exciting prospects in the sport. But in the hours after the win, the 20-year-old was quick to praise all the help he received in his preparations. Ibragimov of his training staff in Dubai, a group which included two of the greatest MMA fighters ever in Khabib Nurmagomedov and Islam Makhachev. Perhaps it is no surprise that Ibragimov has had such success – he is 9-0 in his blossoming career with his sights set on the top – when he has such legends in his corner. Ibragimov is the latest in the production line of mixed martial arts talent to come out of Dagestan, Russia, with Nurmagomedov and Makhachev acting as figureheads and role models for the new generation. For a region with a population of just over three million – smaller than Los Angeles – it has become renowned for churning out top-level fighting talent, famous for their wrestling abilities and never-say-die attitude. Ibragimov – who fights in the Professional Fighters League (PFL) – is part of the most recent generation of Dagestani fighters who are taking over the sport, and he says that for he and compatriots, fighting is a way of life, not just a profession. “In Dagestan, guys really want to be fighters. In the whole of Europe, there’s not many guys who really want to be fighters,” Ibragimov told . “They just pretended like they are fighters. They want to be like fighters. They want to be like someone. “But in Dagestan, there’s so many guys that really want to be fighters. Not all (European fighters). I’m not speaking for all of them, but I’d say like 30% or 50% of the guys, they don’t really want to be there. They just go in there for a hype and stuff like that, for Instagram.” While fighting might be a walk of life for some, it’s more than that for many Dagestanis. Michael Lyubimov, a famed MMA coach who has worked with many Dagestani fighters including Nurmagomedov, explained that when he often first encounters athletes from the Russian republic upon their arrival in the US, they are already vastly experienced. Lyubimov – who is general manager of the Jackson Wink MMA Academy in New Mexico, renowned for its production of MMA talent – says that many young Russians take up fighting out of “despair from a young age.” “Back where they come from, there’s absolutely nothing. A lot of these guys that come here, I mean, they fought since they’re like six years of age,” Lyubimov – who was born in Moscow before moving to the US as a youngster – told CNN. “By the time they get to the UFC or obtaining these big promotions or come to America, they have over 200 fights and stuff.” He added: “There’s no other option. There are cauliflower ears everywhere. It’s just who they are. It’s in the culture, engraved in them.” Lyubimov also highlights the faith of the fighters from the region as a reason for their success, with many of them practicing Muslims. That means they often don’t drink or party and choose instead to focus on their craft. The combination of those factors breeds a relentlessness in Dagestani fighters, according to Lyubimov. He recounts an athlete once telling him that he “will die in there before anything happens.” Many fighters from the region will put their bodies through significant hardship to sign with big-money promotions, often waiting until they’ve inked deals before undergoing the necessary treatment to heal their ailments. Lyubimov highlights to CNN Sports the journey of Ismail Israilov, from neighboring Chechnya, who recently won a fight after dislocating his shoulder in the first round. Before coming to the US, Israilov had been in a truck accident in which he almost lost his hand and, at the age of 24, has over 200 street fights to his name. When Lyubimov asked Israilov what his upbringing was like back in Russia, the Chechen detailed how he came to have the resilience he now displays in the octagon. “‘My whole life was like, you have a piece of bread in your backpack, and you drive for like an hour and a half to wrestling practice, and sometimes you can’t make it because it’s so far away or whatever, so we’d just fight on the street and practice on the pavement,’” Lyubimov recounts Israilov saying. “‘We live in the middle of nowhere in the mountains. You look one way and there’s nothing there, you look the other way and there’s nothing there. All we have left is to fight.’” During his time as part of Nurmagomedov’s coaching team, Lyubimov spent plenty of hours in the gym with the former UFC great, in both the US and his native Dagestan. Compared to the current commercial gyms he works in now, the centers in Dagestan are vastly different environments with their hyper-focus on discipline, says Lyubimov. “In Dagestan, gyms are government funded or recreational where people can come in. A lot of it is somewhat free, to a certain extent, until, of course, they make it to the big level where they start paying coaches and they’re like at a higher level, professional level,” he said. “But at the beginning level, most of it is free. That’s why if you see Khabib when he walks into the room, or when Abdulmanap (Nurmagomedov’s father) would walk in into the room, all the fighters get up, they line up, they bow down, they’re quiet, they don’t talk, they’re always on time, they don’t talk back to elders, they have absolute major respect. “If you show disrespect to an elderly person or coach or whoever, your peers will put you in place and you can literally get slapped like by a coach and you will be quiet about it and you stand there and take the criticism and them yelling at you if you’re being a dumbass.” That rugged upbringing builds character and toughness. For Lyubimov, this sets the perfect platform from which to build a career. When Lyubimov starts working with Dagestani fighters, it is often a case of refining their skills rather than adding more to their repertoire. “Obviously America is Mecca for making the name for yourself, right?” he explains. “The lights are much brighter when they hit the American promotions. So, it’s just about teaching the composure, keeping emotions under check, and refining the skills. “It’s teaching them how to adapt and how to just refine their skills in general, just making better fighters, understand the game better, understand the rules better, understand what to expect better, get them to deal with medicals, with fight preparations, with weight cutting. The diet, the weight cuts, everything because they do it one way over there. They come here, then they have to kind of relearn, or learn new things.” The golden example of having to adjust to the American system was Nurmagomedov, who arrived in the US as a little-known prospect and blossomed into the biggest name in the sport. His rise to prominence in the UFC was the jumping-off point for Dagestani dominance across the Western MMA scene. Between his grappling skills, undefeated record and his customary wearing of Dagestan’s traditional headpiece in the ring, Nurmagomedov became the hottest topic in the UFC despite not getting involved in the war of words which often previews fights or helps build rivalries between competitors. His popularity grew to a previously unseen level through his rivalry with , and then he retired a few years later. Lyubimov, who helped train Nurmagomedov during his heyday, said that the fighter understood that he needed to engage in sparring matches to continue to build his profile. Since retiring in 2020, Nurmagomedov has transitioned into a mentor for the next generation of Dagestani fighters. He has had a hands-on effect on the burgeoning career of Makhachev, who is the No. 1 ranked pound-for-pound fighter at the moment and the current UFC lightweight world champion. Elsewhere in the UFC, another Dagestani – Magomed Ankalaev – became UFC light heavyweight champion in March, while there are other world champions in MMA competitions around the world from the Russian region. Before his most recent fight in January, Ibragimov trained with Nurmagomedov and Makhachev in Dubai and says the experience in the gym with two of MMA’s luminaries and his Dagestani “brothers” was formative for his burgeoning career. “When you train in Khabib’s gym, and then, especially when he’s in there controlling you, there’s no limits,” he told CNN Sports. “It’s like sometimes he doesn’t even set the timer for training. And then we just train non-stop. We just roll nonstop, until he says stop.” Ibragimov explained that a young Dagestani’s MMA journey is made that much easier because the previous generation has already walked that path and is around to give advice where needed. “They already showed us the road that we have to follow,” he said. Ibragimov – who moved to Manchester, England, as a youngster and has siblings who are part of the Manchester United academy – has a long journey ahead of him in his MMA career. But in Nurmagomedov, Makhachev and other Dagestani fighters, he’s got the perfect role models showing him the way to the top.",

    "title": "\n      American teenager Maya Merhige withstood thousands of jellyfish stings during a 14-hour swim across the Cook Strait\n    ",

    "content": "Maya Merhige eventually stopped counting her jellyfish stings, such was the frequency with which they were getting scorched against her skin. At this point, Merhige was already several hours into her 27-mile swim across the in New Zealand and had slowly become immune to the small, burning sensations that covered her body. By the end, even her face – her nose, ears and lips – had been peppered with them. “Constantly, like 25 times a minute – over and over,” is how often the 17-year-old Californian estimates that she was being stung. That equates roughly to once every third stroke – an aggressive form of exposure therapy for someone who claims to be terrified of jellyfish. “Even when I was getting in the water, I was already like: ‘I’m so scared. I don’t want to see jellyfish,’” adds Merhige. “So the entire time I was just fighting myself mentally to kind of get over that fear.” Confronting her greatest fears is something that Merhige has done time and again while swimming in some of the world’s most challenging and unforgiving waters. Crossing the Cook Strait, which separates New Zealand’s North and South Islands, last month was another step towards her goal of becoming the youngest person to complete the Oceans Seven – a series of brutal open water swims around the globe. Merhige has now successfully traversed the Cook Strait, the Moloka’i Channel in Hawaii, the Catalina Channel off the coast of Los Angeles, and the English Channel between England and France – all before graduating from high school. Still on her to-do list are the North Channel between Ireland and Scotland, the Strait of Gibraltar between Spain and Morocco, and the Tsugaru Strait in Japan. “I’m hoping to be the youngest, which means that I have to do them by January of 2028,” Merhige says. “I am hoping to finish them all. I’m really excited for the ones I have left.” In line with Marathon Swimmers Federation guidelines, only swimsuits – not wetsuits – can be used by those undertaking solo, unassisted marathon swims in open water. Merhige is guided by a support boat and pauses to receive a feed from her crew every half an hour. The Cook Strait crossing, she says, was her hardest swim to date – which became clear the following day when she struggled to lift her arms above shoulder height. The physical toll of taking stroke after stroke for more than half a day was compounded by choppy seas and strong currents, meaning Merhige swam 27 miles instead of 13.7 and was in the water for more than 14 hours instead of the planned seven. But it was her mental resolve that was tested most of all, especially when the large wind turbines marking the end of the swim never appeared to be getting any closer. The best solution, Merhige thought, was to stop obsessing over the distance and just keep swimming. It’s one of the reasons she prefers tackling her marathon swims at nighttime, unable to fret about how far she has to go or what sea creatures might be lurking in the ocean below. “If I can’t see them, I really just tell myself: out of sight, out of mind,” says Merhige – referring, of course, to those much-feared jellyfish. “They’re not there if you can’t see them, so I just pretend it’s not happening, which does help me shut my mind off a little bit.” Another perk to crossing the Cook Strait at night – which Merhige did for almost the entirety of the swim – was catching a glimpse of shooting stars and avoiding the heat of New Zealand’s punishing midday sun. And no sun exposure means no risk of sunburn. That’s useful, Merhige points out, if you have your high school prom in a few days’ time and want to avoid arriving with a swimming cap tan across your forehead. As obstacles go, a poorly-timed tan line is a relatively minor one when it comes to swimming in some of the world’s most dangerous waters. When swimming the length of Lake Tahoe in 2022, Merhige struggled so much that she started to get hallucinations – “I thought that I had been kidnapped for part of it, thought I was swimming with human-sized stuffed animals,” she says – and had to negotiate sharks, seals, whales and dolphins during her Moloka’i Channel crossing the following year. But for all the many challenges she encounters during her swims, Merhige still insists that she is happier in the water than anywhere else. It is, she explains, a “safe place” in which she sees herself as a visitor to an environment which isn’t, and will never be, entirely hers. “It’s become this great relationship,” says Merhige. “I love being in the water so much, and I’m definitely loving it more and more; I have much more respect for the ocean and for the water than I did when I started swimming. “I’ve done so much mental gymnastics in the water that I can adapt myself to deal with whatever situation occurs. Even if I’m scared, I know I can get through that fear. That’s what keeps me safe, and that’s what makes me feel safe.” Merhige has now completed 10 marathon swims, which by definition measure at least 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) in length. With nonprofit , she has raised more than $130,000 for pediatric cancer research, a cause motivated by some of her close family friends who have been affected by the disease. The thought of those living with cancer is what motivates Merhige during some of her darkest, most grueling hours in the water. “There are kids in the hospital, literally right now, who are going through chemotherapy and going through radiation, and if they can get through that, then I can keep swimming, and it’s nothing,” she says. “I’m just telling myself that over and over and thinking: ‘This is bigger than me. There are people cheering me on, and there are people going through cancer that I’m doing this for’ … I know that this is making a bigger impact outside of just me, and that’s really important.” Merhige, too, has faced her own recent health challenges. In March 2023, she ruptured a benign tumor on her pancreas during a skiing crash, causing intense pain and requiring surgery. She was back in the water two weeks after the surgery, and then last year, two months after she was in and out of hospital for further treatment, Merhige completed her crossing of the English Channel. More surgery is on the horizon this summer, meaning another Oceans Seven swim isn’t on the cards this year. That will have to wait until 2026, when Merhige hopes to complete two, maybe three, of the remaining swims during her first year at college. She’s currently on a pre-med track and hopes to be at a school on the East Coast – the opposite side of the country to her hometown of Berkeley. “I don’t think any of my top schools are remotely near water,” says Merhige, “but I’m going to find lakes, I’m going to find rivers. I’m going to make it work.” The water, Merhige adds, is the place where she feels “the most myself,” and she has no intentions to wave goodbye to that part of her identity while at college. But one bonus of being on the East Coast? The jellyfish will be very, very far away.",

    "content": "fans have spent the last few months in something akin to open rebellion against the team’s front office after franchise icon Luka Dončić was traded to the . On Monday, that all might have just become incredibly turbulent water under the bridge. The Mavs won the NBA lottery, getting the first pick in the draft and the chance to replace Dončić with Duke phenom Cooper Flagg. Going into the night with just a 1.8% shot of getting the No. 1 pick, the Mavericks might have just lucked into one of the all-time great draft shocks in sports history. Consider this: , the Mavericks went 14-21, lost Anthony Davis – the main player they received in return for Dončić – for weeks due to injury in his first game with the team, lost talisman Kyrie Irving to a season-ending ACL injury and watched a slew of other players go down hurt. Davis returned as the Mavs tried to win a spot in the NBA playoffs through the play-in round but ultimately fell short. During that entire time, the fans demanded the dismissal of general manager Nico Harrison, the architect of the deal to send Dončić to the City of Angels, and pundits declared that the Mavericks had just made a potentially franchise killing move. Dončić is just 26 years old, led the team to the NBA Finals a season earlier, had been named All-NBA each year he had been in the league and was entering his prime. All reporting around the deal indicated that Dončić never planned to leave Dallas, and his emotional return to Texas indicated that the pain of the surprise move still lingers with him. All in all, it was shaping up to be a disaster of historic proportions. How far would the franchise sink after placing its hopes on the shoulders of an aging core of players who are frequently injured and watching the anticipated cornerstone of the franchise link up with LeBron James and the Lakers? Guess we’ll never know. The impending arrival of Flagg – the widely-anticipated top pick in the draft unless Dallas and Harrison decide to shock the basketball world once again – means the Mavericks will replace Dončić with one of the game’s brightest young talents. At Duke, Flagg sometimes looked like he was playing a different game than the opposition. There were few things he couldn’t do, even though he was among the youngest players in the country; he didn’t turn 18 until the season had already started. He averaged 19.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.4 blocks and 1.2 steals in 37 games for the Blue Devils, who lost in the men’s Final Four to the University of Houston in the final minutes. His trophy case from his one year in the college game is staggering. He won the Naismith Award as college basketball’s top player and won national player of the year by five of the six organizations that hand out the honor. He was the ACC player of the year, the ACC’s rookie of the year, a consensus first-team all-American and was the East Region Outstanding Player as the Blue Devils steam rolled their way to the Final Four. “It’s been a rough year as you all know,” Rolando Blackman, Mavericks ambassador and four-time NBA All-Star, said in an ESPN interview after the lottery. “We’ll get a chance to move our franchise forward … It’s really, really a great honor, and it’s an important piece of the puzzle because we want to hoop down in Dallas.” Blackman said that Flagg “can hoop, he can play,” adding, “There’s a lot of great players in that draft class … We will see how the guys get together and being able to make our team better which is exactly what we want to do.” An outstanding two-way player, Flagg will hope to fulfill Harrison’s oft-repeated pledge in the wake of the Dončić trade: that defense wins championships. Dončić’s relative lack of defensive prowess was the main reason that Harrison justified the trade publicly, although reports after the deal indicated there were questions about his fitness, commitment and disagreements with team personnel that helped drive a wedge between the Slovenian star and the Mavs. Dončić was absolutely beloved by the Mavericks fanbase – “He was ours,” Dallas fan John Tarrant told earlier this year. It’s hard to imagine that Flagg will completely replace the 6-foot-6-inch, 230-pound, Dončić-shaped gap in the hearts of Mavs fans – at least right away. But his anticipated arrival in the Metroplex is likely to begin to quell one of the most tumultuous periods for any team in recent memory. It’s enough to give a whole city a collective case of whiplash. And for Harrison – the source of the city’s ire, the man who bears responsibility for the Dončić trade and became one of the most ridiculed executives in sports – it suddenly looks like an insane gamble might have paid off. If the Mavericks find themselves making a deep playoff run in a year or two, the embattled GM will likely be telling anyone within earshot: “I told you so!” Whether he’d deserve to do so is a fair question. He and his team entered Monday with a 1.8% chance of getting the top pick and got a lucky bounce which was so unlikely that online conspiracy theories were immediately created to explain it. There’s no evidence of a conspiracy. Instead, it’s just cemented something we already knew: the Dallas Mavericks’ 2025 is going down as one of the most unlikely rollercoaster rides in sports history. Surely, Harrison is going to make the easy choice and take Flagg with the top pick. But after the last few months, it’d be hard to blame any Mavs fans for being on the edge of their seats until the teenage star’s name is called by commissioner Adam Silver in Brooklyn next month.",

    "content": "Between rising sea levels from the , a history of nuclear testing causing radioactive pollution and population displacement, the Marshall Islands face numerous threats. Now, the country – made up of 29 atolls and five main islands in the North Pacific – is shining a light on the struggles it faces by turning to an unlikely source: . The Marshall Islands are seeking to become the last of the 193 United Nations member states to have a recognized international 11-a-side soccer team, with the aim of becoming a member of – world soccer’s governing body – by 2030. To help the cause, the nation’s soccer governing body has organized a four-team tournament taking place this summer in Springdale, Arkansas, home to the largest Marshallese community outside of the islands. But perhaps more important than the sporting benefits of the endeavor is the opportunity to raise awareness of the environmental battle the country faces as a result of climate change. To that end, the three British men behind the initiative – Matt Webb, Lloyd Owers and Justin Walley – have also created a new team kit. Designed with the colors of the Marshall Islands flag and emblazoned with images of the islands’ flora and fauna, the number 1.5 takes pride of place in the center of the “No-Home” shirt, a reference to the , in which countries agreed to make efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. A quote from Marshallese poet Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner is also etched onto the shirt: “We deserve to thrive.” The message and the unique design were enough to make it a popular release. But it got even more attention when, with each photo post on social media of the new kit, parts of the shirt had disappeared; first a bit of a sleeve, next some from the midriff and then from the collar. The gradual loss of parts of the kit was used as a stark reminder of the creeping danger that rising sea levels present to the Marshall Islands. , sea levels in the Marshall Islands have risen by 10 centimeters (almost 3.94 inches) over the last 30 years and could rise by 19 centimeters (roughly 7.48 inches) over the next 30 years, leading to an increase in flooding with “worsening severity.” If no measures are taken, the islands are likely to face more than 100 days of flooding yearly by the end of the century. Webb, who works as the head of commercial for the Marshall Islands Soccer Federation, explains that while developing the soccer side was the main priority when they began their work, they are in the “fortunate position” to be able to bring attention to an issue that perhaps would fall by the wayside. “There is an obligation to talk about aspects such as climate change, nuclear legacy. We have this kind of duty of care to mention it at least. And we decided to use the shirt as a way to it,” Webb told . “It’s a celebration of a rich culture of the Marshall Islands and, potentially, what could be lost if action isn’t taken. We appreciate that climate change can be polarizing to some people and it’s maybe not something they want to focus on in sport. But for us, it would be amiss if we didn’t kind of reference it at all. And using sport as well, we’ve got such a huge platform where other outlets might not necessarily be able to touch upon that.” The Marshall Islands are home to around 39,000 people and are on the opposite side of the world to the United Kingdom, where Webb and Owers live. But they stumbled across the country’s sporting plight . The Marshall Islands Soccer Federation was founded in 2020 by President Shem Livai because his son was an avid soccer fan, but there was no structure for kids to play. Webb immediately wanted to be involved. Webb and Owers both have experience in the Beautiful Game prior to this endeavor. Webb’s day job is in marketing but he has previously been involved in soccer administration and founding clubs, while Owers has previously worked as a coach and helped in forming coaching programs for teams in the UK and abroad. Webb recalls finding Livai on social media and eventually his email before “peppering” him with messages offering his services as a volunteer until Livai, as the Brit recounts, “relented.” Owers was introduced by a mutual connection after which he was appointed technical director and the pair set about revamping the federation. Webb admits that they faced some skepticism from locals in the early months – “‘What are you doing? You’re saying you’re Marshall Islands Soccer Federation, but you’re doing this from the UK,’” he remembers being asked – but have since developed relationships and connections to establish their credibility as keen volunteers. While soccer is known as the global game, that is not the case on the Marshall Islands. Given its longstanding connections to the US – the republic is home to the US Army Garrison Kwajalein, which helps in ballistic missile testing and tracking – basketball and volleyball are the most popular sports there. While many of the youngsters on the island may be fans of soccer, Webb explains, the lack of accessibility to adequate facilities and coaching means few play it regularly. Webb and Owers set about using futsal – a scaled-down version of regular soccer played with five players on each team and on smaller pitches – to increase playing time, using the abundance of basketball courts as venues. But, due to the geographic make-up of the islands, space is at a premium when it comes to full-size 11-a-side pitches, which FIFA have the dimensions of 105 meters (almost 344.5 feet) x 68 meters (almost 223.1 feet). “It’s a very low-lying island nation, which is built on top of essentially a coral reef. And when you’re there, you can kind of really feel how close you are and how much your islands are related to the oceans,” Webb explains. “You’ve got oceans on one side, and it’s basically a circular lagoon on the inside as well. So there’s points on your island where it’s just one road separating the ocean to the lagoon. You feel really exposed at times.” The country did build a stadium for the Micronesian Games last summer, which gives the islands a useable pitch, but it still has no goals even now. They have focused on acquiring equipment, creating opportunities to play and providing coaches for the Marshallese people to get a taste of what the Beautiful Game can bring. While they are hoping that this next generation of soccer-mad youngsters will provide the bedrock for a blossoming Marshall Islands national team, their current crop of players is made up of young adults and expatriates from surrounding islands, such as Solomon Islands, Fiji and Kiribati. With the help of on-island coaches, the British volunteers were able to build a soccer system across the islands. They have seen buy-in across the generations as their reputations have grown. On top of the sporting benefits have been the human impact, which Webb describes as arguably the more “rewarding” part of what they’re doing. On Owers’ most recent trip to the Marshall Islands, he led a group from the island of Majuro – the country’s capital – to the island of Kwajalein. He was told by one of his players: “This is the best weekend of my life.” Webb explains: “We can take it for granted, the ability to move freely between places, but for some of these lads, it’s the first time off island or traveling by plane and seeing new things and meeting new people. So there’s that kind of personal impact you’re having on people’s lives.” Both Webb and Owers are unequivocal in their aim of having the Marshall Islands being involved in the qualification process for a FIFA World Cup. But to do that, there are certain criteria they must meet to be able to join a regional confederation. The first step on that journey is the four-team tournament in August in Arkansas, their first 11-a-side matches against other international teams. The “Outrigger Cup” will see the Marshall Islands face the US Virgin Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and Guam, all three of which are FIFA member nations. They have started a for the tournament, which they see as an opportunity to bring Marshallese people together. “We want to be in a position to allow every Marshallese person the opportunity to be a part of our project regardless of where they are in the world,” Owers said. “Uniting everyone in a different place is another opportunity for us to do that. “I think, as a byproduct of it, hopefully this then propels the project into something where we’re in front of those confederations that we’ve applied for. They’ve got more awareness of what we’re doing, and seeing the journey and the development of where we were, where we’ve gone, and then where we want to be, and hopefully using this as a bit of a platform to push on from that.” Webb acknowledges the importance of recognizing the nuclear legacy of the Marshall Islands; the US government conducted 67 nuclear tests there between 1946 and 1958 which “left communities displaced and contributed to radioactive land and sea pollution,” . He talks about how much the islanders value community, which too is under threat, as more families emigrate to the US to avoid the impacts of climate change. But Webb believes soccer can help bring the Marshallese together. “We want to unite people through a medium of sport, and hopefully raise awareness to those issues that people face on daily basis. If we can have any small part in helping that, then we will.”",

    "title": "\n      ‘It changed me’: Big wave surfer Garrett McNamara on the wipeout that altered his perspective\n    ",

    "content": "As a professional big wave surfer, charging down mountains of water that reach the size of an apartment block, Garrett McNamara doesn’t scare easily. Perhaps best known for taking on huge walls of water in his television docuseries, “100 Foot Wave,” the 57-year-old Hawaiian earned himself a world record in 2011 – which has – for surfing the biggest wave in the world, a 78-foot (23.8 meters) monster in . But despite his fearlessness and aptitude for risk, the surfer isn’t immune to the peaks and troughs of life. In 2016, the veteran surfer suffered a wipeout at Mavericks, a famous big wave surf break off the coast south of San Francisco, shattering his shoulder into “10 pieces.” What followed was months of physical pain and “the most challenging six months ever in my life,” he said to . “It was a very dark, dark time of our life, our relationship and working through that,” his wife Nicole told CNN, explaining that the accident “began a very long journey of depression.” “At that time, Garrett I feel was really actually going and chasing these waves for the wrong reason … (for) most of our relationship, he was doing it for the right reasons,” she added. “He was trying to prove himself to the wrong people for the wrong reasons, and it was one of the first times I didn’t actually travel with him.” While she was at home and caring for their young son in 2016, she received a brief message informing her that her husband had been injured. The experience of the injury, McNamara told CNN, “totally changed me,” and almost 10 years later, he said his perspective on life has transformed. “I’ve been really doing well, better than I’ve ever done on land, and I have released the monkey. The monkey is not on my back. I don’t have to ride every swell everywhere in the world,” he said. “I’m really looking at being more present, being with the family, doing things with purpose and intention, and taking my time, slowing down – all things that aren’t normal for me.” The life of a big wave surfer is one that few could imagine, involving copious amounts of travel, change and risk, and McNamara said, for the most part: “We fly by the seat of our pants and I just go and do whatever this amazing woman shares with me.” Nicole added, “We’re polar opposites, but I think that’s what makes it work.” “I’m the grounding force that he doesn’t have, and he’s this excitement and adventure and freedom that I definitely don’t have but crave it,” she explained. Now entering its third season, “100 Foot Wave” explores the challenges of the sport for a crew of surfers – and their families – as they continue to push boundaries. This involves dealing with the death of a tow surfer, brain injury and the impacts of these tragedies on a community. Away from filming, in their day to day life, the couple still navigates regular situations like raising their children, who have inherited their parents’ love for the ocean, though McNamara explained to CNN, “I’m not real excited for anybody to follow in my footsteps. I am an open book when it comes to all the challenges I faced.” “If (my son) Barrel wants to follow in my footsteps, I will just make sure he trains harder than anybody and is ready for what he’s getting himself into,” the veteran surfer added. As for what’s next in life, if and when “100 Foot Wave” ends, McNamara says he will always have an affinity with the ocean. “I won’t ride horses, I won’t jump out of airplanes … I’m very comfortable in the ocean and I’ve always focused on riding big waves. “I feel like I’ll be riding big waves ‘til the end, but maybe vicariously through people that I’m helping and mentoring and driving the jet ski – I’ll be able to drive the jet ski forever.”",

It was an extraordinary , made even more remarkable when the celebrations afterwards revealed that the scorer – Preben Elkjær Larsen – had lost his shoe in the process. Elkjær Larsen’s celebrations included pointing to his now shoeless goalscoring foot and his teammates joining him in expressing their incredulity of the moment. “ ” or “the goal without a shoe” is a fitting microcosm of the miraculous 1984-85 season from Hellas Verona, in which the provincial team from the north of Italy stunned the historic heavyweights of Serie A to win the Italian title. The “ ” (determination) Elkjær Larsen showed to overcome the loss of the shoe personified the spirit shown by the over the course of a miraculous season, sealing the club’s one and only Scudetto. Forty years on from the title and the team’s squad is still celebrated as heroes in the city; before Verona’s home game the day before the May 12 anniversary against Lecce, a group of the players returned to the stadium for a special ceremony to commemorate their achievement. The club told CNN Sports that it organized a five-day exhibition at its Bentegodi stadium which included photos, videos and historical memorabilia from that year. It said that the exhibition sold out in a few days, attracting more than 3,000 people while fans turned up an hour early for the 40-year celebrations ahead of the game against Lecce to serenade their returning heroes. Author Richard Hough, who has lived in Verona for 14 years, recounts the tale of that magical season in , a celebration of the impossible and a “really positive story to tell about the football club.” It’s a story involving planning, perseverance and a fair share of colorful characters, and one which has later been overshadowed for some by the social, economic and political changes Verona – located between Milan and Venice – as a city has gone through. But one thing is for certain: the 1984-85 Hellas Verona season will live long in the memory of those involved. Soccer in Italy in the 1980s was the place-to-be for world stars. The had won the World Cup in 1982 – including one of the greatest games in soccer history when the Italians beat Brazil 3-2 in the second-round group stage – and many of the biggest names from across the world plied their trade in the country at the domestic level. Argentina superstar in 1984, three-time Ballon d’Or winner Michel Platini was at Juventus, Germany’s Karl-Heinz Rummenigge was at and Brazil stars Sócrates and Zico were at Fiorentina and Udinese, respectively. Comparatively, Hellas Verona was living in a vastly different realm. The team began the 1980s in Italy’s second tier, Serie B, before it began its “project” of becoming a stable Serie A club, Hough explains. They first did so by appointing the “relatively unknown manager” Osvaldo Bagnoli in 1981 which paid immediate dividends, earning them promotion soon after and finishing fourth in their first season back in the top-flight. Bagnoli built his team with a collection of cast-offs from bigger clubs, players who had faltered on grander stages and had something to prove. Goalkeeper Claudio Garella, club captain Roberto Tricella, winger Pierino “Pietro” Fanna and diminutive attacker Giuseppe Galderisi all had been released from top-level clubs because of perceived flaws. Bagnoli molded these unheralded players into the formidable spine of a team and – thanks to the club’s forward-thinking board and an injection of money through a sponsorship deal with Canon – Verona was able to add a sprinkling of European talent to the Italian core. The Verona board were present in France for Euro 1984 and on their scouting mission, spent specific time targeting two potential additions: West Germany’s Hans-Peter Briegel and Denmark’s Elkjær Larsen. Briegel, a powerful left-back, was a vital part of West Germany’s national set up while Elkjær Larsen, a hulking striker, was part of the Danish team which lost in the semifinals of Euro 1984. They were added to Verona’s squad before the 1984-85 season – a time when Italian clubs were only permitted two foreign signings – and their presence was noticeable from the first training session. “When they arrived, the Italian players were shocked by what they saw,” Hough told . “Today, we’re accustomed to these players who are all physically athletes. “But back in the early 1980s in Italy, they weren’t really of that stature. They saw Briegel and they just saw this absolute monster. And Elkjær Larsen was impressive physically as well. He was tall and physically very strong. The Italians were all a bit like: ‘Wow, look at these guys.’” The season began perfectly for the , winning 3-1 at home against Napoli – in Maradona’s debut – with Briegel scoring the first goal of the season on his debut. And for the remainder of the campaign, the team remained atop the league table, only joined by Inter Milan for a day. “Nobody ever really expected them to win the thing, that was never on the itinerary,” Hough explained. “The objective was really just to establish them as a credible Serie A team.” For a team lacking the star power many of their opponents possessed, it was a remarkable achievement and one which highlighted the togetherness of the squad. Hough explains that Bagnoli ensured his players remained grounded, not allowing them to even use the word “Scudetto” to banish notions of any title-winning aspirations. As for the players themselves, they held meetings between themselves to rally around the idea of winning the league. Hough says there was a meal around Christmas between players and their spouses in which Fanna said: “Guys, this is our season. If we don’t do it now, we never will.” The team’s year was punctuated with moments which encapsulated the spirit with which the squad displayed on their journey, most notably Elkjær Larsen’s shoeless goal against Juventus. “After fifty meters of running, two dribbles against Juventus with (defender Stefano) Pioli – I think he took my shoe off – I was in front of the goal, what was I supposed to do?” Elkjær Larsen remembers of the goal, . “I hit my leg and so I remained barefoot and I kicked. I found a nice place on my foot and I kicked. I showed my teammates that I scored without a shoe. The next day there was a lot of fuss in the newspapers. But can you score without a shoe? Of course, the only thing you need to have is pants.” Hough also highlights the 5-3 win against Udinese, where the team surrendered a three-goal lead only to score twice late on, and a 0-0 draw at AS Roma – where Garella put in an inspired performance to keep Verona in the game – as examples of the team’s fortitude. Verona lost its first game of the season in its 15th match and lost only two the entire campaign. The needed just a point from its penultimate game at Atalanta. A huge convoy of fans made the journey to Bergamo while thousands more listened on large speakers in Verona’s main square, the Piazza Brà. Although Atalanta took the lead, Elkjær Larsen equalized and Verona’s historic title-winning campaign was confirmed. Seemingly, the whole city poured in towards Piazza Brà to celebrate the moment, with Hough saying that in the Arena di Verona’s almost 2,000-year history, it “has never quite seen a party like it.” The party continued when the players arrived and after the team’s final game of the season, where there were parachutists, balloons and music inside the Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi. Bagnoli, now seen as a legendary figure in the city, found time to celebrate the moment in his own special way, ducking away to the laundry room for a sweet tea with the laundry lady. And for the fans at the time, it was a “deeply emotional moment.” “They’ve never seen anything like it. Their local team, the team that they grew up following, the team on the biggest stage against some of the biggest and the best names in world football,” Hough said. “For them, it was just this emotional, exciting party like nothing else they’d ever seen before.” Verona’s title was seen as a victory for the best team in Italy that year against the traditional elite. And while many other teams saw it as a deserving winner, Hough says it was a turning point for Italian soccer. The 1984-85 season was the first and only season in which referees were allocated for games by a random ballot. Typically, referees are assigned by a commission and the system was changed after a betting scandal in the early 1980s. After Verona’s Scudetto, the system reverted back to the old method of allocation. Although Hough doesn’t believe people put Verona’s success down to that one-off system, he acknowledges it’s a major talking point when it comes to discussing their success. Verona’s magical season also comes against the backdrop of a changing social, political and economic scene in Italy, one which can be seen through the lens of the club’s hardcore fans. The who occupy the Bentegodi’s Curva Sud became renowned for their fanatical support during the title-winning season, but in the following years, have been in the headlines for negative reasons, whether it be violence or . A changing landscape inside Italy – between the rise of far-right politics and mass migration – in the 1990s was reflected in Verona’s ultras, Hough explains, describing the 1984-85 season as “the end of an age of innocence” at the club. “You had this miracle achievement, the innocence then ended, times got tough again in Verona for the football team and the change in political and social and economic dynamics,” he said. “Young people at that point were looking for a sense of identity. They were looking for somewhere to express their frustration or these sometimes extreme political opinions and they found that on the Curva.” Hough says that “well-earned” reputation Verona has means it is “quite a vilified club” across Italy now. But for the Scottish author, he believes separating Verona’s standing and that magical 1984-85 season allows one to appreciate the achievements. The players are treated like heroes whenever they return to Verona – Elkjær is called “ ” or mayor and Hough says about Bagnoli: ‘If he was in Napoli, he would be God” – for their success against some of the biggest names in the world. Verona itself describes the members of the team as “heroes.” “Many players still have chants dedicated to them. In addition, all the players from that year recall in interviews how, even today, 40 years later, people in Verona stop them in the street to say hello or ask for a photo,” the club told CNN Sports via email. The sporting comparison Hough makes with that 1984-85 Verona season is Leicester City’s shock Premier League title win in 2015-16, a season which has gone down in sporting lore as success against the odds. But more than just what was achieved on the pitch, it was a sign that “anything was possible.” “Clubs that had the right manager and took the right approach to playing the game could achieve important things and probably for the likes of Sampdoria, for example, who would go on to win the Scudetto, it was a source of inspiration,” Hough said. And according to the club, it is an achievement that is unlikely to ever be matched again. “The reality is that in Serie A, since the three-point system was introduced in the 1994-1995 season, the championship has been won only by Juventus, Inter and Milan, and once by Roma, Lazio and Napoli,” it said. “In modern football, it seems impossible that another provincial team could win the championship again, even though Atalanta, the team from Bergamo, has shown in recent years that it is possible for provincial teams to return to greatness.”",

    "content": "If an 18th birthday is supposed to be a momentous, coming-of-age occasion, then got the memo. In front of a home crowd in Madrid, the then-up-and-coming tennis star braced himself to face one of the game’s great players for the first time. Alcaraz had spent his whole childhood idolizing . To face the legendary Spaniard on his favored clay surface produced a cocktail of emotions: excitement, exhilaration, but also deep-seated terror. “I was so scared,” Alcaraz has since said about that moment. “I couldn’t play. His presence, the atmosphere that you feel – it’s unbelievable.” For Nadal’s camp, those nerves were plain to see. Carlos Moyá, the long-time former coach to the 22-time grand slam singles champion, could sense it from the stands – a young player suddenly overawed and overwhelmed by his opponent. Yet despite the lopsided scoreline – Nadal romped to a 6-1, 6-2 victory on the Madrid clay – Moyá was also impressed by the young Spaniard on the other side of the net. “You could see that he was special,” the former world No. 1 tells . “He had all the shots … drop shots or volleys or running, it was great to watch.” Four years on from that match, Alcaraz’s raw talent has come to fruition. He’s now a four-time grand slam champion and the favorite to defend his French Open title when the tournament gets underway on Sunday – an event that Nadal has dominated for the past two decades. Though seeded second behind Italy’s , who is making a return from a , Alcaraz defeated his rival in the final of the Italian Open last week. Prior to that, he won the Monto-Carlo Masters and reached the final of the Barcelona Open before losing to Holger Rune. When he returns to Roland Garros to face veteran Japanese player Kei Nishikori in the first round, Alcaraz will do so having won 15 of his 16 clay-court matches this season. “He is 22, so he has a bright present and bright future ahead of him, and he has all the tools to keep winning slams,” says Moyá, adding: “You don’t know what can happen in five years, eight, 10, I don’t know, but for sure, he has three, four, five years ahead of him that he can win slams. “I think his game is amazing. And although he can play well everywhere, I think clay is the best surface for him. He has all the shots to do well on clay. And as he proved this last month, winning Monte-Carlo and Rome, he probably is the biggest favorite to win the French Open.” With Alcaraz and Sinner leading the charge in the men’s draw, it feels like this year’s tournament in Paris is truly the start of a new era. Nadal, an unprecedented 14-time champion on these courts, has called time on his career, and instead will be honored by organizers when play begins on Sunday. Moyá, himself a former French Open champion who coached Nadal to eight grand slam titles, will be there to soak up the tributes to the tournament’s favorite son. The chance to acknowledge Nadal’s astonishing French Open record – he lost just four of his 116 matches on the Paris Clay – will be bittersweet, a fond but painful parting. “It’s going to be a strange feeling for me, but we’re going to enjoy it,” says Moyá. “We enjoyed it so much in the past eight years being with Rafa. He was feeling unbeatable and we always have great memories when we’ve been there, and also for me because of what happened in ’98 (defeating fellow Spaniard Àlex Corretja in the final). “It’s going to be a different feeling, and I don’t think I’ll watch too much on TV once I’m home because I feel kind of sad not being there. But I wish all the best to all the competitors that are going to be there.” Indeed, Moyá admits that he hasn’t watched a lot of tennis since Nadal bid goodbye to the sport in November. He’s yet to take up another full-time coaching post, but has been named a captain for the inaugural , a new tour in which 15 not-long-retired players have been drafted into three teams. The tournament gets underway on the Caribbean island of St. Barts next month, while Moyá’s team – which features 2020 US Open champion Dominic Thiem, as well as former top-10 players Diego Schwartzman and Fernando Verdasco – will make a first appearance in New York in July. “During the years I’ve been with Rafa, (he) played against probably all of them,” says Moyá. “That’s going to help me a little bit. And I hope to give my team the right orders. They are good enough to play even without the captain, but I’ll try to help. I’ll try to add my experience, and I’m really looking forward to it.” The Legends Team Cup is a timely reminder that, although an elite athlete’s body may wane with time, the desire to compete at a high level never fades entirely. “This is what we have in our blood – try to win whatever it takes,” Moyá adds. “Sometimes, you miss that competition.” That same competitive desire might be reignited briefly when Moyá and Nadal return to the French Open’s Court Philippe-Chatrier on Sunday, albeit without the forehands and fireworks that typified Nadal’s all-conquering performances on clay. As they soak up the tributes and applause, Alcaraz will kick-off his title defense the following day, the same nervous teenager who was crushed by his idol just over four years ago. With Nadal watching on and Alcaraz now the formidable force on the court, it will be hard to escape the sense that one tennis generation is finally giving way to the next. And if there’s one thing the two men have in common, for Moyá it boils down to mentality. “This never-say-die attitude, they both have it,” he says, “and this killer instinct, they have it.” Nadal built a fortress at the French Open. The time now feels ripe for Alcaraz to forge a legacy of his own.",

    "title": "\n      A wheel of cheese, a steep hill and broken bones: say hello to the world’s most dangerous race\n    ",

    "content": "It’s been described as the world’s most dangerous race, and it’s certainly one of the most ridiculous – a 200-yard dash after a wheel of Double Gloucester cheese. To win, all you have to do is chase it down a grassy hill and cross the finish line before anyone else; however, that’s much easier said than done. The hill is so steep that it could give you vertigo on the start line and there is absolutely no guarantee that you will make it down to the bottom in one piece. “You’ve just got to have a disregard for your own safety,” Chris Anderson explained to . Anderson won his first of his record 23 races in 2005 and broke his ankle in the celebrations, but the excruciating pain and eight weeks in a cast didn’t put him off. The next year he won again, but he doesn’t remember much about his third victory in 2007, when he crossed the finish line unconscious. “That was a bit of a blur,” he noted, recalling that he’d banged his head on the way down. Nobody seems to know for sure how long they’ve been chasing cheese wheels down Cooper’s Hill in the village of Brockworth in southwest England, but it first appeared in written records in 1826. It might have started as a pagan ritual to bless the farmers’ crops, or perhaps they were originally rolling barrels down to test their integrity – a cooper is, after all, a barrel maker. But it’s a tradition that the locals have fought to preserve and it’s one they are intensely proud of. And now, with the advent of the internet age, it’s an event which has become truly international; thousands of people flock to the event on the last bank holiday in May, and winners have hailed from as far afield as New Zealand and Australia, Egypt and the United States. But the ultimate champions are the people who know the hill best: the locals. “I used to go up there camping with my friends,” Anderson said. “We used to get drunk and throw each other down.” The hill is absurdly steep: an initial drop of 60 degrees with an average of 45 degree incline. Looking down from the top, it initially seems like a sheer drop and many runners have changed their minds at the last minute when they realize what they’re in for. “The first 10 meters are, like, near vertical,” Anderson explained to CNN. “You’ve just got to almost dive into it and try to stay on your feet. “As soon as you go, there’s no stopping, you’ve just got the let momentum take over. Just try and keep on your feet as long as possible, and if you fall, get up as quick as you can.” Ideally, Anderson prefers the ground to be soft, but not wet. The drier it is, the better the traction, the harder the terrain, the greater the potential for injuries. In the 2025 edition of the race, Germany’s Tom Kopke won the first men’s race – his second at the event – while 20-year-old Eva won the women’s race, afterwards that she doesn’t even like cheese. Dressed as Superman, Gloucester local Luke Briggs won the second men’s race, New Zealander Byron won the final men’s race and Ariel Denpsey won the women’s uphill race, but revealed she only took part for efficiency reasons. “I did the downhill race and left my phone up here with someone. I thought the uphill race would be the best way back up,” Ariel , also saying that she only decided to participate on the morning of the race. Video footage of any cheese rolling race depicts a scene of utter chaos. Few competitors are able to remain upright for very long, some are anxiously trying to maintain control by sliding on their bottoms, while others have lost all dignity, careening down in various states of distress. Still images captured by photographers at the bottom present a confusing tableau, as if a giant has tipped a box of action figures out onto the hillside, bodies are upside down, or airborne sideways, and limbs are flailing everywhere. Anderson first attended the cheese rolling when he was around 10 years old, and he remembers seeing the mass of humanity flashing past him on the hill. “It was so fun to watch people flying and falling,” he reminisced, adding that it wasn’t all fun and games. “One of the most standout things was someone breaking their leg, his studs got stuck in the ground and the momentum just pushed him forward. He was sat in the middle of the hill with his leg just dangling, it was pretty disgusting!” Serious injuries are practically guaranteed, one year Anderson witnessed three broken ankles, two of which belonged to international runners who missed their flights home because of emergency surgery. Ankle injuries are common – some have witnessed feet out of alignment by 180 degrees – as are concussions; 2023 women’s champion Delaney Irving was knocked out just before the finish line and only learned of her triumph when she was told about it in the medical enclosure. On the Netflix docuseries “We Are the Champions,” women’s record holder and four-time winner Flo Early revealed a protrusion of her right shoulder, a permanent disfigurement, caused by a collar bone that was broken on the hill. It’s therefore no surprise that many runners might need a splash of alcohol in order to run. Anderson said that the races used to start at 6:30 p.m. in the evening, but the start time was moved earlier because too many people were intoxicated. Now, runners in need of some Dutch courage just start drinking earlier. Anderson told CNN Sports he prepares in moderation by drinking a single can of lager on the walk up. “I always saw that if you were drunk and you broke something, there’s not a great deal they can give you for the pain, so I always try to do it as sober as possible,” he said. Signs posted all over the hill make it clear that runners are participating at their own risk, the local enthusiasts who stage the event say they are not official organizers – in case of injury, there is nobody to sue, and the event is uninsured. Nevertheless, the BBC that the Gloucestershire police force advised 86-year-old cheesemaker Diana Smart – who makes the 6.6-pound (three-kilogram) wheel of Double Gloucester cheese used in the race – that she could be held liable because anyone who facilitates the event could be deemed an organizer by default. Anderson told CNN that he never had any intention of breaking the record of 21 cheese wins, which was set in 1991, but once he got to 13, he decided to keep going. In 2011 and 2017, he won three races in a single day and he broke the record with two more wins in 2018. At the age of 37, he’s recovering from a long-term hip injury – and he is “supposed to be retired” – but if his 16-year-old son decides to compete then he could be tempted back onto the hill, partly to make sure he does it right. “I’d be happy for him to run,” he said, “but I’ve told him if you’re not gonna commit, there’s no point in even doing it.” The veteran cheese-chaser knows that there are many ways to be hurt on the hill. “The most dangerous thing is going slow and getting hit from behind. I’d like him to be quick enough to get away from the carnage.” And if he ever decides to run again, he said it won’t be for the cheese: “I actually don’t like it. It’s got quite a strong aftertaste to it.”",

    "content": "won the on Sunday, cutting teammate Oscar Piastri’s lead at the top of the drivers’ championship to three points. “It feels amazing,” Norris told broadcaster Sky Sports after the race. “It’s a long, grueling race, but good fun.” “Amazing weekend, with pole, with today. This is what I did dream of when I was a kid. So I achieved one of my dreams,” he added. The British driver began in pole position having put up a record lap in qualifying, and managed to hold onto his lead with Charles Leclerc lurking despite his tires locking up going into the first corner. It was the closest anyone would come to overtaking Norris, even if a late fightback from the Monégasque driver meant that Norris’ win was not as comfortable as it had looked like it might be for much of the race. “The last quarter was a little bit nervous, with Charles close behind and Max (Verstappen) ahead. But we won in Monaco, so it doesn’t matter how you win, I guess,” said Norris. The victory means that the Englishman is the first McLaren driver to win in Monaco since Lewis Hamilton in 2008. The 25-year-old’s previous best finish on the historic track came in 2021, when he placed third. Leclerc finished second in his home race, with Piastri completing the podium. Verstappen came in fourth, one place ahead of Lewis Hamilton in fifth. Taking place on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, in easy view of the luxury yachts moored in the harbor, the Monaco Grand Prix has become synonymous with the glitz and glamor associated with F1 – Kylian Mbappé, Jeff Bezos and Naomi Campbell were among the celebrities in attendance on Sunday. This year’s Monaco Grand Prix saw new rules designed to liven up a race which, in recent years, has often not lived up to the spectacle surrounding it. Drivers must now pit at least twice, a ruling which aimed to avoid the kind of procession many fans complain can occur on the narrow, twisiting Monégasque roads on which overtaking is difficult. In reality, the rule’s main effect was that there was as much attention on how quickly drivers were able to pit as there was on the race itself. It also affected each driver’s race strategy; Verstappen, for example, waited until the very last moment to box for the second time in case there was a safety car, meaning he wouldn’t lose time in the pits and could hang on to his lead. As it was, there were no such incidents and he only succeeded in slowing down the race so the field bunched behind him. Further down the rankings, Isack Hadjar, Esteban Ocon, and Liam Lawson all did well to finish sixth, seventh and eighth respectively. Hadjar, in particular, benefited from teammate Lawson slowing down to hold off the chasing pack.",

The Americans were playing in an IIHF gold medal game for the first time in over 90 years and found themselves locked in a defensive struggle against a stalwart Swiss squad. Despite having a significant advantage in shots on goal, the US could not get a puck past Switzerland’s goaltender Leonardo Genoni through 60 minutes of regulation play. But just two minutes into the overtime period, Buffalo Sabres center Tage Thompson snuck a wrister past Genoni for the sudden death winner. The goal was assisted by Logan Cooley of the Utah Mammoth and Brady Skjei of the Nashville Predators. USA goalie Jeremy Swayman of the Boston Bruins stopped all 25 shots he faced to shut out the Swiss team. As Thompson was swarmed by his jubilant teammates after scoring the game-winner, many of the Swiss players could be seen hanging their heads in disappointment following the heartbreaking loss. But Switzerland was gracious in defeat as they shook hands with the Americans before the medal ceremony. After receiving their gold medals, the US national anthem was played as the American flag raised at Avicii Arena. The Stars and Stripes was straddled by the Swiss flag and the flag of Sweden, who won the bronze medal with a 6-2 victory against Denmark earlier on Sunday.

The 28-year-old overtook Marcus Ericsson entering turn 1 on lap 187 of 200 to secure his first-career Indy 500 win while making history at the same time. The Barcelona native became the first Spaniard to win the prized race and added yet another trophy to his impressive resume. After the checkered flag, Palou pulled up just past the Yard of Bricks, climbed out of his yellow and red No. 10 car, waved his fists to the cheering crowd on hand and made a long sprint to celebrate with his team and father after throwing his driving gloves off his hands. The celebration of winning the Indy 500 was not complete for Palou without drinking from a milk bottle before kissing the bricks. Palou said his racing career wouldn’t be complete with an Indy 500 victory. “I cannot believe it. What an amazing day. What an amazing race,” Palou told the Fox broadcast. “…It’s amazing. It’s amazing to be here. It’s amazing to win. There were some moments that I felt really good in the race but in the end I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to pass Marcus (Ericsson) or not. Made it happen. First oval win, what a better place.” Palou later added that he wasn’t sure what the win meant for Spain but he hoped they were celebrating. “Hopefully they are celebrating as much as I am here,” Palou told reporters. “It makes it extra special that I’m the first Spanish driver to win it, but honestly, if I was the 50th Spanish driver to win it, I would be as happy as I am now and as proud as I am now. “But hopefully that gets more fans, more people. There was a lot of Spanish flags here today, which I did never see, already on the parade laps that we had before the start of the race, that we were saying hello to the fans. I got to see the crowds, and there was a lot of Spanish flags. It’s pretty cool.” The Chip Ganassi Racing driver, who has won three IndyCar titles in four years, came into the race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway with four wins through the first five races this season and has now won his fifth. It was Indy 500 win number six for Ganassi Racing and team owner Chip Ganassi called his driver “unbelievable.” “I don’t know what else to say,” Ganassi said. “It is an incredible thing — it’s going to make Alex Palou’s career, it is going to make his life, and it has certainly made mine.” It was heartbreak for the 2022 Indy 500 winner Ericsson, who finished second for Andretti Global. The Swedish driver expressed his disappointment by putting his hands to his face after failing to get his second career win at the race. Ericsson did not mince his words, calling finishing runner up for the second time in his career “painful.” “I had the race covered,” Ericsson said. “I need to look at it again, you replay it in your head a million times after the finish, wondering what I could have done differently. Second means nothing in this race.” David Malukas was third for AJ Foyt Racing. American Josef Newgarden looked to win third consecutive Indy 500 but his race came to an end early after a fuel pump issue. His Team Penske teammate Will Power finished 19th in a miserable week for the team that has won the Indy 500 a record 20 times. Both Newgarden and Powers started from the rear of the field after failing inspection before qualifying. Earlier in the week, team owner Roger Penske, fired three of his team IndyCar executives for a second technical infraction in just over a year. For the second consecutive year, NASCAR star Kyle Larson’s quest to complete the famous “Double” of finishing both the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 in Charlotte, North Carolina, in the same day came to an unfortunate end. The 2021 NASCAR Cup Series champion crashed out on lap 91 after his car spun into the infield before colliding with the outside wall in turn 2 shortly after a restart, ultimately finishing in 27th place. The crash also involved drivers Sting Ray Robb and Kyffin Simpson, which ended their day as well. “Just a bit crazy there on the restart,” Larson said. “I got like, tight behind Takuma (Sato). I was really close in. … I got loose and kind of got all over the place, and yeah, so it spun. Just hate that – I got a little too eager on the restart. Hate it for everybody that got caught up in it. Yeah, bummed out. “Try to get over this quickly and try to get on to Charlotte. Just try to forget about it and try to win the next one.” Once again, you've shown the world your unmistakable talent. Show 'em how it's done today, . This was Larson’s second consecutive attempt to become the second driver ever to accomplish it, the first being Tony Stewart in 2001. Last year, kept him from completing the rare 1,100-mile feat. In 1994, John Andretti became the first driver to try to complete the Indy 500-Coca-Cola 600 double with Stewart, Robby Gordon and Kurt Busch also attempting it afterward. The “Double” is regarded as one of the toughest challenges in motorsport due to the mental and physical toll of driving 1,100 miles in a single day, navigating the differences between open-wheel and stock cars and the exhausting travel schedule. The day did not get any easier for Larson despite making it to Charlotte with plenty of time to spare. Larson was involved in a crash on lap 246 and was not able to finish the race. When asked if he would attempt the “double” for a third consecutive year, Larson was unsure. “The double is a tough undertaking,” Larson said. “The window of time is just too tight.”",

    "content": "It’s been a long-time coming, but return to pitching might not be far away. The Japanese star took a big step to returning to the mound on Sunday when he delighted the crowd at Citi Field ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers’ game against the New York Mets, facing hitters for the first time in almost two years. Ohtani threw 22 pitches across five simulated plate appearances. It’s the first time he’s faced hitters since undergoing a procedure to repair the right ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow in September 2023. Since then, Ohtani has only featured with the bat and his two-way game – which made him a global superstar – has been thwarted. On Sunday, the three-time MVP threw mostly fastballs, cutters and sinkers with his fastball hovering around 94-95 mph and maxing out at 97 mph. “I am aware that I do throw a little harder when there is a hitter in the box,” Ohtani said through interpreter Will Ireton, . “I try to keep it 93-94, but I know I was touching ‘6 and ‘7s, which I wanted to not do. But it’s a good sign that I could hit that.” Dodgers pitching coach Mark Prior said he was predominately happy with how performed against live hitters. “He looks good. He looked healthy,” Prior said. “That’s always the main thing with facing hitters. That he feels confident, his endurance is good, he maintained his stuff. From that standpoint, it was good. Pitch movement-wise, it looked good, too.” Ohtani faced Dalton Rushing, Kim Hye-seong and LA’s game planning coach JT Watkins in the live session. It might still be a while before Ohtani returns fully to the mound, however, with Dodgers manager Dave Roberts saying before the game that he likely wouldn’t be pitching for the team until after the All-Star break in mid-July: “He’s doing his first simulated game for two innings and in theory you got to build a starter up to five, six innings, and so just the natural progression, I just don’t see it being before that.” However, Sunday was a big step in that process and the three-time MVP was happy with his progress. “I haven’t thrown in a while, so it was nice to be able to feel like I was a pitcher,” Ohtani said. “I just kind of remembered those days when I used to have a lot of good memories as a pitcher.” Ohtani’s public workout was watched by a substantial on-looking crowd from the stands, as well as some Mets players, despite it being hours before the game. Although the Dodgers went onto lose 3-1 to the Mets – dropping their sixth game in the last nine – Ohtani maintained his good form with the bat, hitting his 18th home run of the season to keep him tied atop the 2025 leaderboard in HRs with Aaron Judge and Kyle Schwarber.",

    "content": "The theme of the Eastern Conference Finals so far has been comebacks and that continued on Sunday night in Indianapolis. After the Indiana Pacers’ miraculous Game 1 comeback, of the best-of-seven series saw the New York Knicks produce their own dramatic return off the ropes on the road at a raucous Gainbridge Fieldhouse. The Knicks trailed by as many as 20 points during the second quarter but, largely thanks to an inspired fourth-quarter performance from Karl-Anthony Towns, New York was able to rally for a 106-100 victory and cut the series deficit to 2-1. “It’s a true test when you’re down 20-plus,” Towns – who finished with 24 points and 15 rebounds on the night – told reporters afterwards. “Tonight was the kind of night where we had to have that never-say-die attitude.” Having left New York with two road victories and a firm grip on the series, Indiana returned home full of confidence and a pep in their step. And they took that momentum into Game 3, racing ahead while the Knicks looked like they were still on the plane. The Pacers’ lead was 20 at one point in the second quarter, but New York slowly cut the deficit to 10 as the fourth quarter began. But just as it looked like Indiana was going to take a 3-0 series lead and put one foot into the NBA Finals, Towns stepped up. The forward scored 20 and snatched eight rebounds in the final quarter while Indiana began misfiring on offense. In the previous three quarters, New York relied on balanced, but in crunchtime, it was Towns who became the go-to scorer. “The mantra of the team (is) unselfish guys,” Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau said afterwards. “When someone gets going, you try to keep him going. It’s recognizing what’s working.” While the Pacers opened the Eastern Conference Finals with a historical comeback, the Knicks are also well-accustomed to fighting back from the brink this postseason. They began their second round series against the defending champion Boston Celtics with two 20-point comebacks, with Sunday’s result making them the to pull off three such comebacks in a single postseason. For Indiana, it was a struggle on offense as the team scored its lowest total of the playoffs so far. In the 2025 postseason so far, the Pacers are 10-0 when they score 114 or more points but 0-3 when they don’t hit the mark. On Sunday, they missed 20 of their 25 three-point attempts which totaled their fewest makes, fewest attempts and worst shooting percentage from deep in the postseason so far, hitting an average of 14 previously. Tyrese Haliburton led the way for Indiana with 20 points as the home crowd – which included – went home disappointed. Game 4 of this topsy-turvy series – which Knicks star Jalen Brunson, who notched 23 points on Sunday, called “unpredictable” after Game 3 – will be played on Tuesday night.",

    "content": "Few athletes have become more synonymous with a single event than and the . The Spaniard won a record 14 titles at the clay-court grand slam during his illustrious career and Roland Garros gave its legendary champion one last special goodbye on Sunday. The 38-year-old, who from tennis last year, was honored during an emotional ceremony at the start of this year’s event and Nadal couldn’t hide his emotion. Thousands of fans, many wearing custom red tops with the message “Merci Rafa” written on them, greeted Nadal with a standing ovation as he walked out onto Court Philippe-Chatrier. A montage of Nadal’s highlights at the tournament then began playing on the big screens, leaving the 22-time grand slam champion with tears in his eyes. “This is tough,” Nadal , as he started his emotional speech. “I don’t know where to start after playing on this court for the past 20 years. Winning, losing, but especially being moved every time I’ve had the chance to be here.” Nadal went on to speak in both English and Spanish as he reminisced about his experiences playing at this event for the last 20 years, after making his debut as an 18-year-old. He finished with a stunning 112-4 record at the grand slam, winning all 14 of the finals he played on Court Philippe-Chatrier, somewhere he described as, “without doubt, the most important tennis court of my career.” Nadal’s voice then began to break as he thanked his team for supporting him over the years, notably his uncle Toni, who served as his main coach for much time. With emotions running high, Nadal was then joined by three of the biggest rivals during his career: Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. All four embraced in the middle of the court before Nadal thanked his three friends for all their support. “We showed the world that we can fight as hard as possible, but being good colleagues and respecting each other very well. And for me, it means a lot that you are all here,” Nadal said. “You gave me some hard times on court, honestly, but I really enjoyed pushing myself to the limit every single day to compete with all of you.” The near 50-minute ceremony ended with Nadal being presented with a plaque of his footprint, which will now be a permanent feature of the court. He was then joined by his two-year-old son as he waved to his adoring fans one last time. “I can no longer play in front of you anymore, but my heart and my memories will always be linked to this magical place,” he said. This year’s French Open kicked off with the first round on Sunday, with no major upsets yet. Spanish star , who many see as the heir to Nadal’s throne, is in action on Monday against Italian Giulio Zeppieri. Alcaraz, 22, was in the crowd to bid farewell to his hero on Sunday.",

    "content": "Their commentary is breathless. Literally. Australian twin brothers Archie and Miles Shephard have become internet stars for their high-energy and comedically nuanced interpretations of some of the most dramatic moments in . But if you were in the bedroom where they shoot their material, like , you’d hardly hear a thing. “I feel like it’s a whisper,” said Archie in an interview with , noting that the lip synching of the original commentary only requires them to mime the words. “It’s a soft yell, if I was yelling then I’d have no voice!” Shepmates, as the duo is known, began almost by accident. The 23-year-old identical twins were working together as salesmen at a timber yard in 2021 and Miles was listening to the Ashes on the radio. When the Australian bowler Mitchell Starc claimed an English wicket with the very first ball of the match, the commentator’s contagious enthusiasm inspired him to film his own reenactment of the call. “It was Covid, so I was bored,” he recalled, “and I just filmed this video and the next morning it blew up and people were asking for more. And then Archie was like, ‘Can I get in on this?’” They spent the rest of the summer generating more cricket content, honing their craft as a double act and building a devoted following. Sometimes, their material has been flagged for copyright infringement, but when the International Cricket Council targeted one of their early World Cup clips, it worked to their advantage. “Ten hours later, it got taken down, our account got banned,” Miles said. “I reached out to the ICC, and we’re like, ‘Why are you banning this? People love this!’ So, they brought our account back and they actually collaborated on the video with us, and it went absolutely bananas.” Sport is not just a live broadcast product, the action is now being repackaged across disparate media platforms, finding new audiences in faraway places. and are now enjoyed in hitherto unexpected markets thanks to the reach of “Full Swing” and “Drive to Survive” on Netflix. Shepmates have been able to tap into this new trend, covering everything from soccer to basketball, mountain biking and darts. Their spoof of Donald Trump and Joe Biden bickering about who was the better golfer was conceived and recorded while the CNN presidential debate was still ongoing, and released immediately afterward. It’s been seen around 20 million times. No sport is off the table – Shepmates say that sperm racing could even be in the pipeline soon. Sitting side by side and wearing broadcast headsets, they dress according to the sport they are covering and exchange either smug, knowing glances or accusatory and puzzled looks. At the crescendo of each play that they feature, the scene often descends into chaos; when filming , Archie rocked the camera for dramatic effect as Miles threw a chair across the room, damaging the wall: “The landlord wasn’t happy.” When the darts commentator Wayne Mardle gasped, “I can’t speak, I can’t speak,” the Shepmates’ interpretation of the moment spoofed a commentator falling backwards in a state of medical distress. The brothers often switch positions in their pretend commentary box, making it impossible to tell which one is which, and sometimes they’re even able to quickly duck out of shot, change their appearance and re-appear as a third character just seconds later. They’ve become skilled at repackaging the energy and joy of sport with a humorous twist, their repertoire has found a global audience and they’ve been able to quit the lumber yard and focus full-time on the Shepmates media brand. Initially, each shoot was labor intensive. Miles said that he used to spend hours trying to memorize every line – “a nightmare.” Now, they write the lines out on a screen, using a series of commas and dots to time their delivery. “It doesn’t matter how good our facial expressions or the comedy,” Miles explained, “if the lip-sync’s not good then people aren’t going to watch it.” He’s become an expert in mimicking Spanish and Arabic commentary, but admits he has no idea what they’re saying. “Most of the clips we can nail in four or five shots, we have a ball,” said Archie, “But you start screwing up, then it starts to wear a bit towards the end, like you’ve heard this commentary close to 40 times and by the time you put it out, you’re like, ‘I don’t even know if this is funny.’” Their fans would argue that the labor of love is well worth it, and so far, they say that the commentators they’ve covered approve of their work, but in 2024 they were accused of a gross invasion of privacy when they filmed in the urinal. “That was a big moment for us,” Miles explained, “It felt like we were on top of the world, and I think we probably just got a bit ahead of ourselves and we made a mistake. We were like, ‘Jeez, are we bad humans for doing this?’ We apologized to George. I wouldn’t change it, I’m glad it happened. It made us realize we’re not invincible, I think it’s made us better.” Archie and Miles have grown up together, they still live together and now they’re embarking on a dream career together that they could never have imagined when they were making videos together as kids. Miles acknowledges that they have suffered from an imposter syndrome. “Do we deserve all this?” he asked. “A lot of the time we’re worried it’s going to get taken away from us.” “We tried to become professional athletes and failed at that,” Archie added, “So I think the stars aligned with sports and content.” In a manner that they never could have imagined, they have found their calling.",

    "content": "has been angered by a refereeing decision which the club says was a “major contributing factor” in missing out on a spot in the Champions League. The controversial moment in question occurred in the 73rd minute of Villa’s game against on Sunday, when the final round of Premier League matches took place. United goalkeeper Altay Bayındır fumbled the ball on the edge of his area, allowing Villa forward Morgan Rogers to take possession and put the ball into the net. The incident would have given Villa a 1-0 lead, but referee Thomas Bramall judged that Bayındır had been in control of the ball and immediately whistled for a United free-kick, rather than letting play continue. As a result, the goal didn’t stand and the incident couldn’t be reviewed by the video assistant referee (VAR). “Aston Villa can confirm the club has written to the (refereeing body) PGMOL to raise concerns over the selection process of match officials following today’s game with Manchester United at Old Trafford,” the club said in a statement on Sunday. “With such high stakes surrounding today’s fixture, the club believe a more experienced referee should have been appointed. Of the 10 referees to officiate across the Premier League today, Mr. Bramall was the 2nd least experienced.” It added: “Ultimately, we acknowledge that the outcome for us will not change, but we believe that it is important to address the selection methodology to ensure that high stakes matches are treated as such with regards to officiating and to ensure that the implemented VAR technology is allowed to be effective.” has contacted the PGMOL, which oversees officiating in English soccer, for comment about the incident and on behalf of Bramall. The Premier League declined to comment. According to , Bramall has officiated 11 Premier League games this season, with 17 referees taking charge of more games. In an with TNT Sports, Villa manager Unai Emery said that Bramall had admitted to him that a mistake was made and that play should have been allowed to continue. “We have to accept it,” said Emery. “Of course, it was a mistake, a big mistake.” Amad Diallo gave United the lead shortly after the incident before Christian Eriksen’s penalty in the 87th minute completed a 2-0 victory for the home side. A draw or win would have seen Villa, which played half the match with 10 men after goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez’s red card, finish in the top five and qualify for the Champions League for the second season in a row. However, the club will instead play in the second-tier Europa League after placing sixth, level on points with Newcastle United but behind on goal difference. Qualifying for the Champions League comes with a huge financial boost for clubs. The 36 teams which qualified for last season’s competition each earned a payment of around $21.2 million (€18.62 million). By contrast, qualifying for the Europa League is worth around $4.9 million (€4.31 million) to a club. “It’s tough to take, especially in the circumstances,” midfielder John McGinn TNT Sports. “I don’t think any of us in the dressing room, anyone watching the game, felt like we deserved to win. Man United deserved to win … but the decision is incredible. He added: “It’s so, so hard to take, especially when the impact it has on us as a team and as a club is so big.”",

Altmaier triumphed 7-5, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 against fourth-seed Fritz, who becomes the first major casualty of the men’s draw at Roland-Garros. The loss marks Fritz’s earliest exit at the French Open since 2018 and his earliest at any grand slam since the 2022 US Open. “It was very special,” said Altmaier after recording his fifth victory against an opponent ranked inside the top 10, the ATP Tour. “I think I was working really hard the past weeks to get confidence, preparing myself for those kinds of matches. “I feel like I’m ready to play whoever is going to face me. I’m really happy to get this first win and I really love my performance.” The world No. 66 will next face the Czech Republic’s Vit Kopriva in the second round on Wednesday. Having finished runner-up to Jannik Sinner at last year’s US Open, Fritz has now had two disappointing defeats at majors this season – the loss against Altmaier adding to a third-round exit at the Australian Open in January. He converted just one of his five break points in Monday’s match and managed 34 winners – 14 of which were aces – compared to Altmaier’s 46. The 27-year-old Fritz wasn’t the only high-ranked American to lose in the opening round at Roland-Garros. In the women’s draw, ninth seed Emma Navarro was thrashed 6-0, 6-1 by Spain’s Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in just 57 minutes. According to , Navarro is the third woman seeded in the top 10 to win just one game in the first round of a grand slam, following Monica Seles at the 2001 Australian Open and Anna Chakvetadze at the 2008 Australian Open. Elsewhere in the women’ draw, Spanish 10th seed Paula Badosa triumphed 6-7(1), 6-1, 6-4 against four-time grand slam champion Naomi Osaka, who wore pink bows in her hair and an outfit inspired by the cherry blossoms of her native Japan. It means that Osaka, currently ranked No. 49 in the world, has not progressed past the second round of the French Open since 2019.",

    "content": "Indiana Fever star has been ruled out for at least two weeks after suffering a left quadriceps strain, the team announced Monday. Clark, the WNBA’s 2024 rookie of the year, will miss four games during that span. This includes two Commissioner’s Cup games – one of those coming June 7 on the road against the and Angel Reese. The much-documented rivalry between the second-year WNBA stars began in college when Reese’s LSU beat Clark’s Iowa for the 2023 national championship, and continued when Clark won in the Elite Eight in front of a television audience of 12.3 million. In their most recent meeting, which came May 17, the Fever beat the Sky 93-58, when Clark notably was called for a for hard contact on Reese. Both players have played down the rivalry, but their fan bases are often vociferous in their dislike of the opposing player. Clark, 23, has had an impressive start to her second year in the WNBA. The guard has averaged 19 points, 9.3 assists and six rebounds through the opening four games of the 2025 season. After reaching the playoffs last year, a revamped Indiana roster has championship aspirations this season. The Fever sit at 2-2 to start the season having suffered close losses to the Atlanta Dream and the New York Liberty. In addition to missing the June 7 contest against the Sky, Clark will also miss Wednesday’s game on the road against the Washington Mystics before being absent for two home games: one coming against the Connecticut Sun on Friday and then a Commissioner’s Cup game against the Mystics on June 3. The Fever said further updates on Clark will be available following re-evaluation. CNN’s Ben Morse and Jill Martin contributed to reporting.",

    "content": "Dozens of people, including four children, were injured when a driver plowed a car into a parade in northwest England celebrating Liverpool Football Club’s latest Premier League win on Monday evening. A 53-year-old white British man from the Liverpool area, believed to be the driver, was arrested at the scene, according to Merseyside Police. Describing the collision as an “isolated incident,” police said they were not looking for any other suspects and were not treating the incident as terrorism. Police will reveal the findings of an investigation into the collision so that “all the facts are known,” according to Liverpool’s mayor, Steve Rotheram. “It’s not for people on social media to be speculating what happened,” the mayor told CNN on Tuesday, describing the “terrible event” late Monday. “The police are the only people who have all of that information to hand – and they are the people we should trust.” Footage from Reuters news agency on Tuesday morning shows the scene littered with debris and closed off with police tape. A police van is parked across the street, blocking the road. Hundreds of thousands of jubilant soccer fans had lined the streets in the heart of Liverpool on Monday, waving flags and flares of red smoke, to watch an open-top bus victory parade to celebrate the iconic club’s 20th top-flight league title. As the parade was winding down, those scenes of joy turned to chaos. Video from social media appears to show a gray minivan plowing into red-clad supporters. The angry crowd can then be seen surrounding and rocking the stopped vehicle. A total of 27 people were taken to hospital, the head of service at North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust David Kitchin told a news conference. Four of those were “very ill in hospital,” according to Rotheram. Four people – three adults and one child – had to be removed because they were trapped underneath the vehicle, according to Chief Fire Officer of Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service Nick Searle. A further 20 people were treated at the scene for minor injuries, he added. “This gray people carrier just pulled up from the right and just rammed into all the people at the side of us … It was extremely fast. Initially, we just heard the pop, pop, pop of people just being knocked off the bonnet of a car,” one fan, Harry Rashid, told the UK’s PA Media news agency. Rashid, who attended the parade with his wife and two young daughters, said crowds of people ran over and started to smash the car’s windows. “It was horrible. And you could hear the bumps as he was going over the people … I saw people lying on the ground, people unconscious. It was horrendous. So horrendous,” he said. Video posted on social media appears to show a confrontation between the driver and the crowd at one point during the incident. The car is seen stopped and some in the crowd can be seen kicking and punching the car, which then quickly reverses before driving off. Onlooker Matthew O’Carroll told Britain’s PA news agency that he saw the car approaching the top of Water Street. He said the vehicle drove past a parked police van at a “decent” speed and that the driver was beeping as he went through the crowd. Footage shared by Reuters news agency showed emergency services tending to people, some being carried into ambulances on stretchers. Photos from the scene also showed authorities cordoning off the heavily littered roads. Police set up a tent where the crash occurred. “We heard a frantic beeping ahead, a car flew past me and my mate, people were chasing it and trying to stop him, windows smashed at the back,” Peter Jones, who had traveled to Liverpool to attend the parade, told the Associated Press. “He then drove into people, police and medics ran past us, and people were being treated on the side of the road.” The local police force said they were contacted just after 6 p.m. local time (1 p.m. ET) “following reports a car had been in collision with a number of pedestrians” in the city center. Merseyside Police said it had been working with the organizers of the parade and a “robust traffic management” plan was put in place before the incident unfolded. “Extensive enquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances leading up to the collision and it is vital that people do not speculate or spread misinformation on social media,” Merseyside Police’s Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims said in a statement. The parade on Monday – which coincided with a separate May public holiday in the UK – involved players from the Liverpool squad being driven around the city center in an open-top bus and gleeful fans had joined the festivities along the 10-mile (16 kilometers) route. Figures from across the sporting world paid tribute to those who were injured by the attack, which survivors say left the city reeling after the celebrations. Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, who attended the parade, said he was “shocked and devastated.” “Our thoughts and prayers are with all those who are injured and affected,” he posted on Instagram. “You’ll never walk alone,” he added, in reference to the club’s anthem. A titan of world soccer, the German notably led Liverpool to its first league title in 30 years, in 2020. Longtime opponents Manchester United and, Everton Football Club, the local rival team to Liverpool FC, offered their condolences online – as did the Premier League. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the whole country “stands with Liverpool” on Tuesday. “My thoughts and the thoughts of the whole country are with all of those that are affected, those injured, which of course includes children, their families, their friends… Liverpool fans everywhere,” the prime minister added, thanking emergency services “who did a fantastic job and continue to do so.” CNN’s Nic Robertson contributed reporting from Liverpool, northern England.",

    "content": "enjoyed arguably the best playoff game of his career to lead the Oklahoma City Thunder to a 128-126 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves and to within one game of the Finals. After suffering a 42-point beatdown in Game 3, the Thunder led the Timberwolves for the vast majority of a tight Game 4, never trailing after the opening seven minutes. Oklahoma City’s lead grew to 11 at the start of the third quarter – the largest lead of the night for either team – and, behind Gilgeous-Alexander’s blistering offensive display, managed to hold off a couple of late runs from the T-Wolves. Gilgeous-Alexander was close to a triple-double in a stellar all-around performance, posting a career playoff-high 40 points to go with nine rebounds and another career postseason-high 10 assists. “We did a good job of staying in the moment tonight,” Gilgeous-Alexander said afterwards. “We obviously had a bad taste in our mouth from the last game, and we just wanted to control the things that we could control tonight. “I think staying in the moment was the best way to do so. We could have been better tonight for sure. Tonight wasn’t perfect, but we gave ourselves a chance … and we got a W.” Jalen Williams continues to show why he is one of the best No. 2s in the league with an efficient 34 points, five assists and three steals, while Chet Holmgren added another 21 points for the Thunder. For Minnesota, it was another quiet night for young superstar Anthony Edwards who has struggled this series against the many looks of Oklahoma’s defense. Edwards lamented after Game 1 that he only “took 13 f**king shots,” before doubling his shot attempts for Game 2. However, in Minnesota’s Game 3 blowout, Edwards’ attempts were down at 17 and then back down to 13 for Game 4. Edwards finished with 16 points on 5-of-13 shooting, including 1-of-7 from three-point range. After bouncing back in Game 3 from a poor Game 2 showing, Julius Randle struggled again in Game 4 and finished with a . Minnesota was kept in the contest by 22 points from starting forward Jaden McDaniels and 23 and 21 points, respectively, from Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Donte DiVincenzo off the bench. “I don’t really look at it like I struggled,” Edwards said postgame. “I didn’t get enough shots to say I struggled, so that might be how you guys look at it. But, yeah, I didn’t struggle at all. I just made the right play.” Randle said he thought his own performance was “a lot of me just spectating.” “I got to figure out a way to get myself involved in actions,” Randle added. “I think I didn’t take my first shot in the second half until there were 20 seconds left in the third quarter. “I got to figure out a way to get myself in position to be more aggressive, rather than just standing, spectating or trying to crash the glass.” The series returns to Oklahoma City for Game 5 on Wednesday when the Thunder will be bidding to make a first Finals appearance since 2012.",
